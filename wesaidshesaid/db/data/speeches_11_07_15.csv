LACY CRAWFORD, JR., AND PHIL CONTRINO, FIRST ANALYST AT BOX OFFICE.COM. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS IS WIDELY KNOWN IN VERMONT SIMPLY AS BERNIE. HE BEGAN A LIFE OF ACTIVISM AS A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WHERE HE LED US IT INTO PROTEST DISCRIMINATORY POLICY -- HOUSING POLICIES. AFTER GRADUATING AND LIVING ON AN ISRAELI CABINETS, HE MOVED TO VERMONT AND HAD A SERIES OF JOBS IN AREAS RANGING FROM FILMMAKING TO CARPENTRY. HE RAN AND LOST AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE FOR SEVERAL OFFICES BEFORE WINNING A RACE FOR MAYOR OF BURLINGTON IN 1981. HIS MARGIN OF VICTORY WAS 10 VOTES. SANDERS GAINED POPULARITY BY PROMOTING BURLINGTON'S LOCAL BUSINESSES, FIXING POTHOLES, AND RINGING A MINOR-LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM TO TOWN. VERMONTERS ELECTED HIM TO THE HOUSE IN 1990 AND TO THE SENATE IN 2007. WHEN SANDERS ARRIVED ON CAPITOL HILL, HE WAS THE ONLY INDEPENDENT IN THE HOUSE. HE HAS GONE ON TO BECOME THE LONGEST-SERVING INDEPENDENT IN CONGRESSIONAL HISTORY. HE CAUCUSES WITH THE DEMOCRATS AND HE HAS BECOME THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SANDERS SPEAKS OUT FREQUENTLY ON ISSUES HE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT SUCH AS CUTTING MILITARY SPENDING, TAKING ACTION TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, AND WORKING TO REDUCE INCOME INEQUALITY. IN 2010, HE CONDUCTED A NEARLY NINE HOUR FILIBUSTER AGAINST TAX CUTS FOR WEALTHY AMERICANS. SO MANY PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIS EFFORT ONLINE, THAT THE SENATE VIDEO SERVER CRASHED. THESE DAYS, SANDERS IS CONSIDERING A BID IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND WHAT BETTER PLACE WITH THERE BE TO ANNOUNCE SUCH A BID AND THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB? [APPLAUSE] NOT THAT WE ARE SUGGESTING ANYTHING HERE, SENATOR. SANDERS HAS ALSO BEEN TINKERING WITH HIS CRUSTY PERSONA. AS THE BOSTON GLOBE RECENTLY WROTE, ""SANDERS IS AN ISSUES ORIENTED CLASS WARRIOR WHO HAS BEGUN TO LISTEN UP ON THE STUMP, SOFTENING HIS TERM URGENTLY DEMEANOR WITH AN OCCASIONAL JOKE."" [LAUGHTER] WE AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB HAVE ALSO BEEN KNOWN TO RELAX OUR TERM I GENTLY DEMEANORS FROM TIME TO TIME. WE WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW BY GIVING A WARM WELCOME TO VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. BEFORE I BEGIN THE THRUST OF MY REMARKS, LET ME GIVE YOU A VERY SHORT THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF MY POLITICAL LIFE BECAUSE MY JOURNEY HERE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN MANY OF MY SENATE COLLEAGUES. AS JOHN MENTIONED, I WAS BORN IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK IN 1941. MY FATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM POLAND AT THE AGE OF 17 WITHOUT A PENNY IN HIS POCKET AND WITHOUT MUCH OF AN EDUCATION. I ALWAYS THINK BACK ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY BRAVERY THAT WAS HIS, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE COUNTRY WITH SO LITTLE. MY MOM GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY. MY DAD WORKED FOR ALMOST HIS ENTIRE LIFE AS A PAINT SALESMAN. MY PARENTS -- MY PARENTS, MY BROTHER, AND I LIVED IN A SMALL RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT. MY DREAM WAS TO MOVE OUT OF THAT APARTMENT -- MY MOTHER FILTERING WAS TO MOVE OUT OF THAT APARTMENT AND BUY A HOME. SHE DIED YOUNG AND NEVER REALIZE THAT DREAM. I LEARNED WHAT MONEY MEANS TO A FAMILY AND THAT IS A LESSON I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN. MY WIFE JANE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED OR 27 YEARS. WE HAVE FOUR GREAT KIDS AND SEVEN BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILDREN. AND WITHOUT TRYING TO BE OVERLY DRAMATIC ABOUT IT, THE REASON POLITICALLY WHY I DO WHAT I DO IS TO MAKE SURE THESE KIDS AND ALL OF OUR CHILDREN CAN LIVE IN A WONDERFUL COUNTRY IN A WONDERFUL WORLD. REPRESENTING THE GREAT STATE OF VERMONT, AS JOHN INDICATED, I AM THE LONGEST SERVING INDEPENDENT IN AMERICAN CONGRESSIONAL HISTORY. I SERVED 16 YEARS IN THE HOUSE, AND AS VERMONT'S LOAN CONGRESSMAN, AND IN 2006 I WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE AND REELECTED IN 2012. I BEGAN MY RATHER UNUSUAL POLITICAL CAREER BACK IN 1971 AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. SENATE ON A SMALL THIRD-PARTY CALLED THE LIBERTY UNION, AND I RECEIVED 2% OF THE VOTE. A YEAR LATER I RAN FOR GOVERNOR AS THESE -- OF THE STATE OF VERMONT AND RECEIVED 1% OF THE VOTE. [LAUGHTER] NOT BEING THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT ON THE BLOCK, IRAN AGAIN FOR THE SENATE AND RECEIVED 4% OF THE VOTE AND TWO YEARS LATER IRAN I RAN FOR GOVERNOR AND RECEIVED 6% OF THE VOTE. I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THE PEOPLE OF VERMONT A BREAK AND I RETIRED FROM POLITICS IN 1976. REMEMBERING ONE PARTICULAR GUY WHO SAID, BERNIE, I PROMISE I WILL VOTE FOR YOU IF YOU PROMISE ME YOU WILL NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN -- IN 1981, I WAS PERSUADED BY FRIENDS TO RUN FOR MAYOR OF BURLINGTON, THE LARGEST CITY IN OUR STATE AGAINST A FIVE-TERM DEMOCRATIC MAYOR. I RAN AS AN INDEPENDENT. NOBODY, BUT NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WE HAD A CHANCE TO WIN. WE DID. AND THAT VERY REMARKABLE ELECTION, WE PUT TOGETHER AN EXTRAORDINARY COALITION OF WORKERS AND TRADE UNIONISTS, OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS, OF ACTIVISTS, OF LOW INCOME ORGANIZATIONS, OF WOMAN'S -- WOMEN'S GROUPS. IN THAT TYPE OF COALITION POLITICS, BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND A PROGRESSIVE AGENDA CHANGED MY VIEW OF POLITICS TODAY. IN A CAMPAIGN THAT COST $4000, I, AND THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED ME, KNOCKED ON THOUSANDS OF DOORS IN THE CITY, AND LET ME TELL YOU, IT GETS COLD IN VERMONT IN MARCH. ON ELECTION NIGHT WHEN THE VOTES WERE COUNTED, WE WON THE WORKING CLASS WARDS I SOMETHING LIKE TWO TO ONE AND WON THE ELECTION BY ALL OF 14 VOTES. IT WAS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL UPSET IN MODERN VERMONT HISTORY AND AFTER THE RECOUNT, THE MARGIN OF VICTORY WAS REDUCED TO 10 VOTES. I TOOK OFFICE WITH 11 OUT OF 13 MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, IN VERY STRONG OPPOSITION TO MY AGENDA. AND IF MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM THINK THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GOTTEN A ROUGH TIME FROM REPUBLICANS, THAT WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT I AM I SUPPORTERS EXPERIENCE DOING MY FIRST -- DURING MY FIRST YEAR OF OFFICE. A YEAR LATER, A SLATE OF CANDIDATES WORKING WITH ME SUCCEEDED A NUMBER OF INCUMBENT OBSTRUCTIONISTS. A YEAR AFTER THAT, THE VOTER TURNOUT WAS ALMOST DOUBLED FROM WHAT IT WAS WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED. I EASILY DEFEATED A DEMOCRATIC AND A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, CONTINUE TO GET REELECTED. IN 1988, IRAN FOR THE U.S. CONGRESS IN A THREE-WAY RACE -- IN 1988, I RAN FOR THE U.S. CONGRESS IN A THREE-WAY RACE. TWO YEARS LATER, I RAN THAT ELECTION WITH 16% MORE OF THE VOTE. A CANDIDATE WHO SPENT THREE TIMES MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE HAD EVER SPENT BEFORE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY, AND RAN A VERY, VERY NEGATIVE RACE WAS WHO I WAS AGAINST. I RAN AND FOR REELECTION I GOT 71% OF THE VOTE. AS MAYOR OF ARLINGTON, MY ADMINISTRATION TOOK ON VIRTUALLY EVERY SPECIAL AND POWERFUL INTEREST IN THE CITY AND IN THE STATE. AGAINST THE WISHES OF DEVELOPERS AND RAILROADS, WE CREATED A BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE ORIENTED WATERFRONT AND WALKWAY AND BIKEWAY ALONG LAKE CHAMPLAIN. WE WON NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR URBAN BEAUTIFICATION BY PLANTING THOUSANDS OF TREES THROUGHOUT THE CITY, AND WE MADE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR STREETS AND SIDEWALKS. WE IMPLEMENTED THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM THEN IN THE STATE'S HISTORY OF BUILDING A NEW WASTEWATER FACILITY TO PREVENT UNTREATED WASTE FROM GOING INTO THE LAKE. WE STARTED A YOUTH OFFICE WHICH CREATED BEAUTIFUL DAY CAMPS, A LITTLE LEAGUE PROGRAM, AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH CONTINUE TO EXIST TODAY. WE WERE THE FIRST CITY IN VERMONT TO BREAK ITS DEPENDENCE ON A REGRESSIVE PROPERTY TAX. WE MADE CHANGES TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF COMMUNITY POLICING. WE HAD A VERY ACTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL ARTS PROGRAM. AND THE RESULT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, BURLINGTON HAS BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND LIVABLE SMALL CITIES IN AMERICA, AND I INVITE ALL OF YOU NOT ONLY TO VISIT BURLINGTON, BUT TO VISIT OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE OF VERMONT. IN 1990, I BECAME THE FIRST INDEPENDENT ELECTED TO THE U.S. HOUSE IN 40 YEARS. WE FORMED A CAUCUS THAT STANDS AS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MORE IMPORTANT CAUCUSES, DOING A GREAT JOB REPRESENTING WORKING FAMILIES. ONE OF THE FIRST VOTES IN THE HOUSE I CAST WAS AGAINST THE FIRST GULF WAR. I BELIEVE THAT HISTORY WILL RECORD THAT WAS THE RIGHT VOTE. [APPLAUSE] AS WAS THE VOTE I CAST YEARS LATER AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ, AND WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE ONE OF THE WORST FOREIGN-POLICY BLUNDERS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THAT WAR -- AND I THINK AS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE VETERANS COMMITTEE, WHAT THE COST THAT WAR IS. THAT COST DOES NOT ONLY BE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL AND BRAVE YOUNG MEN IN WOMEN, BUT IT ALSO CREATED THE SITUATION WHERE TODAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, 500,000 MEN AND WOMEN HAVE COME HOME FROM IRAQI AND AFGHANISTAN WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESSES ORDER AND DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY. THEY HAVE COME HOME WITH A LOSS OF ARMS AND LEGS AND EYESIGHT AND THEIR HEARING. BEFORE WE GET INVOLVED IN ANOTHER WAR, WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHAT WAR IS REALLY ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT WAR IN IRAQ ALSO DESTABILIZED THE ENTIRE REGION AND OPENED UP THE CAN OF WORMS WE NOW SEE. WE HAVE THE ORGANIZATION CALLED ISIS AND WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR REMAINING INFLUENCE OVER IRAQ. I WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO LED THE FIGHT AGAINST TD REGULATION OF WALL STREET -- THE DEREGULATION OF WALL STREET. IN RETROSPECT, I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE TODAY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA TO AND GLASS-STEAGALL -- TO END GLASS-STEAGALL AND ALLOW ACTIVITY ON WALL STREET TO GO UNCHECKED. [APPLAUSE] I ALSO STRONGLY OPPOSE THE TRADE AGREEMENTS WRITTEN BY CORPORATE AMERICA AND HAVE GOTTEN SUPPORT FROM DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, LIKE NAFTA, CAP TO, WHICH HAVE LED THIS COUNTRY INTO A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP TRADE AGREEMENT. [APPLAUSE] WHILE IN THE HOUSE, I TOOK ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES THEY CHARGE OUR PEOPLE AND BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO TAKE AMERICANS ACROSS THE CANADIAN BORDER TO PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THERE, AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT TRIP WHERE WOMEN STRUGGLING WITH BREAST CANCER BOUGHT THE MEDICINE THEY NEEDED FOR 1/10 OF THE PRICE IN MONTREAL THAT THEY WERE PAYING IN THE UNITED STATES. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS TODAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, SADLY, HAVE TO CONTINUE BUYING THEIR MEDICINE IN CANADA RATHER THAN LOCAL PHARMACIES. AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE VETERANS COMMITTEE, I WORKED HARD IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO PASS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT VETERANS LEGISLATION PASSED IN MANY, MANY YEARS. WE PUT $15 BILLION INTO IMPROVING VETERANS HEALTH CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO DEFEND US GET THE BEST QUALITY HEALTH CARE POSSIBLE AND GET IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND I HAVE -- [APPLAUSE] AND ONE OF T WONHERFUL HONORS I HAVE RECEIVED IN RECENT YEARS IS TO BE THE RECIPIENT OF THE HIGHEST AWARDS FROM THE AMERICAN LEGION AND THE VFW AND I'M VERY, VERY GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR THAT. AS SOMEONE CONCERNED ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND OUR DYSFUNCTIONAL HARROP CARE -- HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, I WORKED WITH JIM CLYBURN TO PUT SOME $12 BILLION INTO QUALIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WHICH RESULTED IN SOME 4 MILLION LOWER INCOME AMERICANS GAINING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, DENTAL CARE, LOW-COST ASCRIPTION DRUGS, AND MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING. WE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICES BOARD. THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THESE EFFORTS, AND IN MY VIEW, THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN ONE OF THE SUCCESS STORIES OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AS ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE SENATE TRYING TO COMBAT THE CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I HELPED CREATE THE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM THAT PUT BILLIONS INTO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WORKING WITH SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES, I FORMED THE SOCIAL SECURITY CAUCUS AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN READING BACK AND MASSIVE EFFORT TO CUT PROGRAMS, SOCIAL SECURITY, AND BENEFITS FROM SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS AN EFFORT I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE. [APPLAUSE] NOW, THAT IS A VERY BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF MY LIFE AND POLITICAL HISTORY. LET ME START WITH SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT, AND THAT IS THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU NOW, I SUSPECT NOT MANY PEOPLE COME UP TO TALK ABOUT, BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS BEING TOO GRUFF, A GRUMPY GRANDFATHER, I HAVE TO LIVE UP TO MY REPUTATION. SO I WILL BE GRUFF, I WILL BE ABRUPT, AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK. TODAY IN A NATION PLAGUED BY MANY, MANY CONCERNS, THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM WE FACE IS THE GROTESQUE AND GROWING LEVEL OF WEALTH AND INCOME INEQUALITY. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A PROFOUND MORAL ISSUE. IT IS A PROFOUND ECONOMIC ISSUE. AND AS A RESULT OF CITIZENS UNITED, IT IS A PROFOUND POLITICAL ISSUE. IT IS THE ISSUE THAT IMPACTS ALL OTHER ISSUES. JOB CREATION, HEALTH CARE, CLIMATE CHANGE, THE ENVIRONMENT, EDUCATION, YOU NAME IT. THEY ARE ALL FUNDAMENTALLY IMPACTED BY INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. LET ME BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU AND TELL YOU WHAT VERY FEW ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL TELL YOU. AND THAT IS THAT GIVEN THE INCREDIBLE POWER OF THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS OVER THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THIS COUNTRY, OVER POLITICS, OVER MEDIA, I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, THE STRUGGLE FOR A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS, THESE STRUGGLE -- THE STRUGGLE FOR A VIBRANT DEMOCRACY IN WHICH ELECTIONS ARE NOT BOUGHT ONE NOT BE ONE IN OUR LIFETIME UNLESS AN UNPRECEDENTED GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT IS DEVELOPED WHICH IS PREPARED TO TAKE ON AND DEFEAT THE POWER OF THE 1%. [APPLAUSE] OVER THIS LAST WEEKEND, MY WIFE AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT SELMA, ALABAMA AND MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, ALONG WITH MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS TO HONOR THE INCREDIBLE BRAVERY OF THOSE WHO MARCHED AND WERE BEATEN ON BLOODY SUNDAY 50 YEARS AGO. I WAS THERE WITH MY GOOD FRIEND JOHN LEWIS AND MANY OTHERS. STANDING OUTSIDE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING'S SMALL AND MODEST DEXTER AVENUE CHURCH IN MONTGOMERY, I WAS REMINDED THAT REAL CHANGE NEVER TAKES PLACE WITHOUT STRUGGLE, WITHOUT THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARED TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR JUSTICE, PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARED TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE IN THOSE STRUGGLES. THESE POLITICAL BATTLE OF THIS TIME IS NOT REPUBLICANS VERSUS DEMOCRATS. IT IS NOT THE POLITICAL GAINS INSIDE THE BELTWAY THAT PREOCCUPY MUCH OF THE MEDIA'S ATTENTION, IT IS NOT THE UGLY 32ND TV AD THAT FLOOD OUR AIRWAVES. THE CHALLENGE AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY IS A DECLINING MIDDLE CLASS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOW WAGES, IF THEY ARE LUCKY OUGH TO HAVE JOBS, AGAINST THE POWER OF A BILLIONAIRE CLASS WHOSE GREED HAS NO END. [APPLAUSE] IT IS THE STRUGGLE OF AMERICANS, BLACK, WHITE, HISPANIC, ASIAN, NATIVE AMERICAN, WOMEN AND MEN, GAY AND STRAIGHT. THE STRUGGLE FOR DECENT JOBS, ADEQUATE INCOMES TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES, STRUGGLING FOR RETIREMENT SECURITY, STRUGGLING FOR DECENT EDUCATION WITH THEIR KIDS, STRUGGLING FOR HEALTH CARE, STRUGGLING FOR DIGNITY AGAINST THE GREED AND POWER OF A FEW ON TOP WHO APPARENTLY WANTED ALL. -- WANT IT ALL. ECONOMICALLY, THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS, ONCE THE ENVY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS BEEN IN DECLINE. DESPITE EXPLODING TECHNOLOGY, DESPITE INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY, DESPITE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE INCREASE IN TRADE, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TODAY ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOW WAGES AND WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY TODAY THAN ALMOST ANY TIME IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF AMERICA. TODAY, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT 5.5%. REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS A 11%, AND IF YOU INCLUDE THOSE WORKERS WHO HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR WORK OR WORKING PART-TIME WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS UP TO 30%. SHAMEFULLY, WE HAVE BY FAR THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH, AND DESPITE THE MODEST SUCCESS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, SOME 40 MILLION AMERICANS CONTINUE TO HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE, WHILE EVEN MORE ARE UNDERINSURED WITH HEAVY COPAYMENTS OR DEDUCTIBLES. WE REMAIN THE ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE TO ITS PEOPLE HEALTH CARE AS A RIGHT, AND THAT IS A SHAME IN MY MIND. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE A LOT OF ANGRY PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. SOME OF THEM FROM THE OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT. SOME ARE IN THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT AND SEE THEMSELVES AS CONSERVATIVES. BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A HINT AS TO WHY WE ARE ANGRY AND WHY THEY ARE. SINCE 1999, THE TYPICAL MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY HAS SEEN ITS TAKE-HOME GO DOWN BY ALMOST $5,000 AFTER ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. THE MEDIAN MALE WORKER MADE $683 LESS LAST YEAR THEN HE DID 42 YEARS AGO. ARE WE BETTER OFF THAN WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE? OF COURSE WE ARE. BUT THE SUFFERING, ANXIETY THE MIDDLE CLASS FEELS TODAY HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS MY PERCEPTION ON CAPITOL HILL. THERE IS A WORLD HERE ON CAPITOL HILL THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM VERMONT AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND I THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE WE CLOSE THAT GAP AND BEGIN TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE WORKING FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY. MEANWHILE THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE AND THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS ARE DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL. THE GAP BETWEEN THE VERY, VERY RICH AND EVERYONE ELSE IS GROWING WIDER AND WIDER AND WIDER. THE TOP 1% NOW OWNS ABOUT 41% OF THE ENTIRE WEALTH OF THIS COUNTRY, WHILE THE BOTTOM 60% OWNS LESS THAN 2%. TODAY, INCREDIBLY THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%, 1/10 OF 1% NOW OWNS NEARLY AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. TODAY THE WALTON FAMILY, THE OWNER OF WALMART, IS NOW WORTH $157 BILLION. THAT IS MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 42% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE HAVE WITNESSED AN ENORMOUS TRANSFER OF WEALTH FROM THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS TO MULTI BILLIONAIRES. 90% WAS 36% IN 2013 WENT DOWN TO JUST 2.8%. -- JUST 22.8%. LISTEN TO THIS. IF THE BOTTOM 90% HAVE THE SAME SHARE OF ITS NATIONS WEALTH AS IT DID 30 YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE MORE THAN $10 TRILLION IN WEALTH THAN IS CURRENTLY THE CASE TODAY. MEANWHILE, THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS SHRUNK. THE PEOPLE ON TOP ARE DOING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. THE RICHEST 1/10 OF 1% HAVE INCREASED THEIR SHARE OF OUR NATIONS WEALTH BY MORE THAN $1 TRILLION OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES. IN TERMS OF INCOME AS OPPOSED TO WEALTH, SINCE THE GREAT WALL STREET COLLAPSE, 99% OF ALL NEW INCOME IS GOING TO THE TOP 1%. AS PEOPLE STRUGGLE AND WORRY HOW THEY WILL FEED THEIR KIDS IN SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE AND HOW THEY WILL DO CHILDCARE AND WORRY ABOUT THEIR PARENTS, 99% OF ALL NEW INCOME GENERATED IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS GOES TO THE TOP 10%. THE VERY RICH GET RICHER AND EVERYBODY ELSE GETS POORER. IN 2013, JUST AS AN EXAMPLE, THE TOP 25 HEDGE FUND MANAGERS MADE MORE THAN 24 BILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THAT THE FULL SALARIES OF MORE THAN 425,000 PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS. IS THAT WHAT AMERICA IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT? I DO NOT THINK SO. [APPLAUSE] BUT INCOME AND WEALTH EQUALITY -- ANY QUALITY IS NOT JUST A MORAL ISSUE. IT IS ALSO AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. MAYBE EVEN MORE PROFOUNDLY, IT IS A POLITICAL ISSUE. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MONEY ARE NOW PUTTING THEIR MONEY -- NOT PUTTING THEIR MONEY UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES. THEY ARE INVESTING HEAVILY IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. TO MAKE THE RICH EVEN RICHER. AS THE RESULT OF A DISASTROUS SUPREME COURT DECISION ON CITIZENS UNITED, BILLIONAIRE FAMILIES ARE NOW ABLE TO SPEND UNLIMITED SUMS OF MONEY TO PURCHASE THE CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS A HARSH STATEMENT, BUT IF ANYONE DOUBTS WHAT GOES ON IN CONGRESS, THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AFTER PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS NOT DONE ON BEHALF OF THE WEALTHY AND LARGE CORPORATIONS, LET ME RESPECTFULLY TELL YOU, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN WASHINGTON. ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, IT APPEARS THE KOCH BROTHERS ARE PREPARED TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN THE NEXT ELECTION THAN EITHER THE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN PARTY. IN OTHER WORDS, ONE FAMILY, THE SECOND WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY WORTH APPROXIMATELY $100 BILLION MAY WELL HAVE A STRONGER POLITICAL PRESCEEN THEN EITHER ONE OF THE MAJOR TWO PARTIES. HERE IS FROM A RECENT ARTICLE IN POLITICO. THE KOCH BROTHERS AND THEIR ALLIES ARE PUMPING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TWO DATA COMPANIES THAT ARE DEVELOPING DETAILED STATE-OF-THE-ART PROFILES ON 250 MILLION AMERICANS, GIVING THE BROTHERS POLITICAL OPERATION OR THE EARMARKS OF A MAC -- OF A NATIONAL PARTY. THEY ALSO HAVE DEVELOPED IN-HOUSE EXPERTISE IN POLLING, FACT CHECKING, ADVERTISING,MEDIA BUYING, AND NATIONALLY, AFTER YEARS OF PATIENT EXPERIMENTATION AND LIMITLESS CASH, THE OPERATION ACTUALLY EXCEEDS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S DOLLAR OPERATION IN MANY IMPORTANT RESPECTS. BECAUSE THEY HAD AN AND LISTEN SUPPLY OF MONEY, THE ONLY GET STRONGER. I WANT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM AND THOSE LISTENING TO THE PROGRAM TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH AL MEHAT ELU SEE. WH THE SECOND WEALTHIT FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY WITH AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING AGENDA AND A FEW OF THEIR BILLIONAIRE PALS HAVE MORE POLITICAL POWER THAN EITHER OF THE TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHAT IS THAT CLINICAL SYSTEM CALLED? I THINK IT SHOULD BCALLED BY ITS RIGHTFUL NAME. IT IS NOT CALLED DEMOCRACY. IT IS CALLED OLIGARCHY. THAT IS THE SYSTEM WE ARE RAPIDLY MOVING TOWARD. THAT IS THE SYSTEM WE MUST VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE EXCEEDED TIME. I ALWAYS GET PEOPLE IN LITTLE NERVOUS. IF I GO ON TOO LONG, YANK ME. I HAVE BEEN YANKED ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE. LET ME JUST TOUCH ON WHAT A PROGRESSIVE AGENDA LOOKS LIKE TO BEGIN TO ADJUST SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. LET'S NEVER FORGET TODAY, DESPITE THE IMPROVING ECONOMY, WE HAVE A MAJOR DRAWS IN INCOME PRICES. WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. I INTRODUCED ALONG WITH BARBARA -- BARBARA MIKULSKI A $1 TRILLION PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND WATER -- 13 MILLION -- AND SUPPORT THE CREATION OF 13 MILLION DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT JOBS AND INCOME, THE $7.25 MINIMUM WAGE HERE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, IT IS A STARVATION WAGE. WE NEED TO RAISE IT OVER A TIME OF YEARS TO $15 AN HOUR TO AN -- NO ONE WORKING 40 HOURS A WEEK IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD LIVE IN POVERTY. [APPLAUSE] DESPITE WHAT MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS MAY THINK, CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY, AND IT IS ALREADY CAUSING DEVASTATING HARM. WE HAVE GOT TO TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL TO ENERGY SUFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO PASS PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN WORKERS. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THEY ARE MAKING $.78 PER HOUR COMPARED TO MEN. IF WE ARE GOING TO SAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS OF THIS COUNTRY WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM OUR TRADE POLICIES. THEY ARE NOT WORKING. CORPORATE AMERICA WILL HAVE TO START INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES. NOT IN CHINA. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE GOT TO LEARN FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT INVESTING IN A HIGHER EDUCATION IS AN ASSET, IT IS A POSITIVE STEP. IT IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE THAT BILLIONS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GRADUATING SCHOOL DEEPLY IN DEBT AND MANY OTHERS CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE. THAT IS NOT THE WAY YOU CREATE A GREAT NATION. ANYONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY AND THE DESIRE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THE INCOME OF THEIR FAMILIES. [APPLAUSE] SIX, YOU CANNOT REGULATE WALL STREET. WALL STREET IS REGULATING THE CONGRESS. THE SIXTH LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAVE ASSETS OF ALMOST 60% OF OUR GDP. IF TEDDY ROOSEVELT WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, YOU KNOW WHAT HE WOULD SAY? BREAK THEM UP AND HE WOULD BE RIGHT. IT IS TIME TO BREAK UP THE LARGE WALL STREET BANK. [APPLAUSE] AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THE UNITED STATES REMAINS THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH WITHOUT A NATIONAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAM AND YET WE SPENT ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH PER CAPITA. IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD, AS A RIGHT OF CITIZENSHIP. [APPLAUSE] MY COLLEAGUES IN CONGRESS, SOME OF THEM ARE REPUBLICAN, WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO CUT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I STRONGLY DISAGREE. WE HAVE GOT TO EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY. NOT CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED REAL TAX REFORM. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT MAJOR CORPORATION AFTER MAJOR CORPORATION MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAYS NOTHING IN TAXES. WE LOSE $100 BILLION A YEAR IN REVENUE BECAUSE THEY STASH THEIR MONEY IN TAX HAVENS. IT IS TIME FOR THE LARGE CORPORATIONS TO REJOIN AMERICA AND START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. [APPLAUSE] SO LET ME THANK YOU AND MY FORGIVENESS FOR OVEREXTENDING MY TIME. WE ARE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT IS IMPERATIVE WE LEARN FROM THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, WHICH ACHIEVED SO MANY EXTRAORDINARY VICTORIES, THAT WE ORGANIZE, WE EDUCATE, AND WE BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO CREATE AN AMERICA THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US AND NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, WHEN WILL YOU DECLARE YOUR INTENTIONS OF 2016, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY ARE? >> THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. AND LET -- THE REASON I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SITTING HERE WITH MY WIFE WHO IS LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE IDEA, IT IS NOT BECAUSE I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY, I HAVE A BURNING DESIRE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I AM AS PROUD AS I COULD POSSIBLY BE TO BE REPRESENTING THE GREAT STATE OF VERMONT AND I HAVE REACHED A HIGHER LEVEL OF POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT I EVER DREAMED TO BE POSSIBLE. THE REASON I AM THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS THAT AT A TIME WHEN THE MIDDLE-CLASS OF THIS COUNTRY IS DISAPPEARING AND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GIVING UP ON THE POLITICAL PROCESS, -- LAST ELECTION, 63% DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO VOTE. WE NEED CANDIDATES WHO WILL STAND UP FOR THE WORKING-CLASS THIS COUNTRY. IT AIN'T AN EASY TASK. IT IS EASY TO GIVE A SPEECH, BUT WE ARE TAKING ON THE KOCH BROTHERS AND THE BILLIONAIRES AND WALL STREET AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. THAT IS NOT EASY STUFF. NOT EASY STUFF. I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS THING UNLESS I CAN DO IT WELL. CAN WE PUT TOGETHER THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PREPARED TO WORK HARD TO TAKE ON THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS? THAT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THERE IS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THESE IDEAS. MORE THAN I THINK THE INSIDE BELTWAY PUNDITS UNDERSTAND. CAN YOU CONVERT THAT INTO A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION? HOW DO YOU RAISE MONEY? I WOKE UP THE OTHER DAY AND SAID, I -- IF I WERE REALLY SUCCESSFUL AND DID SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED AND HAD 3 MILLION PEOPLE CONTRIBUTE $100 EACH, AND MY ELECTION CAMPAIGNS, I THINK THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION IS $45. NOT A LOT OF MONEY HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. I DO NOT DO THESE FUNDRAISERS FOR $100,000 EACH. I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS GOT THAT KIND OF MONEY. IF I WERE REALLY ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL AND HAD 3 MILLION PEOPLE CHECK -- CONTRIBUTING A HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH, 3 MILLION PEOPLE, THAT WOULD BE $300 MILLION, AN ENORMOUS SUM OF MONEY, ONE THIRD OF WHAT THE KOCH BROTHERS THEMSELVES WILL SPEND. SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES I AM TRYING TO WORK ON RIGHT NOW. >> YOU ARE AN INDEPENDENT AND YOU CAUCUS WITH THE DEMOCRATS. IF YOU RAN, WOULD YOU RUN AS A DEMOCRAT OR WOULD YOU RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT? >> GREAT QUESTION. AND I'M GETTING BOLDER AND BOLDER AND GRAYER AND GRAYER AND TRYING TO THINK THROUGH ALL OF THESE ISSUES. HERE'S THE STORY ON THAT IF YOU ONE. GO OUT AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ASK IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PARTY, THEY WILL TELL YOU IF -- THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS MOVED TO A RIGHT-WING WING EXTREMIST PARTY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ONCE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKING-CLASS, VERY FEW PEOPLE TO SEE IT WOULD BE THE CASE ANYMORE. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS ONE MIGHT RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT AND WHAT IS THE NEGATIVE? AS YOU ALL KNOW, IT IS AWFULLY HARD TO RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT IF YOU ARE NOT A BILLIONAIRE. I'M NOT A BILLIONAIRE. HOW DO YOU PUT TOGETHER A POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE? OUTSIDE OF THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM, HOW DO GET INVITED TO DEBATES ? WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE MEDIA, WILL THE MEDIA FOLLOW SOMEONE WHO IS AN INDEPENDENT NOT DEBATING? SOME PLACES, YOU CANNOT GET ON THE BALLOT AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE. THOSE ARE THE ISSUES WE ARE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH. >> WHAT MAKES YOU AN INDEPENDENT, GIVEN THAT YOU ALWAYS DO CAUCUS WITH DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AND WITH THE REPUBLICAN SENATE, ARE YOU FORCED TO VOTE WITH THE DEMOCRATS ANYWAY SO REPUBLICANS CANNOT GET THEIR AGENDA PASSED? THE QUESTION IS WHAT REALLY MAKES YOU AN INDEPENDENT? ARE YOU REALLY A DEMOCRAT? >> IF I STARTED IN MY DISCUSSION, MY FIRST VICTORY WAS DEFEATING A FIVE TERM DEMOCRAT AND I'VE DEFEATED DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IS WHAT I THINK. I THINK WE HAVE A POLITICAL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BECOME EXTREMELY RIGHT-WING. THIS IS NOT THE PARTY OF DAVID EISENHOWER. THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD CAUCUS WITH MP OR WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, YOU HAVE SOME GREAT PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE SOME REALLY, REALLY GOOD PEOPLE WHO OFTEN DO NOT GET THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE. MANY PROGRESSIVES OR SOME PROGRESSIVES IN THE SENATE WORKING NIGHT AND DAY FOR WORKING FAMILIES. FOR ME, GIVEN AS A MEMBER OF THE U.S. SENATE, THERE ARE TWO CAUCUSES, SO THERE IS NOT MUCH QUESTION ABOUT WHICH CAUCUS I WOULD BE IN. I WANT TO THINK HARRY REID AND THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE FOR TREATING ME VERY FAIRLY AND VERY DECENTLY. TO MY MIND, THERE IS NO QUESTION, THE DEMOCRATS ARE FAR PREFERABLE TO REPUBLICANS ON THE ISSUES I AM CONCERNED WITH. >> IF YOU RAN IT IF YOU WERE ELECTED, HOW WOULD YOU WORK WITH CONGRESS? THERE SEEMS TO BE A GRIDLOCK BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS NOW. WOULD THAT BE THE SAME CASE IF YOU WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE? >> THE REASON CONGRESS IS DYSFUNCTIONAL IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE SO-CALLED GRIDLOCK THAT EXISTS. IT IS NOT THAT EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS HAS A PERSONALITY DEFECT AND IS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE IN ANOTHER POLITICAL PARTY, OR THE PEOPLE END UP HATING EVERYBODY AROUND. IT IS JUST NOT THE CASE. THIS IS WHAT IS THE CASE. THE CASE IS, RIGHT NOW, THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. THEY ARE WAY OUT OF TOUCH. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY, RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. UNITED STATES CONGRESS SAYS, GIVE TAXPAYERS TO BILLIONAIRES. [LAUGHTER] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE TO MOVE TOWARD SUSTAINABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY AND ENERGY SUFFICIENCY. UNITED STATES CONGRESS SAYS, KILL THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. ON AND ON. YOU ASK ME A QUESTION, AND IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION PAIR I HAPPEN TO HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT AND PERSONAL AFFECTION FOR BARACK OBAMA. I THINK HISTORY WILL JUDGE HIM IN A LOT KINDER WAY THAN HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAVE. [APPLAUSE] I THINK THAT AS A POLITICIAN, HE HAS RUN CAMPAIGNS THAT WILL ALSO MAKE HISTORY BOOKS. NOT TELL YOU ANY SECRETS, WHAT THE MAJOR MISTAKE HAS BEEN IS THAT HE THOUGHT AFTER PUTTING TOGETHER THIS EXTRAORDINARY, GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE, MINORITIES, WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE, PUTTING TOGETHER A COALITION AND GETTING ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY, AND THEN HE THOUGHT HE COULD SIT DOWN WITH REPUBLICANS AND NEGOTIATE ALL OF THESE FINE AGREEMENTS, HE WAS MISTAKEN. THE ONLY WAY ANY PRESIDENT IN THIS DAY AND AGE TAKING ON THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS CAN SUCCEED, THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY, IS TO MOBILIZE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO SAY TO CONGRESS, GUESS WHAT. THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING. YOU ARE GOING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS. YOU ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR VETERANS AND OUR SENIORS. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO THE RICH. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. WE ARE WATCHING YOU. IF YOU DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS LEGISLATION, YOU WILL NOT RETURN TO OFFICE. WHAT I WILL SAY WITH 100% CERTAINTY, THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ELECTIONS IN WHICH 63% OF THE PEOPLE DO NOT VOTE, 80% OF YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T VOTE, THEN THE RICH WILL ONLY GET RICHER AND WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE WHAT GOES ON HERE IN WASHINGTON. ANY SERIOUS PRESIDENT THAT WANTS TO REPRESENT WORKING FAMILIES HAS TO MOBILIZE PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE THE CONGRESS AN OFFER THEY CANNOT REFUSE. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW WILL YOUR DECISION RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BE AFFECTED BY WHAT OTHERS DO? SECRETARY CLINTON, IF SHE GETS IN THE RACE AND DEPENDING ON WHAT SHE DOES OR SAYS, IF SHE GOES TO WALL STREET AND COMES OUT VERY STRONG AGAINST WALL STREET, OR IF SENATOR WARREN OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT GOT IN, WITH THAT AFFECT YOUR DECISION TO GET IN OR GET OUT? >> I DO POLITICS. PEOPLE IN VERMONT UNDERSTAND THIS. YOU ARE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY WHO HAS RUN IN MANY ELECTIONS. IN THE HOUSE FOR 16 YEARS, EIGHT ELECTIONS. IN THE SENATE TWICE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY NEGATIVE ADS I HAVE RUN DURING THOSE YEARS? NOT ONE. I NEVER RAN A NEGATIVE AD. SO I DON'T RUN AGAINST PEOPLE. IT'S NOT MY DESIRE TO TRASH PEOPLE. HILLARY CLINTON IS A REMARKABLE WOMAN WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY OF PUBLIC SERVICE. IT WOULD NOT BE MY JOB TO RUN AGAINST THEM. IT WOULD BE MY JOB, IF SHE RAN AND IF I RAN, TO DEBATE THE SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY AS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING IN A DEMOCRACY. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS HOW I ALWAYS GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE AND I AM GETTING MY WIFE NERVOUS ALREADY. WE CAN'T HAVE THAT SERIOUS DEBATE IF THE MEDIA DOESN'T ALLOW IT. SO I WOULD URGE MY MEDIA FRIENDS, THAT INSTEAD OF POLITICAL GOSSIP, LET US TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES AND RESPECT DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. HIM BUT WHEN 63% OF THE PEOPLE IN A POLL LAST YEAR DIDN'T KNOW WHICH POLITICAL PARTIES CONTROLLED THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN THIS COUNTRY. SO WHAT WE NEED IS CIVIL, INTELLIGENT DEBATES ON THE REAL ISSUES FACING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOT MORE POLITICAL GOSSIP OF, ""WHO'S WINNING TODAY AND WHO'S LOSING? WHO SLIPPED ON A BANANA PEEL? WHO SAID SOMETHING PARTICULARLY STUPID?"" I'M SURE I DID TODAY. BUT LET IT BE -- ""HOW DO WE REBUILD A CRUMBLING MIDDLE CLASS? HOW DO WE LEAD THE WORLD IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM SO WE CAN SAVE THE PLANET FROM CLIMATE CHANGE? HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY?"" NOT EASY STUFF. HOW DO WE DO IT? THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT SERIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] >> I HAD READ THAT YOU WERE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT SECRETARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS. I WONDER IF YOU VIEW THAT AS A TOTAL TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT, OR ARE THERE REAL TRANSPARENCY ISSUES ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT OPERATES AT THE CORE OF THIS THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF SHOULD TALK ABOUT? SENATOR SANDERS: THE FRUSTRATION IS OUT OF ALL OF THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN IN CONGRESS, NOT ONE PERSON IN THE MEDIA CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, BERNIE, WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY IN THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD, WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT? BERNIE, WE HAVE 11% OF OUR PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED TODAY. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THOSE PEOPLE BACK TO WORK? BERNIE, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT SO FEW PEOPLE HAVE SO MUCH POLITICAL POWER? WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT THAT? THOSE ARE QUESTIONS I DO NOT HEAR VERY MUCH ABOUT. I DO NOT KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT. I KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS ABOUT THE E-MAILS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE, BUT FRANKLY, FROM THE CALLS, JUST MENTIONED, I ASKED AT THE FRONT DESK, HOW MANY CALLS ARE WE GETTING ABOUT HILLARY'S E-MAIL? IN WASHINGTON D.C., ZERO. >> HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS PRESIDENT AND WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE PUSH THE REPUBLICANS TO HAVE THE FED AUDITED? SENATOR SANDERS: AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. WHEN I WAS INVOLVED IN DODD FRANK, A MAJOR PIECE OF FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, WE MANAGED TO GET AN AMENDMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT DID NOT AUDIT THE FED IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT DID AUDIT THE FED DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. BOY, BLOOMBERG WAS ACTIVE IN THAT EFFORT AS WELL. I THINK THEY BROUGHT FORTH A LAWSUIT. WHAT WE FOUND OUT WAS THAT DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, $16 TRILLION IN ZERO OR LOW INTEREST LOANS, WAS LED OUT OF VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND CENTRAL-BANK ALL OVER THE WORLD. $16 TRILLION, ZERO OR LOW INTEREST LOANS. IN A REVOLVING LOAN FUND. AND YET, WORKING FAMILIES TODAY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY WILL PAY 7% TO 8% INTEREST RATES. IN TERMS OF AUDITING THE FED, THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, TOGETHER, RON PAUL AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON THAT LEGISLATION, WHICH WE MANAGED TO PASS SOME OF IT IN THE BILL. THE IDEA OF AUDITING THE FED DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME. >> SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT WAR AND DEFENSE WE ARE RUNNING SHORT ON TIME. WE'RE TRYING TO COMBINE A FEW OF THEM AND YOU WILL JUMP IN. YOU HAVE OPPOSED THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT, HOW WOULD YOU HAVE RESPONDED TO THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001? THAT IS ONE QUESTION. ANOTHER QUESTIONER NOTES YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE OF CUTTING DEFENSE SPENDING, AND YET THIS PERSON ALSO BELIEVES YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF THE F 35 PROGRAM, WHICH HAS COME UNDER A LOT OF CRITICISM IS BEING WASTEFUL. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT? F 35 AND SEPTEMBER 11. SENATOR SANDERS: I VOTED FOR THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN. THE REASON I DID THIS BECAUSE WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO LED THE ATTACK ON 9/11. OSAMA BIN LADEN HE WAS BEING HARBORED IN AFGHANISTAN AND THEY REFUSED TO GIVE HIM UP AND I SUPPORTED OUR TROOPS GOING IN THERE. I DID NOT THEN KNOW THAT THE WAR WOULD GO ON AND ON AND ON. THAT, I DID NOT KNOW. I STRONGLY OPPOSED THE WAR IN IRAQ AND I THINK HISTORY WILL CALL THAT THE RIGHT VOTE. HOW YOU DEAL WITH ISIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE. NONE OF THESE ISSUES ARE SIMPLE. ANYONE WHO JUMPS UP AND THINKS THEY HAVE A MAGICAL SOLUTION IS USUALLY VERY WRONG. THIS IS WHAT MY FEAR IS. WE HAVE BEEN IN WAR IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN FOR OVER A DECADE. THE COST OF THAT WAR AND HUMAN LIFE AND SUFFERING AND FINANCIALLY HAS BEEN VERY HEAVY. I STRONGLY FEEL THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE HELL-BENT IN GETTING US INVOLVED IN NEVER ENDING WAR IN THE QUAGMIRE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. I WILL DO MY BEST TO OPPOSE THAT. RIGHT NOW, WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SITUATION WHERE, AS AN EXAMPLE, SAUDI ARABIA, SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW, IS A COUNTRY CONTROLLED BY MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR FAMILY, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST FAMILIES IN THE WORLD. IT TURNS OUT SAUDI ARABIA HAS THE FOURTH LARGEST MILITARY BUDGET IN THE WORLD. NOW WHY IN GOD'S NAME IS THE UNITED STATES CONTEMPLATING SENDING COMBAT TROOPS INTO IRAQ AGAIN, WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THE SAUDIS SITTING THERE, WATCHING US DO THAT? WHAT YOU HAVE NOW THE MIDDLE EAST IS IN FACT A WAR FOR THE SOUL OF ISLAM. WHAT WILL ISLAM BE? WILL IT BE THE PEACEFUL RELIGION MANY BELIEVE IT TO BE, OR WILL IT BE ISIS INFORM? IT IS INCUMBENT FOR SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, FOR JORDAN, FOR THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, TO GET ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THAT EFFORT AGAINST ISIS. I THINK UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR EFFORTS. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES SHOULD LEAD THAT EFFORT. [APPLAUSE] >> WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME. BEFORE I ASK THE LAST QUESTION, I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS TO TAKE CARE OF. I FIRST WANT TO REMIND YOU ABOUT UPCOMING SPEAKERS. FDA COMMISSIONER MARGARET HAMBURG WILL BE HERE ON MARCH 27. AND THE CHIEF INTERNET EVANGELIST FOR GOOGLE WILL BE HERE ON MAY 4. SECOND, I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT OUR GUEST WITH THE TRADITIONAL NATIONAL PRESS CLUB MUG, WHICH IS REALLY A NICER AND MORE VALUABLE GIFT THAN ANYTHING YOU WOULD GET AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, LET ME TELL YOU. [LAUGHTER] SENATOR SANDERS: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> LAST QUESTION, BEN AND JERRY PERIODICALLY RETIRES ITS FLAVORS. AS A POWERFUL POLITICAL PERSONAGE, WHAT FLAVOR WOULD YOU USE YOUR CONSIDERABLE CLOUT TO SAVE IF IT EVER GOT PUT ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK? [LAUGHTER] SENATOR SANDERS: BEN AND JERRY ARE GOOD FRIENDS. THEY HAVE STOPPED EATING A LOT OF THAT ICE CREAM AND THEN IS A LOT SKINNIER THAN HE USED TO BE. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE PRESS CLUB STAFF FOR ORGANIZING TODAY'S EVENTS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE A COPY OF TODAY'S PROGRAM, OR TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, GO TO OUR WEBSITE, PRESS.ORG. THANK YOU AND WE ARE ADJOURNED. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR SANDERS: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> ANOTHER PICTURE.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?202719-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"THANK YOU. CONNIE IS RIGHT, I AM BOB KERRY AND AS TOM HARKIN WAS ALWAYS FOND OF SAYING I'M FROM ACROSS THE RIVER. BUT I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU WITH MANY VERY GOOD MEMORIES OF IOWA. I REMEMBER TRAVELING ACROSS THE RIVER WITH MY MOTHER AND FATHER AND FAMILY TO ATTENDS TO FAMILY REUNIONS WITH MY MOTHER'S FAMILY. I REMEMBER VISITING DEMINUTE, QUAD CITIES, WORKING ON MY FATHER'S FARM. MY UNCLE RAISED TURKEYS. IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF HAVING AN AUDIENCE APPLAUD WHAT I SAID. VERY EASY TO GET TURKEYS TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY. I HAD MY FIRST JOB IN OTTAWA. I RECEIVED MY LETTER FROM THE SELECTIVE SERVICE WHEN I WAS WORKING IN SIOUX CITY, IOWA. I REMEMBER WORKING WITH THE MAYOR OF OMAHA ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. I REMEMBER CAMPAIGNING WITH TOM HARKIN AND HIM COMING ACROSS THE RIVER TO CAMPAIGN FOR ME. I REMEMBER WORKING IN THE SENATE ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES WHERE THERE'S A COMMON BOND BETWEEN NEBRASKA AND IOWA, THE MISSOURI RIVER, HEALTH, TRANSPORTATION, EDUCATION, WHERE NEBRASKA AND IOWA HAVE COMMON BONDS. SO I SHARE A LOT OF MEMORIES OF IOWA, AND I SHARE A LOT OF VALUE WITH THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AS WELL. IT IS WHY I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD TO BE HERE IN COUNCIL BLUFS, IOWA TO ENDORSE THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY OF SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON. [ APPLAUSE ] BORROWING AS I SOMETIMES DO FROM THE WORDS OF OTHERS, THIS TIME THE WORDS OF THIS MORNING'S DES MOINES REGISTER EDITORIAL, HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTAND THE CHANGE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IS NEEDED. BUILT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, SHE HAS THE SKILLS AND THE DISCIPLINE TO MAKE THAT CHANGE HAPPEN. [ APPLAUSE ] SHE HAS ALWAYS DONE, SHE WILL THROW HERSELF INTO THE JOB. SHE WILL LEAD WITH DEMOCRATIC VALUES BUT WORK WITH REPUBLICANS TO SOLVE THE GROWING LIST OF PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE AS A NATION. SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON THROUGH HER WORK, HER EXPERIENCE, HER VALUES AND DETERMINATION, KEEP UP THE FIGHT TO THE MOST DAUNTING CHALLENGES ANY POLITICAL LEADER HAS FACED THESE PAST TWO DECADES. HAS INSPIRED MY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO SURVIVE THE RIGORS, THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN. SHE HAS BEEN STANDING UP TO THE EXTREME WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS WHILE THEY TRIED TO TEAR HER DOWN AND, YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE'S STILL STANDING. [ APPLAUSE ] SHE HAS INSPIRED MY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO SECURE THE SUPPORT OF RED AND BLUE STATE VOTERS THAT SHE WILL NEED TO ACHIEVE THE 270 ELECTORAL VOTES THAT WILL MAKE HER PRESIDENT-ELECT LESS THAN SEVEN MONTHS FROM NOW. AND THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THAT IS HER 2006 SENATE RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WHEN SHE WON 52 OUT OF 58 COUNTY, INCLUDING MANY TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN COUNTIES. THAT'S WHY SHE'S EARNED THE CONFIDENCE AND SUPPORT OF POLITICAL LEADERS OF RED STATES, INDIANA SENATOR HE VOON BYE, OHIO GOVERNOR AND ARKANSAS GOVERNOR. SHE'S INSPIFRD EXPIRED -- SHE'S INSPIRED MY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE WILL BE A RELIABLE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. THAT SHE CAN BUILD A BIPARTISAN POLICY TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. THAT SHE WILL FIND AN HONORABLE WAY OUT OF IRAQ AND A MORE SUSTAINABLE SUCCESS IN AVERAGE. SHE WILL INSIST WE REBUILD OUR OVERSTRESSED MILITARY WITHOUT FALLING FOR EXPENSIVE SYSTEMS WE DON'T NEED OR EQUIPMENT THAT DOES NOT WORK. [ APPLAUSE ] SHE HAS INSPIRED MY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE, THE VISION, AND THE FORTITUDE TO TAKES TO NEGOTIATE WITH WORLD LEADERS TO SOLVE GLOBAL PROBLEMS OF TERRORISM, NUCLEAR PROLIE FERRY AGES, ETHNIC HATRED, HIV AIDS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. SHE'S INSPIRED -- SHE HAS INSPIRED MY CONFIDENCE THAT WE MUST NEGOTIATE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. [ APPLAUSE ] SHE HAS INSPIRED MY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE WILL URGE CONGRESS TO USE THE LAW TO HARNESS THE FORCES OF THE MARKET AND GLOBALISM SO ALL AMERICANS SECURE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. [ APPLAUSE ] SO THAT ALL AMERICANS HAVE CONFIDENCE AND SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE PROTECTED AND INCREASE PAIR PERSONAL SAVINGS AND WEALTH. SO THAT ALL AMERICANS KNOW THEY ARE SAFE WHEN THEY PURCHASE CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM ABROAD AND THAT THE AMERICAN'S DREAM OF A GOOD JOB, A HOME TO CALL YOUR OWN AND A COLLEGE EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILDREN WILL COME ALIVE AGAIN IN THE HEARTS OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. [ APPLAUSE ] SHE HAS INSPIRED MY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE WILL NOMINATE TO THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT WILL CONTINUE THE 220 HEAR HEROIC EFFORT TO EXPAND THE LEGAL CIRCLE OF FREEDOM FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. [ APPLAUSE ] SENATOR CLINTON INSPIRES MY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE WILL BE THE LEADER WE NEED AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY. FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TODAY IS, BY THE WAY, NOT WHETHER SHE INSPIRES ME. THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TODAY IS DOES SHE INSPIRE YOUR CONFIDENCE TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? [ APPLAUSE ] WELL THEN THE REST IS UP TO YOU. YOU CANNOT LET RAIN OR SLEET OR HAIL OR SNOW KEEP YOU FROM THE IOWA CAUCUSES ON JANUARY 3RD. YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW UP. YOU GOT TO EMAIL. YOU GOT TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HILLARY CLINTON, THAT YOU CAN GO TO WASHINGTON TO RESTORE OUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS GOVERNMENT OF, BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE. [ APPLAUSE ] SO, PLEASE DON'T LET US DOWN. WE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE IOWANS ARE COUNTING ON YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT HILLARY IS COUNTING ON ME TO STOP TALKING AND FINISH THIS INTRODUCTION. AND SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND PRIDE THAT I GIVE YOU MY SENATOR AND SOON I PRAY OUR PRESIDENT, SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THAMBG YOU. THANK YOU ALL. WOW. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE BACK IN COUNCIL BLUFFS WITH ALL OF YOU, ESPECIALLY WITH FRIENDS LIKE CONNIE AND HER DAUGHTER KATE AND HER HUSBAND MIKE. CONNIE IS A GREAT LEADER OF MY CAMPAIGN. BOTH SHE AND KATE HAVE JUST BEEN DEVOTED AND WORKING HARD. I'M SURE THEY HAVE HARRAH'SED A LOT OF YOU TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM THAT WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER. AND I ALSO AM ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED PERSONALLY TO HAVE MY FRIEND OF 25 YEARS, BOB KERREY ENDORSE ME WITH SUCH A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. YOU KNOW, AS CONNIE SAID, BOB HAS GIVEN A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. HE HAS LITERALLY BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE, FIGHTING AND STANDING UP AND ADVOCATING FOR THE VALUES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REALLY AT THE ROOT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THIS GREAT COUNTRY'S JOURNEY TOWARDS PROGRESS. I ALSO WANT TO ADD IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HE HAS DONE, HE SERVED WITH GREAT DISTINCTION ON THE 9/11 COMMISSION. THAT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO THOSE OF US IN NEW YORK TO TRY TO GET TO THE TRUTH, TO TRY TO HOLD PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE. AND BOB AND I HAVE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN AMERICA TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SAFE, TO DETER AND DEFEAT TERRORISM, AND TO MAKE OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE. BOB KERREY IS THE EMBODIMENT OF PATRIOTISM IN ACTION AND IT'S A TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE WITH HIM, BACK ACROSS THE RIVER FROM NEBRASKA WHERE HE SERVED WITH DISTINCTION AS HE SETS FORTH THE REASONS FOR HIS SUPPORT OF MY CANDIDACY, HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT COURAGE AND LEADERSHIP AND HE HAS EXPERIENCE IN TOUGH FIGHTS. SO I'M THRILLED TO HAVE HIM ON MY TEAM. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH, BOB. [ APPLAUSE ] WE ARE KICKING OFF TODAY OUR EVERY COUNTY COUNT TOUR RIGHT HERE IN COUNSEL -- COUNCIL BLUFFS. [ APPLAUSE ] OVER THE NEXT FIVE DAYS I AND MY FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WILL BLANKET IOWA. WE'LL BE IN ALL 99 COUNTIES. WE'RE GOING TO BE -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- KNOCKING ON DOORS AND MAKING PHONE CALLS. VISITING PEOPLE'S HOMES, THEIR PLACES OF WORK. ALL WITH A VERY SIMPLE BUT URGENT MESSAGE. THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT BEGINS HERE IN IOWA. IOWA JUANS HAVE AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP US FIGURE OUT WHO WILL BE THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, THAT'S IMPORTANT, BUT EVEN MORE SO WHO IS READY TO BE PRESIDENT. AND WHO IS READY, WILLING AND ABLE ON DAY ONE TO DO THE JOB THAT WE NEED DONE. SO, I'M EXCITED ABOUT OUR 99 COUNTY BLITZ. I'M ACTUALLY EVEN GOING TO GET IN A HELICOPTER AFTER I LEAVE YOU. WE'RE CALLING IT A HILICOPTER AND WE CAN COVER MORE GROUND THAT WAY. I HAVE FRIENDS OF A LIFETIME WHO HAVE COME TO IOWA TO HELP ME, INCLUDING MY BEST FRIENDS FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OF WHOM I'M VERY CLOSE. PEOPLE I WORKED WITH IN ARKANSAS, NEW YORK, ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I'M THRILLED TO INTRODUCE THEM TO IOWA AND HAVE SO MANY IOWA JUANWAYIANS HERE THEIR STORY. I WAS ESPECIALLY HONORED BY THE ENDORSEMENT THIS MORNING OF MY CANDIDACY BY THE DES MOINES REGISTER. [ APPLAUSE ] IT WAS AN IMPORTANT EVENT IN THIS PROCESS. AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY HAVE ZEROED IN ON THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE NEXT PRESIDENT, BY MY VISION FOR OUR COUNTRY, MY PLANS FOR CHANGE, AND MY ABILITY TO LEAD. NOW WITH BOB KERREY'S ENDORSEMENT WITH CONGRESSMAN BOB'S ENDORSEMEN OUR CANDIDACY IS ENERGIZED WE PICKED UP MOMENTUM AND WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY TO JANUARY 3RD WITH YOUR HELP. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, I CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT GROWING, AND IT REALLY SPANS ALL AGES. I WAS TALKING TO AN IOWAN ON THE PHONE AS I WAS DRIVING FROM THE AIRPORT TO COME HERE AND HE TOLD ME THAT HIS DAUGHTER IS TURNING 18 BEFORE THE CAUCUSES. THEY LIVE IN DES MOINES AND SHE'S GOING CAUCUS FOR ME. THEN I GOT A REPORT THAT A 102-YEAR-OLD MAN IS ALSO GOING TO CAUCUS FOR ME. [ APPLAUSE ] AND SO WE ARE APPEALING TO EVERY GENERATION. AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. BECAUSE WE NEED EVERYBODY IN AMERICA COMMITTED TO THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE TOGETHER. IT IS INSPIRING TO ME THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR 90s AND NOW IN THEIR SECOND CENTURY WOULD CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THE FUTURE TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? NO MATTER HOW INCONVENIENT IT IS, HOW DIFFICULT IT MIGHT BE, REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER, I WANT TO BE THERE. TO STAND UP FOR HILLARY CLINTON. AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHOSE WHOLE LIVES ARE BEFORE THEM, UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. SO I COULD NOT BE MORE PUMPED UP. I'M THRILLED AT THE FAST AND GROWING SUPPORT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE. BUT AS BOB KERREY SAID WE HAVE TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO ACTION ON JANUARY 3RD AND I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU THE CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY, BECAUSE AS I ALSO AM REACHING OUT AND MEETING WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND TRAVELING ALL THOSE MILES, I HAVE TO RELY ON ALL OF YOU THE WAY I RELY ON CONNIE AND KATE TO BE MY EYES, MY EARS, REALLY TO SPEAK FOR ME. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL IMPRESS UPON PEOPLE WHAT A CRITICAL ELECTION THIS IS AND THAT I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT BASED ON MY 35 YEARS OF WORK. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED, MY COMMITMENT TO APPLY THE PERSISTENCE, THE PERSEVERANCE AND YES THE PERSPIRATION TO GET IT DONE. BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA DEA. I GREW UP IN A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO. RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDWEST. MY FATHER CAME HOME AFTER SERVING IN THE NAVY FOR FIVE YEARS AND HE WANTED TO DO THREE THINGS. HE WANTED TO START A SMALL BUSINESS. HE WANTED TO START A FAMILY. AND HE WANTED TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A HOUSE. AND MY MOTHER WHO DIDN'T HAVE A VERY EASY UPBRINGING, SHE WANTED TO GIVE HOME RUN CHILDREN SOMETHING SHE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO DO AND THAT WAS TO GO TO COLLEGE. SO WE LIVED THE MIDDLE CLASS VALUE. WE UNDERSTOOD AS MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME THAT WE HAD TO WORK HARD, BE SELF-RELIANT, BE RESILIENT BUT ALSO TO BE COMPASSIONATE AND CARING, TO BE PART OF THE LARGER COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN, PARTICULARLY EVERY CHILD A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD GIVEN POTENTIAL. WELL, MY 88-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, GOD BLESS HER STILL LIVES WITH ME. I BROUGHT HER OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN FROM THE MEDIA, AND SHE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE DECIDED SHE MIGHT DO A LITTLE MORE OF THAT IF SHE HAD ENOUGH REST IN BETWEEN STOPS. BUT AS WE TRAVELED AROUND, IT WAS A GREAT REMINDER TO ME OF THE COMMITMENT I FEEL TO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN THE TWILIGHT OF THEIR YEARS AND THOSE WHO ARE AT THE VERY DAWN OF THEIR LIVES ALL HAVE A CHANCE TO PURSUE THAT AMERICAN DREAM THAT HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO ALL OF US. AND SO I RUN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES IN AMERICA TODAY AND CERTAINLY HERE END IOWA WHOM I'VE MET, THEY HAVE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE THEIR STORIES AND CONCERNS WITH ME, AND THEY ARE WORRIED. THEY FEEL ANXIOUS AND INSECURE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER LIFE WELL BE BETTER FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. THEY ASK THEMSELVES EVERY DAY WHY IS IT NO ONE SEEMS TO NOTICE THAT I'M WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN AND I'M NOT GETTING AHEAD. THAT I DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR MYSELF OR MY CHILDREN. THAT MY JOB HAS BEEN OUTSOURCED AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO GO TO GET ANOTHER ONE. THESE ARE THE REAL LIFE CONCERNS THAT IOWANS HAVE SHARED WITH ME OVER THE PAST 11 MONTHS AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY INVISIBLE AMERICANS WHEN I'M PRESIDENT. EVERY ONE WILL BE SEEN -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- RESPECTED, HEARD. AND JUST AS I'M SAYING THAT EVERY COUNTY COUNTS IN ME CAMPAIGN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO COUNT ON ME WHEN I'M YOUR PRESIDENT. I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY, THINKING ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO THAT DAY TO MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER, TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY FAIRER, TO RESTORE SHARED PROSPERITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, TO RESTORE OUR MORAL AUTHORITY AROUND THE WORLD, TEEN GIVE AMERICANS BACK OUR PRIDE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE SO VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF GEORGE BUSH, AMERICA IS READY FOR CHANGE. WE ARE READY FOR A NEW BEGINNING. [ APPLAUSE ] NOW, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ONE QUESTION. WHO IS READY AND ABLE TO MAKE THE CHANGES WE NEED STARTING ON DAY ONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE? WELL, SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT. SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY HOPING FOR IT. I BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY WORKING HARD FOR IT. AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE ALL MY LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE REAL CHANGE IN THE LIVES OF THE REAL PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND CARE ABOUT. THAT I HAVE FOUGHT FOR FOR 35 YEARS. NOW, THAT HARD WORK DEMANDS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND WHEN TO FIND COMMON GROUND. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE TOO UNYIELDING, YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING DONE. NOT IN AMERICA. WE'RE NOT A DICTATOR SHIPP. YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU DON'T STAND UP AND REFUSE TO COMPROMISE ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT, THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD LOSE OUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE. SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BALANCE IT, HOW TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND. FOR 35 YEARS I'VE BEEN A CHANGE MAKER AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HOPE TO DO FOR ALL OF YOU AND FOR EVERY AMERICAN. NOW, FOR ME THAT MEANS THAT I STARTED WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL NOT GOING TO WORK FOR A BIG CORPORATE LAW FIRM BUT GOING TO WORK CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. I DID THAT BECAUSE I WATCHED AND LEARNED ABOUT MY MOTHER'S LIFE, THE FACT THAT SHE HAD TO GO TO WORK AS A MOTHER'S HELPER WHEN SHE WAS 13. AND IT WAS HARD. AND I BELIEVE THAT KIDS SHOULD BE GIVEN A BETTER SHOT THAN THAT. THAT A LOT OF KIDS DRAW THE SHORT STRAW IN LIFE. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WORKED ON WAS GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE MISSING CHILDREN WERE. MISSING NOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD KIDNAPPED THEM BUT MISSING BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN SCHOOL. YOU SEE, BACKITARIANLY 1970s YOU COULD LOOK AT THE CENSUS FIGURES ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT LIVED IN A PARTICULAR AREA, LOOK AT SCHOOL ENROLLMENT FIGURES AND THERE WERE CHILDREN IN THE AREA WHO WESTERN IN SCHOOL AND NOBODY COULD FIGURE OUT WHY. BUT I FOUND OUT WHY. I FOUND CHILDREN WERE BLIND. CHILDREN WHO WERE DEAF. CHILDREN IN WHEELCHAIRS. CHILDREN WITH OTHER KINDS OF DISABILITIES. THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THEM IN A BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL LIKE THIS. SO I WORKED WITH MANY OTHERS TO CHANGE THE LAWS, TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES TO GET A EDUCATION. AND HE WAS PROUD TO BE PART OF MAKING CHANGE THAT HELPED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, IN ARKANSAS I WORKED TO EXPAND WORLD HEALTH CARE INTO SOME OF THE POOREST PLACES IN THE STATE AND I WORKED TO REFORM SCHOOLS SO THAT IF YOU WERE A POOR CHILD LIVING A REALLY POOR AREA OF YARK, YOU OFTEN WOULD GO TO SCHOOL THAT DIDN'T HAVE ADVANCED MATH OR CHEMISTRY, DIDN'T HAVE FOREIGN LANGUAGES, SO NO MATTER HOW TALENTED URINE, NO MATTER HOW HARD-WORKING YOU WERE WILLING TO BE, YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR A FIRST CLASS EDUCATION. SO WE CHANGED THAT. WE CHANGED THE STANDARDS. WE IMPROVED EDUCATION AND INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST REFORMS IN THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE YOU SEE I KNEW THAT TO MAKE CHANGE YOU HAD TO WORK WITH PEOPLE, TO RAISE TEACHER SALARIES AND EXPAND THE CURRICULUM SO THAT THOUSANDS OF ARKANSAS STUDENTS NOW HAVE AN EDUCATION THAT WAS DENIED TO PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AND I'M PROUD THAT I WAS PART OF MAKING THOSE CHANGES AS WELL. AND AS I CONTINUE TO WORK, I CHAIRED THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION TO MAKE SURE THAT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDERSTAND LAW WASN'T SOME CRUEL HOAX IN AMERICA. IF YOU WERE POOR YOU HAD A LEGITIMATE LEGAL PROBLEM YOU WOULD HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WOULD GIVE YOU YOUR DAY IN COURT. AND I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT I COULD IN 1993 WORK WITH A LOT OF VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE TO TRY TO BRING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE TO OUR COUNTRY. NOW WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL BUT I'M VERY PROUD THAT WE TRIED. BUT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, I TRAVELED TO BEIJING AS FIRST LADY ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU TO STAND UP FOR A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS REMEMBER WOMEN'S RIGHTS. IT'S NOT ONLY WHAT WE BELIEVE HERE IN OUR COUNTRY, IT'S WHAT WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. COUNTRIES THAT DENY WOMEN THEIR RIGHTS ARE 0 OFTEN COUNTRIES THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH, AREN'T THEY? SO WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR AMERICAN VALUES AND MAKE SURE THOSE VALUES ARE HEARD AROUND THE WORLD AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CHANGES ON BEHALF OF WOMEN THAT ARE GOOD AN RIGHT FOR WOMEN AND SMART FOR AMERICA'S SECURITY. [ APPLAUSE ] I WROTE A BOOK CALLED ""IT TAKES A VILLAGE"" BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE HOW WE CAN BUILD A BETTER COUNTRY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND I WAS PLEASED TO TURN ALL OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THAT BOOK, OVER A MILLION DOLLARS TO CHILDREN'S CHARITIES. IT'S NOT WHAT WE DO IN OUR GOVERNMENT THAT COUNTS IT'S WHAT WE DO IN OUR DAILY LIVES, HOW WE SUPPORT CHARITABLE ENTERPRISES THAT ARE THERE WITH A HELPING HAND FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. I WANT AS PRESIDENT TO INSPIRE MORE PHILANTHROPY, TO GET MORE AMERICANS INVOLVED IN HELPING THEIR NEIGHBORS. THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH WORK TO DO AND WE WANT TO HARNESS WHAT IS REALLY THE GENIUS OF OUR COUNTRY, THE WILLINGNESS OF OUR CITIZENS TO GIVE OF THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL FOR HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE I DIDN'T GIVE UP. I SOMETIMES YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT A PERSON WHEN YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO AFTER THEY DON'T SUCCEED AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY SUCCEEDED BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE WHO PULL THEMSELVES UP. WHO GET UP AND KEEP GOING. THAT'S WHAT I DID WHEN I HELPED TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. WE HAVE SEEN THAT PROGRAM OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF KIDS. AND NOW GEORGE BUSH HAS VETOED OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND IT. I TELL YOU WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT WE'RE GOING EXPAND HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CHILD. [ APPLAUSE ] AND IN THE SENATE I HAVE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO MAKE CHANGE. WHEN I WAS ELECTED THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TOOK A CHANCE ON ME. IT WAS A GREAT HONOR THAT THEY DID. BUT I KNEW THAT I HAD TO GO AND GET THINGS DONE. I COULDN'T JUST SAY WELL I'VE BEEN ELECTED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THAT'S NOT WHO I AM, THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO. SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WORK, EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR RURAL AREAS FOR OUR FARMERS AND OUR SMALL TOWNS. WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE WITH REPUBLICANS TO GET HEALTH CARE FOR OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT. WORKING TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A NATIONAL EMERGENCY SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN YOU HIT 911 ON YOUR CELL PHONE SOMEBODY WOULD KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES WE HAVE IN PHILOSOPHY OR IDEOLOGY WE CAN'T LET PARTISAN SHIP STAND IN THE WAY OF THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. AND I LOOK FORWARD, I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS TO CREATE A NEW BEGINNING FOR AMERICA. THAT NEW BEGINNING WILL ONCE AND FOR ALL GIVE US UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. EVERY DAY PEOPLE COME UP TO ME WITH THEIR PROBLEMS. THEY TELL ME HORROR STORIES ABOUT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT REJECT THEIR CLAIMS. ABOUT PREMIUMS GOING UP SO FAST AND HIGH THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. ABOUT BEING WITHOUT INSURANCE. NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE TREATMENTS THAT THEIR DOCTORS SAY ARE NEEDED. I LISTEN TO SO MANY OF THESE STORIES AND IT JUST STRENGTHS MY RESOLVE THAT WE WILL PUT TOGETHER A GREAT COALITION OF BUSINESS AND LABOR, OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND TOGETHER WE WILL TAKE ON THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] THE STORIES THAT I HEAR, THE PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCES AND FRIENDS THAT I HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT NOTHING OTHER THAN HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE SHOULD BE THE STANDARD. WHEN I WAS WORKING ON MY HEALTH CARE PLAN, THERE WERE THOSE THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL, THAT'S POLITICALLY RISKY. YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU JUST CUT YOURSELF A LITTLE SLACK HERE. IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT TO LEAVE PEOPLE OUT. THAT'S A BETTER POLITICAL CASE TO MAKE. WELL, WHO SHOULD I LEAVE OUT? WHO GETS TO CHOOSE WHO IS LEFT OUT? WHEN I LEAVE OUT PEOPLE LIKE DAWN CARSON AND HER HUSBAND GREG? THEY RUN THEIR OWN AUTO BODY SHOP. THEY WORK REALLY LONG HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD INSURANCE. SHOULD I TELL THEM JUST TO ROLL THE DIES? SHOULD I LEAVE OUT ELLEN DID YOU HAVY, A NURSE I MET IN WATERLOO, DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. HER TREATMENT MADE HER SO SICK SHE COULDN'T CONTINUE TO WORK. WHEN SHE RECOVERED AND WENT BACK TO WORK THE HOSPITAL TOLD HER SHE NO LONGER HAD A JOB AND SHE LOST HER HEALTH INSURANCE. WHO SHOULD I LEAVE OUT? I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY OUT. I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAN AIDS ON THIS PROBLEM. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SOLVE IT. I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THAT CASE. [ APPLAUSE ] WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING FOR OUR SENIORS. WE'LL PROVIDE RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR WORKING AMERICANS. WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE LONG TERM CARE. I WILL GO AFTER THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT SWINDLE SENIORS OUT OF THEIR MONEY, SOMETIMES OUT OF THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. AND I WITH GO AFTER THOSE NURSING HOMES THAT ABUSE OUR SENIORS. WE'RE GOING HAVE MORE HOME HEALTH AID, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE DIG ANY ELECTRIFIED AND RESPECTABLE ALTERNATIVES. I WANT TO PROVIDE A $3,000 TAX CREDIT FOR CAREGIVERS WHO DO THE HARD WORK OF CARING FOR NOT ONLY AGEING FAMILY MEMBERS BUT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. THIS IS A LABOR OF LOVE. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS THAT ANY OF US WILL EVER DO AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE PENALIZED FOR IT. ICE IN A CITY TWO WEEKS OR SO AGO AND THERE WAS A MAN THERE AND A WOMAN IN THE WHEELCHAIR. THE MAN WAS STANDING BEHIND HER WITH HIS HANDS ON THE BACK OF THE WHEELCHAIR. OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD REACH OVER AND GIVE HER A DRINK AND OCCASIONALLY WIPE HER MOUTH. I CALLED ON HIM WHEN QUESTION TIME CAME AND HE TOLL ME THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR 50 YEARS. THAT SHE HAD PARKINSON'S FOR 29 YEARS AND IT GOT INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO CARE FOR HER. HE TRIED TO GET LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. NOBODY WOULD HELP HIM WITH HIS WIFE. ALL HE'S LOOKING FOR IS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP. HE WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF HER. THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER A REALLY LONG TIME. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD IF HE DONE GET ANY HELP AT ALL. I DON'T THINKS THAT'S RIGHT. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE HELP TO LOVING FAMILY MEMBERS LIKE HIM AND SO MANY OTHERS WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO GET A NEW BEGINNING ON ENERGY DEPENDENCE AND COMBATTING GLOBAL WARMING. THIS IS A SECURITY ISSUE. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. AREN'T YOU PROUD OF AL GORE GETTING THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR HIS WORK ON GLOBAL WARMING? [ APPLAUSE ] WELL, WE NEED TO TRANSLATE THAT INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT THAT HE AND MANY OTHERS HAVE MADE TO ACTION. SO I HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT. TO MOVE TOWARDS HOME GROWN ENERGY JUST LIKE WE'RE DOING HERE IN IOWA, BIO FUELS AND WITHIN. PROMOTE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. I WANT TO APPLAUD THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS WE RAISED THE GAS MILEAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES. THERE'S ENOUGH WORK FOR US TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PLANET, ECONOMY AND SECURITY. YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOOD NEWS IS? IF WE DO THIS, WE'LL CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD NEW JOBS IN IOWA AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. PLAUD WE'LL MAKE A -- WE'LL SUPPORT OUR UNION. WE'LL GIVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY. [ APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO GIVE TAX CUTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM NOT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T AND WE'RE GOING CHANGE OUR TAX CODE SO WE DON'T GIVE INCENTIVES TO THOSE WHO OUTSOURCE JOBS AND WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO MOVE TOWARDS TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT DO HAVE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS SO IT'S NOT A RACE TO THE BOTTOM BUT A REAL MOVE TO THE TOP. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. SOMETHING THAT BOB KERREY WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR HAD AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN MAKING POSSIBLE. LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED? UNDER THIS PRESIDENT ALL THAT HARD WORK HAS BEEN SQUANDERED. WE'LL GET BACK TO RECLAIMING OUR FUTURE BY STOPPING THE MORTGAGING OF OUR COUNTRY BY HAVING US BORROW BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND MEXICO AND EVERY PLACE IN BETWEEN. [ APPLAUSE ] AND WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING ON EDUCATION. WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. SOMETHING THAT CONNIE HAS WORKED ON HER ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE. WE NEED TO BUILD STRONGER FAMILIES. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE EARLY INTERVENTION. WE NEED TO HELP PARENTS KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO HELP THEIR OWN CHILDREN. THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE WORKED ON FOR DECADES. I BROUGHT A PROGRAM TO ARKANSAS THE HOME INSTRUCTION FOR PRE-SCHOOL YOUNGSTERS PROGRAM THAT GAVE PARENTS THE TOOLS THEY NEEDED TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR US TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A CHILD'S LIFE. THEN WE'LL HAVE A UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM TO REACH THOSE KIDS WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED TO GIVE THEM MORE HELP AND SUPPORT. WE'LL END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I HAVE PLEDGED TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON WHO GOES AND IS MOTIVATED. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORGET THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE. HOW ABOUT MORE JOB TRAINING. MORE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. LET'S GIVE THEM THE HELP THAT THEY DESERVE FOR A GOOD FUTURE. WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING. I'LL ENDS THE NO BIG CONTRACTS FOR HALLIBURTON. WE'LL END THE KIND OF -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- WAR ON SCIENCE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS WAGED. IT'S TIME WE START ACTUALLY INVESTING IN SCIENCE AGAIN. SO HOW ABOUT LIFTING THE BAN ON STEM CELL RESEARCH AND HOW ABOUT -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- MAKING AMERICA THE INNOVATION NATION AGAIN. WE CAN CREATE SO MUCH IF WE HAVE A PARTNER SHIPP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR. I HAVE THIS IDEA, HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO THE GOVERNMENT AGAIN AFTER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION? [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, WE WILL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD. IT WILL START WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND AS RESPONSIBLY AS WE CAN. [ APPLAUSE ] AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT THERE WILL BE A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE THAT GOES OUT ACROSS THE WORLD. THE ERA OF COWBOY DIPLOMACY IS OVER. WE'RE GOING TO START WORKING WITH PEOPLE AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOU. I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD AS I CAN TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR TRUST. AND I NEED EVERY ONE WHO IS READY FOR CHANGE TO GO THE CAUCUSES ON JANUARY 3RD. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE, IF YOU'RE TIRED OF PAYING THROUGH THE ROOF FOR YOUR GAS EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO FILL UP YOUR CAR OR TRUCK. YOU'RE TIRE OF SEEING THE ECONOMY TILT MORE AND MORE TOWARDS THE ALREADY WEALTHY AND PRIVILEGED. IF YOU THINK IT IS TIME TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE NO INVISIBLE AMERICANS, THEN I NEED YOU TO STAND UP AND CAUCUS FOR ME. IF YOU CAN BEAR TO SEE OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN, OUR SONS AND OUR DAUGHTERS CONTINUING TO FIGHT ANOTHER COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS IS TO BRING THEM HOME, BUT YOU WANT TO BE SURE IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY, THEN I NEED YOU TO STAND AND CAUCUS FOR ME. IF YOU WANT TO GET OUR COUNTRY BACK INTO THE SOLUTION BUSINESS, FUBL OUR FUTURE -- IF YOU BELIEVE OUR FUTURE CAN BE BETTER THAN OUR PRESENT OR OUR PAST. IF YOU WANT TO FEEL THAT PRIDE AGAIN IN AMERICA, THEN I NEED YOU TO GO AND STAND UP AND CAUCUS FOR ME. BECAUSE IF YOU WILL GO AND DO THAT ON JANUARY 3RD, I PROMISE YOU, I WILL STAND AND WAGE A WINNING CAMPAIGN FOR OUR VALUES AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND THEN WHEN I'M ELECTED I'LL STAND AND FIGHT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY. LET'S MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL, I KNOW IT'S A BUSY DAY AND IF YOU HAVE TO LEAVE, PLEASE JUST GO RIGHT AHEAD BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS AND HEAR WHAT'S ON ANYBODY'S MINE. WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE WHO WILL RUN AROUND WITH THE MICROPHONE AND SO IF YOU CAN, YOU KNOW, RAISE YOUR HAND AND I'LL CALL ON YOU. YES, SIR. >> SENATOR CLINTON, WELCOME TO COUNCIL BLUFFS. AS YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRIAL BASE IS LEAVING AMERICA. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE LOSING THOUSANDS OF JOBS OVERSEAS. WHAT WILL PRESIDENT CLINTON DO TO BRING THE JOBS BACK AND PUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM BACK TO WORK HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING THAT AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR BEING PART OF THE MACHINISTS WHO ENDORSED ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. I'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR JOBS AND FIGHT TO RESTORE A MANUFACTURING BASE IN AMERICA BECAUSE, SEE I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU DON'T MAKE THINGS, YOU CANNOT SUSTAIN A STRONG AND GROWING ECONOMY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WHAT I FEAR IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE LOST WAY TOO MANY JOBS ALREADY. MANUFACTURING, WHICH ACTUALLY WENT UP IN THE 1990s HAS FALLEN. SO I WANT TO DO FIVE THINGS. NUMBER ONE, WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY SO THAT WE HAVE THE MEANS TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. THE GREAT TRAGEDY OF WHAT PRESIDENT BUSH DID WITH THE BALANCED BUDGET AND THE SURPLUS WAS PAIN STAKINGLY DEVELOPED OVER THE '90s WAS TO HANDSY CAP US, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN THE KINDS OF CHANGES THAT WILL GIVE US MORE INNOVATION, MORE NEW JOBS, A MORE COMPETITIVE WORKFORCE. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. WE WILL ALSO THEN SECONDLY TAKE A HARD LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE TRADE AGREEMENT. I'M GOING TO REVIEWRY TRADE AGREEMENT. NOW, I BELIEVE THAT IF WE HAVE A FAIR CHANCE TO COMPETE, AMERICAN WORKERS ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. AND WE CAN COMPETE WITH ANYBODY. WE'RE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS. [ APPLAUSE ] IN FACT, IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT AMERICANS WORK HARDER THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD. AND SO WHILE WE'RE WORKING HARDER, WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, AVERAGE INCOMES ARE NOT RISING. IN FACT, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAS LOST $1,000 OF INCOME IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. CONTRAST THAT TO WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE '90s WHEN THE TYPICAL IOWAN FAMILY HAD A $7,000 INCREASE IN INCOME. YOU CAN SEE THE DISPATIENT. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T ENFORCE TRADE AGREEMENTS. IT DOESN'T REALLY PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TERMS. WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE ALL OF THAT. THIRDLY, WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF ALL OF THE INCENTIVES IN OUR TAX CODE THAT STILL GIVE TAX PAYER DOLLARS TO COMPANIES THAT MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS. YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE -- [ APPLAUSE ] I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN TELL AN AMERICAN COMPANY OR AN AMERICAN EMPLOYER YOU CAN'T GO OVERSEAS PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. WE CAN'T DO THAT. THAT'S NOT OUR COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND A FREE MARKET BUT I SURE DON'T WANT THEM MAKING THAT DECISION WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS HELPING THEM. WE'LL ENDS ALL OF THOSE LOOPHOLES AND THOSE INCENTIVES. SO PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE JOBS OVERSEAS THEY HAVE TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN NICKEL NOT ON OURS. WE'LL MOVE ON THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. FOURTH, IN PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE KIND OF MANUFACTURING THAT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BRING BACK, THERE'S REALLY TWO KINDS. HIGH VALUE MANUFACTURING, LIKE WHAT A LOT OF MACHINISTS DO WITH AIRPLANES AND SO MUCH ELSE AND NEW FORMS OF MANUFACTURING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING FROM BIO TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER KINDS OF INNOVATION. SO WE'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE A WORKFORCE THAT'S TRAINED. I'LL TELL THE BEST SOURCE OF NEW JOBS, IN MY OPINION, IS GOING TO BE A NEW ENERGY AGENDA. WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND SO THAT'S WHY I PUT INTO THE ENERGY BILL THAT WAS JUST PASSED A PROVISION FOR GREEN COLLAR JOB TRAINING. BECAUSE THESE ARE JOBS THAT AREN'T LIKELY TO BE OUTSOURCED. IF WE START ACTUALLY DOING MORE AND MAKING, YOU KNOW, WINDS TURBINES LIKE I WENT TO A PLANT OUTSIDE OF CEDAR RAPIDS TO SEE THAT AND WE DO MORE TO REALLY DEVELOP MOMMY GROWN ENERGY, SUPPOSE WE MAKE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO GIVING YOU TAX INCENTIVES TO USE SO FLAERJ, WELL SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO CLIMB UP ON THAT ROOF AND PUT THE SOLAR PANEL ON. THESE ARE GOOD SOLID JOBS AND THEY ARE TIED INTO MANUFACTURING AND I WANT TO START HAVING MORE MANUFACTURING DONE FOR CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY IN AMERICA. FINALLY WE GOT TO STANDS UP TO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES, MANIPULATE THEIR CURRENCY AND USE AN ADVANTAGE AGAINST US INSTEAD OF FUNCTIONING OR OPERATING COMPETING BY THE SAME RULES. SO, WHEN IT COMES TO COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA, THEY HAVE TO PLAY BY THE SAME RULES. THEY CAN'T PLAY BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES ANY MORE. IF THEY DO PLAY BY THE SAME SET OF RULES WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF BEING COMPETITIVE. I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ISSUE ON. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE MACHINISTS SUPPORT ME. I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOUR ENDORSEMENT AND YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR CLINTON. WILL YOU GO TO BEIJING ASK THEM TELL THEM THAT THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THAT WE DO AND TO DO ANALYSTAL STANDARDS THAT THEY WILL LIKELY HAVE TO TAKE ON. >> YES. AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. THERE'S A COUPLE OF DINT WAYS OF APPROACHING IT. THERE ARE CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING TO HAVE THEM FOLLOW RIGHT NOW. STANDARDS AFFECTING FOOD, THE PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OF FOOD, FOR EXAMPLE. AND I THINK WE HAVE A VERY STRONG HAND IN THIS WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN ADVOCATING WE SHOULD BE VERY TOUGH WITH THE CHINESE AND SAY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP TAKING ALL OF YOUR EXPORTS UNLESS YOU HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR STANDARDS THAT SUIT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE APPROPRIATE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT MORE INSPECTORS IN THERE, GET MORE INFORMATION AND TRANSPARENCY FROM THEM. YOU KNOW, IF YOU TALK TO THE FARMERS I REPRESENT, I HAVE ABOUT 34,000 FAMILY FARMS IN NEW YORK, A LOT OF DAIRY, FRUIT AND VEGETABLES, THEY WILL TELL YOU THEY HAVE TO KEEP METICULOUS RECORDS OF EVERY PESTICIDE OR ANY OTHER CHEMICAL THEY USE ON THEIR CROPS OR DAIRY CATTLE. YOU CAN GO AND CHECK IT AND THE GOVERNMENT CAN HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT'S BEING DONE TO THE FOOD THAT EVENTUALLY COMES TO OUR TABLES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THAT'S NOT GOOD AND THAT'S NOT THE STANDARDS THAT I WANT TO SEE FOLLOWED. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO INCLUDE THE FAST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA IN WHATEVER WE DO ON GLOBAL WARMING. AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT I WILL TACKLE BECAUSE WHEN I PUT OUT MY ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING PLAN I SAID THAT AS PRESIDENT I WILL IMMEDIATELY REACH OUT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AND ASK THEM TO START MEETING EVERY THREE MONTHS, INCLUDING THE BIGGEST GREENHOUSE GAS E MITTING NATIONS. EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, UNITED STATES, MEXICO, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA, SOUTH AFRICA AND BRAZIL. THEY ALL HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. IT MAY BE A DIFFERENT SOLUTION DEPENDING ON WHICH PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT THEY EVER. BUT I INTEND TO WORK TOWARDS AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY THAT WILL INCLUDE EVERYONE. AND LET'S THINK OF CREATIVE WAYS TO HELP A COUNTRY LIKE INDIA OR CHINA. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SEE FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THAT HERE WE HAVE POLLUTED THE ATMOSPHERE FOR 150 YEARS DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, FILLING IT WITH, YOU KNOW, THE EFFECTS OF A CARBON BASED ECONOMY, AND NOW EVERYBODY IS WORRIED AS WE SHOULD BE ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING SO WE WANT TO SAY STOP YOUR DEVELOPMENT OR AT LEAST DO IT DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DID. SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SAY LET'S GET RICH FIRST LIKE YOU. BUT THE WORLD CAN'T AFFORD FOR THEM TO DO THAT. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS SAY LET'S WORK TOGETHER. LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN USE SO YOU HAVE CLEANER FORM OF ENERGY. LET'S HAVE SOME BIG DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE SEQUESTER CARBON OUT OF COAL. THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN DO IF WE WORK TOGETHER AS A WORLD. REMEMBER THE MOVIE ""INDEPENDENCE DAY"" AND ALIENS CAME FROM OUTER SPACE? WHY CAN WE BE UNITED ON BEHALF OF OUR PLANET. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO. YES. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR CLINTON. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW 70% OF THE POOR IN THIS COUNTRY ARE WOMEN, ESPECIALLY WOMEN WITH CHILDREN. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO TO HELP THESE WOMEN ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO PAID MA TERN NIT LEAVE. >> THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO. I HAVE BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR PROVIDING MORE HELP TO WOMEN PARTICULARLY SINGLE MOTHERS FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE IT'S A HARD JOB. IF YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM IT'S DOUBLY HARD. WHAT MORE CAN WE DO? WELL MAKING SURE WE HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYBODY WOULD BE A BIG, BIG HELP. NUMBER TWO, GIVING PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR MORE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY CAN THEN BETTER THEMSELVES? NUMBER THREE, MORE QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE. IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS WHY IT'S HARD FOR PARENTS AND ESPECIALLY SINGLE PARENTS TO BE IN THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE IT'S UNRELIABLE, IT'S NOT VERY HIGH QUALITY IN MANY INSTANCES AND IT DOESN'T EXACTLY, YOU KNOW, PROVIDE THE SUPPORT YOU NEED WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO TO WORK SUPPORT YOUR CHILDREN. I ALSO BELIEVE WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE IN OUR COUNTRY TO BALANCE FAMILY AND WORK IT. SPEMPBSED THAT AS A YOUNG MOTHER. I HAD A LOT MORE RESOURCES THAN MOST YOUNG MOTHERS BUT IT WAS HARD. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR CHILD IS ILL OR WHEN YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF AN EMERGENCY AT HOME AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT WORK, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE CONFLICTS. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE AN EXPANSION OF FAMILY LEAVE TO COVER MORE PARENTS, AND I JUST WAS SUCCESSFUL WITH SENATOR DOD IN EXPANDING FAMILY LEAVE FOR THE FAMILIES OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS SO THEY COULD SPEND TIME WITH THEIR YOUNG SON OR DAUGHTER WHO HAD BEEN WOUNDED. WE NEED TO EXPAND IT FOR EVERYBODY. WE NEED TO LOOK AT GIVING THE STATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIMENT WITH PAID LEAVE AND OTHER KINDS OF WORK SUPPORT LIKE MORE FLEXIBLE WORK HOURS, MORE TELECOMMUTING. THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO. BECAUSE OF MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF A MOM WHO BALANCED FAMILY AND WORK I'LL BE VERY COMMITTED TO DOING MORE ABOUT THIS AND CAN YOU GO MY WEBSITE AND SEE ALL OF THE POLICIES THAT I HAVE PROPOSED BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL TO ME. WE GOT MAKE -- WE SHOULD NOT PUNISH PEOPLE WHO WORK AND RAISE A FAMILY AND WE DO ALL TOO OFTEN IN OUR COUNTRY. I WANT TO END THAT AND REALLY BUILD UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE BOTH A GOOD WORKER AND A GOOD PARENT. [ APPLAUSE ] RIGHT THERE. YES, I DO. THEN WE'LL GO TO YOU DEER DEER. LET ME ANSWER THIS QUESTION FIRST. LOOK, IT'S HARD TO TELL, I BELIEVE, WHETHER NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND UNDERSTAND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS DOOMED FROM THE START BECAUSE THEY RENEGED ON THE MONEY THEY SAID THEY WOULD PUT IN IT. ONE OF THE UNTOLD STORIES IS HOW A REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE, JIM JEFFERS OF VERMONT, HAD AN AGREEMENT HE THOUGHT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE TO PASS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND TEEN HAVE IT FUNDED AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. SO THE CONGRESS PASSED IT. AND THEN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET CAME OUT AND DIDN'T FUND IT AT THE LEVEL THAT HAD BEEN PROMISED. SENATOR JEFFERS WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE, MET WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND HIS TOP ADVISORS AND HE SAID YOU TOLD ME YOU HAD PUT THE MONEY THAT WAS NEEDED INTO THIS BILL. AND THEY SAID WE'RE SORRY WE CAN'T. BUT JIM JEFFERS LEFT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BECAUSE IT WAS A BREACH OF WHAT HAD BEEN PROMISED. SO IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER IT WAS DOOMED FROM THE BEGINNING OR WHETHER IT'S BEEN SO POORLY IMPLEMENTED BUT THE FACT IS THAT IT'S NOT WORKING THAT EVERYONE ADVERTISED. HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO. I THINK WE HAVE TO SET A MUCH MORE REALISTIC BENCHMARK THAN WHAT IS SET UNDER NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND THE SO-CALLED PROFICIENCY LEVELS. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS TO SAY EVERYBODY IN THIS CLASS AND IN THIS SCHOOL HAS TO GET TO THE SAME LEVEL. WELL SUPPOSE YOU'RE IN A CLASS WITH 25 STUDENTS. AND LET'S SAY FIVE ARE SPECIAL ED STUDENTS AND FIVE DON'T HAVE ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE, AND THEN 15 OF THEM HAVE ALL VARYING LEVELS OF ABILITY AND PREPARATION. AND SUPPOSE YOU TEST THESE CHILDREN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. AND THEIR AVERAGE SCORE IN THAT CLASS ON A SCALE OF 2001 FIVE IS A TWO. AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR YOU TEST THEM AND THEY HAVE GONE UP TO A FOUR. I THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS. BUT THE PROFICIENCY SEA LEVEL A FIVE. SO, THE TEACHER AND STUDENTS ARE TOLD THEY ARE FAILURES. I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG MESSAGE TO SENDS. AND I ALSO BELIEVE -- [ APPLAUSE ] THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE ON INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION. YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED GROWTH MODELS SO WE LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DOES THAT CHILD NEED INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THEM AS LITTLE TEST TAKERS AND TURNING TEACHERS INTO TEST GIVES. WE OUGHT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE EDUCATION SHOULD BE HEADED. YOU KNOW, MEDICINE IS HEADED THAT WAY WITH THE HUMAN GENO, WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE US SEPTEMBER TIBL TO. WE'LL BE MOVING TOWARDS ONE BERN DIABETES MAY GET A DIFFERENT TREATMENT THAN ANOTHER PERSON BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY INSIDE THEM. WELL EVERY CHILD HAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT INSIDE THEM OR HER. OUR JOB SHOULD BE TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS OF EDUCATION THAT WILL GIVE EVERY CHILD A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD GIVEN POTENTIAL. THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO HELP OUR TEACHERS. WE GOT TO HAVE MUCH BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAN THE GROSS ONES WE HAVE THAT DON'T TELL US ENOUGH ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN. WE SHOULD START DOING WHAT WE KNOW WORKS, PRE-SCHOOL STARTING AT BIRTH WORKS. WHY DON'T WE INVEST IN MORE PROGRAMS THAT CONNIE DOES? WHY DON'T WE DO THAT? WHY DON'T WE INVEST IN PRE-KINDER GARTEN OR IN SMALLER CLASSES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE AN AFTER SCHOOL MENTORING PROGRAM INSTEAD OF THESE SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN LARGELY TURNED OVER FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES TO KRONYS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT THEY ARE PRODUCING ANY RESULTS. LET'S DO WHAT WE KNOW WORKS CHILDREN AND LET'S GIVE TEACHERS A CHANCE TO REALLY DO WHAT THEY CAME TO TEACH FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE. [ APPLAUSE ] YES. RIGHT THERE. THIS WILL BE OUR LAST QUESTION. >> OBAMA HAS HIS IDEAS ON TOY SAFETY. WHAT IS YOUR IDEA ON TOY SAFETY? >> I TALK ABOUT TOY SAFETY SEVERAL MONTHS AGO BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT TOY SAFETY. I DON'T THINK ANY PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE TOYS YOU BUY FOR YOUR CHILDREN FOR CHRISTMAS. YOU KNOW, CHILDREN, WE KNOW, ARE VERY INQUISITIVE. THEY PUT EVERYTHING IN THEIR MOUTHS. THEY SLEEP WITH THINGS. THEY LICK THINGS. WE KNOW ALL OF THAT. SO, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THE SAFETY OF OUR TOYS THAT WE MIGHT GIVE TO A CHERISHED CHILD OR GRANDCHILD. SO I HAVE SAID I WOULD STOP ALL IMPORTS OF TOYS FROM CHINA UNTIL WE CAN INSPECT THEM, UNTIL WE HAVE SOME SYSTEM OF KNOWING WHETHER THEY WERE SAFE. [ APPLAUSE ] AND THAT IS NOT ONLY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THE CHINESE TO DO BUT THE AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT ARE MANUFACTURING THESE TOYS SHOULD BE THOELD THIS STANDARD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO BE PART OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. WE SHOULD EXPAND THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION, SOMETHING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR CONSUMERS BUT UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS BASICALLY LOOKED OUT FOR CORPORATION. GIVE IT ENOUGH STAFF AND RESOURCES SO IT CAN GIVE PEOPLE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE ON THE INTERNET. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET EVERY TEST, EVERY COMPLAINT ABOUT ANY PRODUCT SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN MIND UP. I THINK THAT'S TRUE NOT ONLY FOR TIES, BUT IT'S TRUE FOR FOOD AND DRUGS. WE HAVE TO GIVE CONSUMERS MORE INFORMATION AND FINALLY IN THE FARM BILL THAT TOM HARKIN HAS JUST BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE CONGRESS AND IT'S BEEN A REAL, YOU KNOW, DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR TOM BUT HE DID IT AGAIN, WE FINALLY ARE GOING TO ENFORCE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELLING. IT'S LONG PASTIME. WE DESERVE TO KNOW WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM. SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE AND I HOPE, I HOPE YOU WILL COME AND CAUCUS FOR ME. IF YOU NEED A RIDE, PHYSICIAN YOU NEED ANY OTHER KIND OF HELP, PLEASE LET MY STAFF KNOW WHERE MY WONDERFUL STAFF AND FIELD ORGANIZERS WAVING HOLDING CLIP BOAR. WE HAVE CARD. WE WANT YOU TO CONSIDER SIGN UP TO CAUCUS FOR ME. BE A PART OF THIS WONDERFUL CAMPAIGN WE'RE PUTTING HERE IN IOWA. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?202720-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"I WAS INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AFFECTING SMALL CHILDREN THAT HAD SOME DIFFERENTS, HAD SOME DISADVANTAGES TO OVERCOME, SO I WANT TO DO MORE TO HELP FAMILIES, I WANT TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAM, LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN IOWA, TO HELP EVERY CHILD ESPECIALLY FOR DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS GET BETTER PREPARED AND I WANT TO END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WHICH HAS INTERFERED WITH LEARNING AND TEACHING. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE HAVE TO START REIMAGINING EDUCATION. IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY. I GO INTO CLASSROOMS ACROSS AMERICA, I WAS IN SCHOOL IN IOWA HERE ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO, AND THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON THAT WAS DIFFERENT AND NEW AND THERE WERE COMPUTERS, BUT THE CLASSROOMS LOOKED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THEY LOOKED WHEN I WAS THERE WITH BETSY BACK IN SIXTH GRADE, SO LET'S START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAILOR INSTRUCTION MORE TO MEET INDIVIDUAL CHILDRENS' NEEDS BECAUSE EVERY CHILD LEARNS DIFFERENTLY AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO HELP GIVE EACH CHILD A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL AND I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL ACTUALLY WORK WITH TEACHERS AND WORK WITH OTHERS WHO CARE ABOUT IMPROVING EDUCATION THE RIGHT WAY. AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES, AND LET'S MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE KIDS WHO WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL, I MEET THEM ALL OVER IOWA, WHO SAY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO AFFORD IT, THEY HAVE TO GO INTO SUCH DEEP DEBT. BELL -- WELL, I WANT EF PERSON WHO IS WILLING TO WORK HARD TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND DON'T FORGET THE MAJORITY OF OUR KIDS WILL NOT GO TO CLEN, LET'S TAKE CARE OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO FIGHT OUR WARS, TAKE CARE OF US, WHO PROTECT US. [APPLAUSE] >> YOU KNOW, EDUCATION IS STILL THE PASSPORT TO OPPORTUNITY, AND WE NEED TO STAMP THAT PASSPORT. IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY. AND START MAKING IT WORK AGAIN. WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO REFORMING OUR GOVERNMENT. NO MORE, NO BIG CONTRACTS AND CRONYISM AND CORRUPTION AND INCOMPETENCE AND INNOCENCETIVITY. >> [APPLAUSE -- AND INNOCENCETIVITY. [APPLAUSE] >> EVERY ONE OF US IS A CUSTOMER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT I SURE DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN GETTING VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED AND THE. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION, HOW ABOUT ELECTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE JOBS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGAIN, PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO, ARE COMMITTED TO DOING IT, AND CAN DELIVER RESULTS. >> AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW BEGINNING TO AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND AS RESPONSIBLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. [APPLAUSE] >> WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL. WE'RE GOING TO THANK THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR COUNTRY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY WERE ASKED TO DO. [APPLAUSE] BUT THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION, WE SHOULD NOT PERMIT THEM TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AS REFEREES OF THE IRAQI CIVIL WAR. IT IS UP TO THE IRAQIS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY. AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, THEY WILL HAVE TO DO JUST THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> AND WHEN OUR TROOPS COME HOME, WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. A LOT WILL BE NEEDING HEALTH CARE. THEY'VE BEEN INJURED AND WOUNDED, SOME OF IT'S VISIBLE, LOST ARMS AND LEGS, THEY'VE BEEN BLINDED, SOME OF IT'S NOT SO VISIBLE. IT'S A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, IT'S THE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS AT WALTER REED VISITING WITH SOLDIERS WHO HAD COME BACK FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND I MET WITH VERY HANDSOME YOUNG ARMY CAPTAIN WHO HAD LOST HIS RIGHT ARM IN BAGHDAD AND LOST THE RING FINGER ON HIS LEFT HAND WHEN HIS WEDDING RING MELTED INTO HIS FINGER, SO I SAID CAPTAIN, HOW YOU DOING? HOW'S IT COMING FOR YOU? HE GOES YOU KNOW, I'M LEARNING HOW TO USE THE PROSTHETHIC, THEY'RE REALLY HELPFUL, TEACHING ME WHAT TO DO, BUT THEN HE SAID BUT WHERE DO I GO TO GET MY BRAIN BACK? BECAUSE THOSE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THAT KILL AND MAME SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG AND MEN AND WOMEN ALSO PRODUCE A CONCUSSIVE EFFECT, A SHAKING OF THE BRAIN. HE SAID YOU KNOW, I WENT TO WEST POINT, I NEVER HAD ANYBODY TAKE CARE OF ME, NOW MY WIFE HAS TO GIVE ME A LIST EVERY MORNING ABOUT WHAT I HAVE TO DO, AND WHAT I DO NEXT AND WHAT I DO THEN, SO I WORK TO GET LEGISLATION TO PASSED TO BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES BUT I WILL PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO TAKES CARE OF OUR VETERANS. I THINK IT IS DISGRACEFUL THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WAITING MONTHS FOR APPOINTMENTS, THEY CAN'T GET THEIR DISABILITY CLAIMS PROCESSED, THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO EITHER KNOW OR EVIDENCE ANY CONCERN, AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, VETERANS ARE GOING TO GET THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TREATMENT, NOT JUST THOSE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, BUT ALL OUR VETERANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM MY OWN GENERATION WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM WHO NEVER GOT THE WELCOME AND THE HELP THEY DESERVED TO HAVE. [APPLAUSE] >> SO WE CAN HAVE A NEW BEGINNING IN AMERICA, BUT I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS AND ALL THE OTHER ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN MY CAMPAIGN WITHOUT YOUR HELP. NOW, ON JANUARY 3RD, YOU HAVE A BIG DECISION. I WAS THRILLED AND HONORED TO GET THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE DES MOINES REGISTER. THEY PUT US THROUGH OUR PACES. [APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MORE GRUELING PROCESS. THEY NOT ONLY INTERVIEWED 18 OF US ONCE, THEY INTERVIEWED EIGHT OF US TWICE, PLUS THEY DID RESEARCH, PLUS THEY ASKED PROBING QUESTIONS IN OTHER SETTINGS WHERE THEY REALLY WERE TAKING OUR MEASURE. YOU KNOW, I WAS IN DUNLAP YESTERDAY AT A SALE BARN, A LIVESTOCK SALE BARN, AND I'VE BEEN IN SALE BARNS OFTEN, PARTICULARLY IN ARKANSAS, AND I WAS STANDING UP WHERE THEY SHOW THE CATTLE AND I SAID I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS THIS POSITION, BUT THAT'S THE WAY I FELT. I THOUGHT OKAY, YOU WANT TO LOOK INSIDE MY MOUTH, ALL RIGHT, HAVE AT IT. BUT AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS, THEY MADE THE CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY. WE HAVE GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING. EVERYBODY BRINGS DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES, QUALIFICATIONS, DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. BUT THE REGISTER SAID WHAT I BELIEVE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MINUTE TO WASTE, WE DON'T HAVE A MARGIN FOR ERROR. WE'LL ALWAYS MAKE MISTAKES, WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS, BUT WE'VE GOT TO GO FOR PROVEN LEADERSHIP. IT'S BEEN TESTED, THAT IS READY ON DAY ONE. I OFFER THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA FOR THESE CAUCUSES. I HOPE YOU WILL DECIDE TO GO AND STAND UP FOR ME IN YOUR CAUCUS. I'M SO EXCITED BY THE GROWING ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM AND PEOPLE COMING ON BOARD FROM ACROSS THE STATE. JUST IN ONE DAY, I MET A 17-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS JUST ABOUT TO TURN 18 AND WAS GOING TO CAUCUS FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR ME, AND I HEARD ABOUT A 102-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO IS DETERMINED TO GO TO THE CAULK YOUS AND -- CAUCUSES AND HAS MADE HIS 81-YEAR-OLD SON PROMISE TO TAKE HIM. [LAUGHTER] >> SO I'M ASKING YOU TO STAND UP FOR ME FOR ONE NIGHT, AND I WILL STAND UP FOR YOU THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, STANDING UP FOR OUR VALUES, OUR PRINCIPLES, FOR THE KIND OF CHANGE WE NEED TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, JUST AS I DID IN NEW YORK, AND THEN I WILL STAND UP EF SINGLE DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU, AND ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES, ABOUT YOUR JOBS AND YOUR HEALTH CARE. I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY AROUND THE WORLD. AND TOGETHER, WE WILL NOT ONLY MAKE HISTORY, BUT WE WILL ONCE AGAIN FEEL PRIDE AND PROGRESS IN THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU ALL. I KNOW THIS IS A BUSY TIME OF YEAR WITH THE HOLIDAYS BUT I'D BE GLAD TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS, AND THEN I WOULD LOVE TO SAY HELLO TO AS MANY OF YOU AS AS I POSSIBLY CAN, BUT IF YOU HAVE TO GO, HAVE TO GO TO WORK, GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, DO CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. DOES ANYBODY HAVE A QUESTION THAT THEY WANT TO ASK? YES, MA'AM. PLEASE SIT DOWN, THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO STAY AND I'LL BE ABLE TO CALL ON PEOPLE. >> I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECIFIT. >> HAND HER THE MICROPHONE, OKAY? JUST HAND IT TO HER. THANK YOU. >> I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECIFIT, AND IT AMAZES ME THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT ALL THESE THINGS COST MONEY, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE -- DON'T TAX -- ARE DON'T TAX ME, TAX THE GUY BEHIND THE TREE. BUT ANYWAY, HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THE DECIFIT WITH ALL OF THE FINANCIAL NEEDS THAT WE HAVE? >> WELL, I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECIFIT, AND I INTEND TO MOVE OUR COUNTRY BACK TOWARD FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. YOU KNOW, WHEN GEORGE BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT, HE INHERITED A BALANCED BUDGET AND SURPLUS AND HE SQUANDERED IT ALL AND HE HAS UNDERMINED OUR FISCAL SOVEREIGNTY BECAUSE WE ARE DEPENDENT ON COUNTRIES FROM CHINA TO MEXICO TO BORROW MONEY FROM EVERY SINGLE DAY. YOU KNOW, THE EASIEST WAY TO SUM IT UP IS WE BORROW MONEY FROM CHINA TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. THAT IS NOT A SMART POLICY. SO I WANT TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE AT THE END OF MY HUSBAND'S ADMINISTRATION, WHERE WE WILL HAVE THE FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THE TOUGH DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE. NOW, THERE ARE TWO THINGS I WILL DO TO REVERSE PRESIDENT BUSH'S TWO BIGGEST PRIORITIES. HIS TWO BIGGEST PRIORITIES ARE TAX CUTS FOR THE RELTEST OF AMERICANS AND THE WAR IN IRAQ. I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO A TAX SYSTEM THAT HONORS AND REWARDS THE MIDDLE CLASS AND HARD WORKING PEOPLE AND WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE WEALTHIEST 1 PERCENT TO GET BACK TO THE TAX RATES THEY HAD IN THE '90S. IT DIDN'T HURT THEM AND IT HELPED THE COUNTRY. THEN I'M GOING TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING HOME ALL THAT MONEY, $300 MILLION A DAY. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE THEN TO REORDER OUR PRIORITIES SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL MAKE US RICHER AND SAFER AND STRONGER AND FAIRER IN THE FUTURE. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE KIND OF BUDGET DISCIPLINE WHERE YOU CANNOT RAISE SPENDING OR CUT TAXES UNLESS YOU PAY FOR IT, SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN THROWN OUT THE WINDOW BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO MAKING SURE THAT WE CREATE MORE JOBS HERE IN AMERICA. THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. AND WE USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. NOT IN ANCIENT HISTORY, BUT IN THE '90S, WE HAD 22.7 MILLION JOBS. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, AN OPPONENT OF MINE WILL SAY WELL, SHE TALKS ABOUT THE '90S TOO MUCH. WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS THE GREATEST ECONOMIC ERA WE HAD HAD IN DECADES. MORE PEOPLE WENT TO WORK, MORE INCOMES WERE INCREASING, MORE PEOPLE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY. [APPLAUSE] >> I THRNG ARE SOME LESSONS WE CAN LEARN THERE, CERTAINLY IN CONTRAST TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST # YEARS. YOU KNOW, DURING THE '90S, THE TYPICAL FAMILY IN IOWA ACTUALLY HAD AN INCREASE OF $7000 IN INCOME. THE TYPICAL FAMILY IN AMERICA IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS HAS HAD A DROP OF $1000 IN INCOME. DURING THE '90S, HEALTH CARE INFLATION WAS KEPT LOW. IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, HEALTH CARE COSTS HAVE DOUBLED. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THE '90S, WHERE OIL WAS $20 A BARREL, GAS PRICES WEREN'T BANKRUPTING PEEP. NOW, ENERGY COSTS FOR AN AVERAGE FAMILY HAVE GONE UP $2000 IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. SO I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WORKS. BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO GET BACK TO DOING WHAT WORKS INMARK AND NOT GET DIVERTED BY IDEOLOGY AND PARTISANSHIP. AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE A KEY GOAL FOR US. [APPLAUSE] AND I'M LUCKY THAT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DID IT THE FIRST TIME THAT CAN HELP DO IT AGAIN. ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID A WHILE AGO, IT LOOKS LIKE IT TAKES A CLINTON TO CLEAN UP AFTER A BUSH WHEN IT COMES TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND I'M READY TO DO THAT IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. SEE, I SAW A HAND -- YES MA'AM. >> I WANT TO HEAR IT. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE NAVY? >> I'VE BEEN IN THE NAVY THREE YEARS. >> OKAY. >> MY QUESTION IS, I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AND LET MY VOICE BE HEARD IN THE PRIMARIES BUT BECAUSE THE CAUCUS SYSTEM, I'LL BE IN SAN DIEGO AT MY DUTY STATION. AS I KNOW IT, THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARIES. WHAT TYPES OF ACTIONS SHOULD WE TAKE TO FIX THIS FOR SERVICE MEMBERS AROUND THE NATION AND DEPLOYED AROUND THE WORLD? >> THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. EVERYBODY HEAR WHAT HE ASKED? WELL, HE ASKED -- HE SAID HE'S STATIONED AT SAN DIEGO, HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE ON JANUARY 3RD, HE'D LOVE TO HAVE HIS VOICE COUNTED IN THE CAUCUSES, HE CAN'T PARTICIPATE. YOU'RE NOT ALONE. IT'S NOT ONLY OUR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY, IT'S OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES. FOR THE CAUCUSES, IT'S PEOPLE WHO WORK AT NIGHT. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I'VE HAD SAY TO ME I'M A NURSE, I CAN'T GET OFF THAT DAY, OR YOU KNOW, I WORK NIGHTS, I'D LOVE TO THERE BE TO SUPPORT YOU, BUT I CAN'T COME. I THINK IT'S -- YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE AND PERHAPS THE PEOPLE OF IOWA CAN THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THAT, PARTICULARLY WITH SO MANY IOWANS SERVING IN THE MILITARY NOW. YOU KNOW, IF IT'S AN ELECTION, YOU CAN GET AN ABSENTEE BALLOT AND SENT IT IN AND THEN YOU CAN BE COUNTED, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE PROBLEMS SOMETIMES GETTING OUR MILITARY BALLOTS TO OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND GETTING THEM BACK, BUT I'M GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL, SO I REALLY SYMPATHIZE, BECAUSE OF ALL THE VOICES WE SHOULD HEAR, IT SHOULD BE SOMEONE WHO IS SERVING OUR COUNTRY AS YOU ARE, AND I HOPE YOU'LL SEND SOMEBODY IN YOUR STEAD TO BE THERE TO STAND UP FOR YOU, BUT I HOPE WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW YOUR VOICE CAN BE HEARD AS WELL BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING I TAKE SERIOUSLY, AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. MY DAD WAS IN THE NAVY, AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY. [APPLAUSE] >> YEAH, I WAS JUST WONDERING, WHAT'S YOUR ETHICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR YOUR POSITION ON THE DEATH PENALTY? >> WELL, I SUPPORT THE DEATH PENALTY FOR HEINOUS CRIMES. I TAUGHT CRIMINAL LAW IN THE LAW SCHOOL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT FAYETTEVILLE, AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A RIGHT FOR A SOCIETY IN THE FACE OF PARTICULARLY HORRIBLE CRIMES THAT REALLY STRIKE AT OUR CONSCIENCE, STRIKE AT, YOU KNOW, THE VITAL NEED OF OUR SOCIETY LIKE THE HIJACKERS WHO KILLED THEMSELVES AND KILLED SO MANY OTHERS IN NEW YORK. AND I FEEL THAT THAT IS JUSTIFIABLE. HOWEVER, I DO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR. AND I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS. AND I HAVE SUPPORTED MAKING CHANGES THAT GIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCUSED OF CAPITAL OFFENSES MUCH MORE SUPPORT, ACCESS TO DNA TESTS, MUCH MORE QUALIFIED DEFENSE ATTORNEYS, AND I REALLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT HOW WE ADMINISTER IT, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY INNOCENT PERSON, AND WE KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE LAST, YOU KNOW, TEN, 15 YEARS, HAVE COME OFF OF DEATH ROW BECAUSE THEY WERE LATER PROVEN TO BE INNOCENT. SO I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO TAKE A HARD LOOK. NOW, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A LIMITED ROLE IN THIS, IT'S MOSTLY IN THE STATES, BUT I ENCOURAGE STATES TO DO IT, LIKE THE STATE OF ILLINOIS DID WHEN THEY SAID WE WERE GOING TO STOP AND TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT OUR DEATH PENALTY SYSTEM WAS AND WHO WAS ON DEATH ROW. SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY YOU EITHER DO OR DON'T BELIEVE THAT A SOCIETY HAS A RIGHT AND LIMITED PURPOSES TO INFLICT THE DEATH PENALTY AND THEN HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED AND I WILL TRY TO TAKE A VERY HARD LOOK AT THAT AND MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE TIME I'M PRESIDENT. YES. >> IT'S AN EXCITING TIME TO BE ALIVE. I TOOK MY TEN-YEAR-OLD TO SEE YOU THREE WEEKS AGO, AND I SAID WHAT DID YOU THINK? AND SHE SAID SHE LOOKS LIKE A PRESIDENT. AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. [APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE A BIT OF A TIM RUSSERT TWO-PART DWE -- QUESTION SO FORGIVE ME FOR THAT, BUT YOU HAVE A $50 BILLION ENERGY FUND AND THE FIRST PART IS KIND OF A FACT CHECK. IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT THAT FUND WOULD PAY FOR, HAVE YOU DEDICATED A BILLION DOLLARS TO CAPTURE CARBON FROM COAL TO ELECTRICITY PLANS PLANTS, AND SECONDLY THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT COMES OUT OF THAT, HOW DO WE PROTECT AMERICA'S FAMILIES FROM BEARING THAT COST, IS THAT THROUGH TAX CREDITS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? >> GREAT QUESTIONS, AND YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE SUCH A SMART DAUGHTER. I DO HAVE A $50 BILLION STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND, AND IT IS FUNDED BY SEVERAL REVENUE SOURCES. ONE IS TO TAKE THE TAX SUBSIDIES AWAY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES, BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY TO MAKE A PROFIT. THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL. THEY'RE VERY POWERFUL, BUT WE HAVE TO STAY ON THIS. WE WERE ABLE TO PASS IT IN THE CONGRESS, BUT THEN WE RAN INTO THE REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTER, BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUING TO SUBSIDIZE OIL EXPLORATION AND OIL EXTRACTION AND DISTRIBUTION. SO I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT AT THEM AND I'M ALSO GOING TO SAY TO THEM THAT THEY'VE GOT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION, NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM AND BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING THESE UNBELIEVABLE PROFITS, WE'RE GOING TO SAY TO THEM, YOU'VE GOT TO EITHER INVEST IN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY YOURSELF OR YOU HAVE TO PAY INTO THIS FUND, BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS LIKE WHAT I SAID BEFORE, THE APOLLO MOONSHOT, WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A FUND THAT PUTS MONEY TO WORK AND COMING UP WITH NEW INNOVATIVE IDEAS THAT AMERICA CAN LEAD THE WORLD ON AND WE CAN CREATE NEW EXPORT INDUSTRIES AND EMPLOY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I WANT TO DO RESEARCH IN IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT COAL. WE USE A LOT OF COAL IN AMERICA. AND SOME STATES USE MORE THAN OTHER STATES, BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF COAL THAT WE HAVE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY, BUT WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEE WHETHER COAL CAN BE CLEANER. THAT'S WHY I DO WANT TO INVEST IN SOME DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO FIGURE OUT IS IT FEASIBLE TO SEQUESTER THE CARBON OUT OF COAL. I WENT TO A TOWN OUTSIDE OF BUFFALO, NEW YORK, TANAWAANDA, WHICH HAS A HUGE OLD COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT LAST SUMMER, AND I WENT THERE BECAUSE I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WITH COAL, AND WE HAD SOME PROFESSORS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO WHO HAD BEEN STUDYING THE GEOLOGY OF THAT PART OF OUR STATE AND THEY SAID LOOK, YOU'VE GOT THE PERFECT GEOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO INJECT THE CARBON INTO THE GROUND, BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL WORK BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO TRY IT, SO I WANT THOSE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I ALSO WANT TO HAVE A MORATORIUM THAT YOU CANNOT BUILD NEW COAL-FIRED PLANTS UNLESS YOU USE THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO GET THE EMISSIONS OUT OF THE AIR AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ANDIT NOT JUST CARBON DIOXIDE, IT'S MERCURY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THE MERCURY FROM COAL BEING BURNED TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY IS PRESENT IN HIGHER THAN ACCEPTABLE LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF A LOT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN AMERICA. SO WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS COAL ISSUE VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. CHINA IS PUTTING A COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT INTO OPERATION EVERY SINGLE WEEK. THEIR EMISSIONS GO UP INTO THE WIND STREAM, THEY DROP IN THE OCEANS, THEY GET INTO FISH, PEOPLE EAT THE FISH AND IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS MERCURY GETS INTO YOUR BODY. SO THE WORLD IS NOT DIVIDED BETWEEN US AND THEM. WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING OUR PLANET AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO WORK AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT AS PRESIDENT. I WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT AS SOON AS I'M ELECTED, I WILL START REACHING OUT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SAY THE UNITED STATES WILL BE A LEADER IN DEALING WITH GLOBAL WARMING, LET'S WORK WITH CHINA TO MAKE COAL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS, LET'S WORK TO HAVE SOLAR ARRAYS. THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH NOW THAT IF WE ACTUALLY INVESTED ANYWHERE NEAR A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF WHAT WE SPEND ON DEFENSE SPENDING, WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE PRODUCE ENERGY WITHIN A DECADE. YOU LOOK AT THE GREAT EXPANSES OF DESERTS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, WE COULD HAVE SOLAR ARRAYS. YOU LOOK AT ALL THE PLACES WE COULD USE WIND, GEO THERMAL, I WAS OUTSIDE OF A HOSPITAL AT BURLINGTON, ONE OF THE MOST ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOSPITALS IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT GETS ITS ENERGY FROM A GEO THERMAL SOURCE FROM A NEARBY LAKE. WE HAVE JUST SCRATCHED THE SURFACE. LOOK WHAT WE DO WITH AUTOMOBILES. WE HAVE FINALLY UNDER THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS RAISED GAS MILEAGE BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING. IF HENRY FORD CAME BACK TOMORROW AND SAW ONE OF OUR CARS, HE'D BE AMAZED AT THE GPS AND AIR BAGS, BUT IF HE LOOKED AT THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, HE'D RECOGNIZE IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS A MOD HE T. WE'RE NOT BEING INNOVATIVE, BEING DARING, WE'RE NOT BREAKING BARRIERS. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE. THEY'RE EMPLOYING PEOPLE. GERMANY HAS INVESTED MUCH MORE IN SOLAR POWER THAN WE HAVE AND THEY'VE EMPLOYED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE ARE LEAVING THIS OPPORTUNITY ON THE TABLE. THAT'S WHY I'M MAKING THE CASE IT'S OUR SECURITY, IT'S OUR ENVIRONMENT, AND IT'S OUR ECONOMY. AND THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO YOU'LL HEAR WHO SAY OH, WE CAN'T DEAL WITH A DIFFERENT ENERGY MODEL, WE'LL WRECK THE ECONOMY, OH, WE CAN'T DEAL WITH GLOBAL WARMING, WE'LL WRECK THE ECONOMY, IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THESE TWO CHALLENGES, WE'LL CERTAINLY WRECK OUR ECONOMY AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE OUT OF WORK AND WE'LL FALL FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. [APPLAUSE] >> YES, BACK THERE. [QUESTION INAUDIBLE] >> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR TIMELINE IS FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. I'M ANXIOUS. >> WELL, YOU'RE REALLY IN A DIFFICULT SPOT. BECAUSE AS A SINGLE MOM, AND AS A SOLE PROPRIETOR, IT'S REALLY HARD FOR YOU TO GET INSURANCE. THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND I WILL USE A TERM OF ART, RIP OFF SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY PUT YOU INTO LITTLE TINY POOLS, CHARGE YOU AS MUCH AS THEY CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE, AND THEN JUST SIT BACK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AND IT'S SO WRONG. SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. I HOPE WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT YEAR, ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH PRESIDENT BUSH CARES TO DO THAT. HE'S VETOING THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH PROGRAM SOIT NOT LIKELY HE'LL WORK WITH US. BUT AS SOON AS I'M ELECTED, I WILL START WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES THAT WE NEED. YOU KNOW, THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES LAST YEAR IN AMERICA SPENT $50 BILLION ON UNDERWRITING SO THEY COULD AVOID COVERING PEOPLE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, AND THEN ON FIGHTING WITH DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE BILLS AND THEY EXCLUDE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU. SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE NOBODY IS EXCLUDED. I'M NOT REQUIRING ANYTHING FROM SMALL BUSINESS. IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN, YOU'LL BE TIEBL GET MUCH MOTHER RATES THAN YOU COULD ANYWHERE ELSE. AND AS A SICKEL MOM -- A SINGLE MOM, I HOPE WE CAN COVER ALL OF YOUR CHILDREN UNDER THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE SOME PEACE OF MIND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. NOW, I KNOW HOW HARD THIS WILL BE. IT'S EASY TO SAY LET'S HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. I'VE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD AND I KNOW HOW HARD THE INTERESTS WHO DON'T WANT THIS WILL FIGHT US. YOU KNOW THEY'LL MAKE ALL OF THE USUAL CLAIMS AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO ME, WHEN I HEAR SOME OF REPUBLICANS ON THE OTHER SIDE START BEATING THE DRUM BEAT OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M PROPOSING, MY PLAN IS NOT GOVERNMENT-RUN, DOESN'T CREATE A SINGLE NEW BUREAUCRACY, IT DEPENDS UPON PRIVATE INSURANCE BUT IT REGULATES THEM DIFFERENTLY, LIKE WE REGULATE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND LIKE WE REGULATE UTILITIES. THEY'RE FREE MARKET COMPANIES, BUT THEY'VE GOT TO OPERATE IN A DIFFERENT FRAMEWORK. SO UNDER MY PLAN, INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN'T DENY COVERAGE TO ANYBODY, THEY HAVE TO COUGH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, THEY HAVE TO COVER PREVENTION. AND THOSE THAT DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, THERE STILL WILL BE A PRIVATE MARKET BECAUSE THEY WILL ONLY HAVE TO DO THAT IF THEY COME INTO THE FEDERAL PLAN. AND IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO PAY MORE THAN THEY SHOULD, WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS A MARKET FOR THAT, BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, WE WILL FINALLY HAVE COMPETITION BASED ON COST AND QUALITY. IF WE DON'T REIGN IN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE AMERICAN DOG, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME, BECAUSE I HAVE SPENT, OH, MORE THAN A DECADE NOW TALKING TO LABOR LEADERS, TALKING TO DOCTORS, NURSES, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE SYSTEM HAS TO CHANGE, AND EVERYBODY WANTS IT TO HAPPEN NOW, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAND AGAINST THE TACTICS, THE SCARE TACTICS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THEM ON. I'VE OFFERED THEM A NEW BUSINESS MODEL. THEY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS, BUT THEY HAVE TO START ACTUALLY PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE INSTEAD OF CAUSING OUR COSTS TO GO UP BATHEY WON'T TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. I THINK WE CAN GET THAT DONE IF WE ARE UNITED AS A COUNTRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH.

[APPLAUSE] >> WELL, GOOD MORNING, INDIANOLA. AND NOW I GUESS IT'S AFTERNOON, INDIANOLA, HUH? WELL, ISN'T IT GREAT TO BE IN IOWA? WE ARE IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE WORLD'S ATTENTION AND THE COUNTRY'S ATTENTION, TO SEE WHO WE'RE GOING TO SELECT AS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT. AND BEFORE I INTRODUCE THE MAN OF THE HOUR, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A COUPLE OF GUESTS THAT ARE TRAVELING WITH US. FIRST OF ALL, JIM GILCHREST WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF THE MINUTEMEN. YOU RECOGNIZE HIM. [APPLAUSE] WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE HIS ENDORSEMENT, LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. AND FORMER GOVERNOR TIM HUTCHINSON, THE FIRST REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS. HELP ME -- [APPLAUSE] IN THE 2006 CAMPAIGN, DARLA AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET ALL OF THE 2008 CANDIDATES. AND BACK IN JANUARY WHEN WE ENDORSED GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE AND I AGREED TO BE HIS IOWA STATE CHAIRMAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID, WHY MIKE HUCKABEE? HE'S AN ASTERISK IN THE POLLS. NOBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS. AND DARLA AND I SAID, HE'S A GUY THAT'S CAPABLE. ""TIME"" MAGAZINE SAID THAT HE'S THE BEST GOVERNOR. HE'S A GUY THAT FEARS GOD. WE SAY THAT HE'S A GUY THAT -- YOU BET. WE SAID HE'S A GUY THAT'S TRUSTWORTHY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE SAID WE KNOW HE'S TRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT WHAT HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO AND DID WHAT HE SAID. AND HE'S NOT HERE ABOUT DISABLING HIS OPPONENTS. HE'S TALKING ABOUT A VISION OF AMERICA, ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND NO LONGER IS HE AN ASTERISK IN THE STATE OF IOWA. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE MEDIA USED TO SAY THAT HE WAS SECOND TIER. AND THEN HE SAID HE WAS TIER AND A HALF. AND THEN HE SAID HE'S TOP TIER. BUT THEY HAVE A NEW NAME FOR HIM NOW IN IOWA. AND TODAY THEY CALL HIM FRONTRUNNER IN THE STATE OF IOWA. [APPLAUSE] SO ON JANUARY 3, I WANT YOU TO JOIN ME AND MY FAMILY TO GO OUT AND CAUCUS AND SEND A MESSAGE TO THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT THE MEDIA DOESN'T TELL US WHO OUR CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO BE, MONEY DOESN'T BUY OUR CANDIDATE, BUT IT'S THE MESSAGE AND THE MESSENGER THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR CANDIDATE AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO BE GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] SO PLEASE DO ME A GREAT FAVOR AND WELCOME A GOVERNOR FROM HOPE, ARKANSAS, WHO ISN'T GOING TO MARY HILLARY CLINTON, BUT A GOVERNOR FROM HOPE, ARKANSAS, THAT'S GOING TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BOB. THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING. I DON'T THINK THIS ROOM WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO HOLD THIS MANY PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO TEST THE CAPACITY OF THE FLOOR. SO IF ANYBODY HEARS ANY CRACKING GOING ON, WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW? YOU CAN FOLLOW ME OUT THE DOOR. SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY. I KNOW THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION. SOME READ THE PAPER. THE PAPER SAID 1:00 START TIME. WE LET FOLKS KNOW IT'S NOON. SO IF THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER SHIFT COMING, SAY IT WAS A GREAT RALEY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE. I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING EARLIER IN THE SUMMER AND WE WERE REALLY BLESSED AND FELT KIND OF FLATTERED WHEN SOMEONE TOOK A PHOTO WITH A CELL PHONE. AND TODAY YOU CAN SEE THINGS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THE INTEREST OF THE CAMPAIGN. SO I'M TRULY GRATEFUL. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO BOB, OUR CAMPAIGN CHAIR HERE IN IOWA. I SAY EVERYWHERE I GO, I HOPE HE'S GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF IOWA. ALSO MY THANKS TO JIM GILL CHEST, FOUNDER OF THE MINUTEMEN PROJECT, FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT, FOR ALSO THE WORK HE'S DOING TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OUR PLAN ON DEALING WITH THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S CONCERNED A LOT OF PEOPLE. WE THINK IT OUGHT TO BE HANDLED WITH A RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO BE HANDLED IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR TO EVERYBODY. AND JIM HAS BEEN A GREAT RESOURCE FOR US. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS BEING ON THE TRAIL WITH US TODAY. AS WELL AS A LONG-TIME FRIEND AND A POLITICAL COLLEAGUE FROM ARKANSAS, SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS JUST HOW CHALLENGING A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CAN BE TO BE A REPUBLICAN IN THAT STATE AND WHO IS, AS BOOB MENTIONED, THE FIRST-EVER ELECTED REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. AND A CLOSE FRIEND, TIM HUTCHINSON. I'M THRILLED HE'S HERE WITH ME THIS WEEKEND AND THE REST OF THE WEEK TO BE ON THE TRAIL WITH US. TIM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING AND BEING A PART OF THIS. MANY ANY ASK HIM WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RUN AS A REPUBLICAN IN ARKANSAS. AND HE'LL PROBABLY TELL YOU, AS I DO, IT'S LIKE BEING A FAIRLY HYDRANT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD FULL OF DOGS. THAT'S A PICTURE OF IT. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO SUSAN WHO IS SOMEWHERE HERE. I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE SHE'S GOING TO FIND US ANOTHER SPOT. SHE'S BEEN OUR CHAIR HERE. I SAID TO MANY PEOPLE, IF I HAD FIVE FOLKS JUST LIKE SUZZAN GETTIS, WE'D ABSOLUTELY WIN THIS THING, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION. I'VE NEVER BELIEVED IN HUMAN CLONING. I MAY MAKE AN EXCEPTION. I WANT YOU FOLKS IN INDIANOLA TO GIVE SUSAN A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN IN THE CAMPAIGN. IT'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE. AND JUST IN A FEW DAYS OUR TIME HERE IN IOWA FOR THE CAUCUSES IS GOING TO COME TO A CLOSE. I HEAR EVERY DAY ON TELEVISION PEOPLE SAY, WELL, THERE ARE A LOT OF UNDECIDED VOTERS. PEOPLE HAVEN'T YET MADE UP THEIR MINDS. WELL, TODAY I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE UP YOUR MINDS IS BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE SOME DECISIONS MADE. AS A NATION, WE ARE A DIVIDED AND POLARIZED NATION IN LARGE MEASURE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON HAVE DECIDED THAT THE WHOLE GAME IS ABOUT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES, THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. MOST PEOPLE THAT I SEE, EVEN IF THEY HAVE STRONG CONVICTIONS TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT AND MAY BE ENTRENCHED IN THEIR REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT POSITIONS AND CONVICTIONS, BEFORE THEY'RE ANYTHING ELSE THEY'RE AMERICANS. AND THEY BELIEVE IF WE DON'T MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY, BOTH IN THE POLITICAL REALM AS WELL AS IN HOW WE RUN GOVERNMENT IT REALLY WON'T MATTER IN ANOTHER GENERATION WHETHER WE CALL OURSELVES REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH OF AN AMERICA LEFT TO STILL BE FIGHTING FOR. $9 TRILLION OF DEBT HAS BEEN PUSHEDS DOWN OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN BECAUSE OF RECKLESS, IRRESPONSIBLE SPENDING IN CONGRESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATS ARE IN CHARGE OF CONGRESS. THEY'RE BOTH ADDICTED TO SPENDING IN THAT 1,000 EARMARKS WERE IN THIS LAST SPENDING. THE SPENDING NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT. THEY KNOW THAT AND WE KNOW THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY REALIZE THAT THEY'VE BEEN DYSFUNCTIONAL WHEN IT COMES TO SIMPLE THINGS TO FIX. BROKEN BORDERS WHERE IT'S EASIER NOW TO GET ACROSS THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER THAN IT IS TO GET ON AN AIRPLANE IN YOUR OWN HOMETOWN HAS CAUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BE ANGRY, NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE IMMIGRATING TO THIS COUNTRY, BUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ENFORCING A RULE OF LAW THAT WE WOULD HAVE A PROCESS TO WHICH PEOPLE CAN GO THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND DO IT LEGALLY. THE FACT IS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT FUNCTIONS AND THAT WORKS. I MEAN, EVERY DAY WE OUGHT TO GET DOWN ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES AND THANK GOD THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GET IN OUR COUNTRY AND NOT BREAK OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WHEN PEOPLE DO COME THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY DO IT THE RIGHT WAY AND LEGAL WAY RATHER THAN TO JUST COME ANYWAY WE WANT AND NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY ARE, AND IF THEY HAVE A BACKGROUND OR A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. THAT'S A RIGHT WE NEED TO KNOW. SO IT'S A MATTER ABOUT BEING FAIR, BEING APPROPRIATE. OUR TAX SYSTEM IS CREATING HAVOC FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WANTED TO START A SMALL BUSINESS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT 80% OF THE JOBS IN AMERICA COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS. THERE ARE A LOT OF MEN AND MANY, MANY WOMEN WHO START SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU START SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY SAT DOWN AT THEIR KITCHEN TABLE AND SKETCHED OUT AN IDEA ON THEIR NAPKIN AND SAID, I THINK THIS CAN WORK AND THEY MAY HAVE GOT THE COURAGED TOGETHER TO GO TO THE BANK AND BORROW SOME MONEY AND START THAT DREAM. AND YET THE SAD FACT IS FOR MANY MEN AND WOMEN WHO START A SMALL BUSINESS, THE GREATEST CHALLENGE AND THE TOUGHEST COMPE CITIES IS NOT THE COMPETITION THAT COMES FROM THE GUY ACROSS TOWN OUR ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR EVEN HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD, THE TOUGHEST COMPETITION THEY'RE GOING TO FACE IS FROM THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT WHOSE POLICIES OF TAXATION, REGULATION AND LITIGATION MAKES IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT SMALL BUSINESS A SUCCESS. THAT OUGHT TO CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZING PRODUCTIVITY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT OUR CURRENT TAX SYSTEM DOES. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO TINKER WITH THE TAX CODE AND SAYS, IT NEEDS A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT. NO IT, IT NEEDS A MAJOR OVERHAUL. WE SAY IN THE SOUTH, IF YOU CAN'T CONDUCT TAPE IT AND WD-40 IT, IT CAN BE FIXED. WITHLE, OUR TAX CODE CAN'T BE FIXED WITH CONDUCT TAPE AND WD- 406789 I SAY, LET'S GET RID OF OUR TAX CODE AND GET RICHARD OUR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND REPLACE IT WITH A TAX SYSTEM THAT'S FAMILY FRIENDLY. IT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY OUR ECONOMY FUNCTIONS. BRINGING $10 TRILLION OF WORKING CAPITAL BACK HOME, RESTORING MANUFACTURING JOBS, GIVING THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNER A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY SUCCEED AND CREATE THE KIND OF JOBS AND WEALTH THAT MAKES IT WORK. NOW I'M GETTING A LOT OF HAMMERING THESE DAYS FROM FOLKS ON WALL STREET THAT I DON'T THINK UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM. THEY THINK MY GOAL IS TO MAKE RICH PEOPLE POOR. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT POOR PEOPLE GET RICH AND WOULDN'T BE PUSHED TIME EVERY TIME THEY TRIED BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT WHOSE TAX POLICIES DON'T GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THAT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE TO A GOOD ECONOMY. AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOME SIGNIFICANT AND MAJOR CHANGES. TODAY THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, ACCORDING TO ONE THAT DID A POLL, FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE AFRAID OF AN AUDIT OF THE I.R.S. THAN THEY ARE OF GETTING MUGGED. THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE. NOW THINK ABOUT THAT. I THOUGHT, THAT'S GOT TO BE CRAZY. THEN I REALIZED, IF YOU GET MUGGED, IT WOULD ONLY LAST A FEW SECONDS. AND THEY CAN ONLY GET WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOU. THE I.R.S. COMES AFTER YOU, THEY'LL TAKE EVERYTHING YOU GOT AND WEAR YOU OUT FOR MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS, TO GET IT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED A NEW TAX CODE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT SOME SERIOUS ISSUES WE FACE IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. THOSE ARE PROBLEMS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT AROUND YOUR KITCHEN TABLE. AND SOMETIMES YOU TALK ABOUT IT AFTER YOU'VE PUT YOUR KIDS TO BED. AND WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER LISTENING BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SCARE THEM ABOUT THE FUTURE, YOU SIT AND TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HANDLE COLLEGE COSTS FOR THOSE KIDS. AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU HAVEN'T STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT, IF THEY'RE MORE THAN A FEW DAYS OLD, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SAVE, YOU HAVEN'T SAVED ENOUGH. HAVING GOTTEN THREE KIDS AND A WIFE THROUGH COLLEGE, I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT NO PARENT CAN TRULY AFFORD, COLLEGE AND CAR INSURANCE. THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YOU EVERY TIME. I THINK MARK TWAIN SAID WHEN A KID TURNS 1 YOU OUGHT TO PUT THEM IN A BARREL, POKE THE KID'S FOOD THROUGH THE HOLE. WHEN THE KID TURNS 1, COVER THE HOLE. AND HE SAID THAT BEFORE THERE WERE DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR 16-YEAR-OLDS. WAS HE NOT PRO FETIC? THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS THAT HAVE ANXIETY ABOUT THEIR KIDS. NO MATTER HOW HARD THOSE PARENTS WORK, THEY SEEM TO BE WORKING HARDER THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR. BECAUSE GAS PRICES ARE 70 CENTS A GALLON MORE, IT COSTS MORE TO GET TO SCHOOL AND WORK, IT MEANS YOU WOULDN'T DO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE LAST YEAR. BECAUSE HEALTH INSURANCE IS UP TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION, NO MATTER HOW MUCH HARDER YOU'RE WORKING THIS YEAR, YOU'RE NOT GETTING AHEAD. IF YOU'RE BARELY STAYING EVEN, YOU'RE LUCKY AND ONE OF THE FEW. SOME PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT INCREASINGLY HARD TO STAY WHERE THEY WERE A YEAR AGO. AND THEN IF YOU ADD TO THAT THE COST OF EDUCATION, THERE ARE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE BEING HAD LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP AS MOM AND DAD SAYS, WHAT KIND OF FUTURE FOR MY KIDS? WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR IN 1996 -- I HAD BEEN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOR THREE YEARS, SOMEWHAT OF AN AUDIT AT THE STATE CAPITOL, AS SENATOR HUTCHINSON CAN TELL YOU. THERE WERE SO THRILLED TO SEE ME THEY NAILED MY DOOR SHUT FROM THE INSIDELE AND IT STAYED SHUT FOR 59 DAYS THAT I WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I KNOW PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT -- I SAID, LITERALLY NAILED THE DOOR SHUT FROM THE NIGHT I FINALLY GOT IN BUT I WAS NOT WELCOMED WITH OPEN ARMS. MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS WHEN MY PREDECESSOR WAS FORCED TO RESIGN BECAUSE OF FELONY CONVICTIONS AND AS A RESULT I WAS THRUST INTO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN JULY OF 1996. I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS MY JOB AS GOVERNOR TO EVERYDAY WAKE UP AND ASK, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TODAY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE 7-YEAR-OLD KID LIVING IN DURHAMA, ARKANSAS? IT'S A SMALL TOWN IN THE ARKANSAS DELTA AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED REGION IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA REGION. AND THERE ARE INTENSE POCKETS OF POVERTY IN THAT MISSISSIPPI DELTA AREA. I COULD PICK THE NUMBER OF TOWNS. I KNEW PEOPLE THERE. I HAD THE PICTURE IN MY MIND OF A 7-YEAR-OLD KID EATING BREAK FAST THERE EVERY DAY. IN -- BREAKFAST THERE EVERY DAY. I SAID, WHAT'S GOING TO HELP THE KID? WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL IS HE GOING TO GO TO? WHAT KIND OF ROAD WILL HE DRIVE ON? WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CAN HE ACCESS? WHAT KIND OF JOB CAN HE EXPECT TO FIND WHEN HE'S OUT OF SCHOOL? AND WILL HIS EDUCATION, GIVEN THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY GET THOSE JOBS? WILL HE BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE BEAUTY OF WHAT WE CALL THE NATURAL STATE? THAT'S OUR STATE'S MOTTO. AND I TRIED TO MAKE DECISIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THINK OF HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THAT 7-YEAR-OLD BOY IN ARKANSAS. WE TOOK ON CHANGING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND REFORMING IT. WE INCREASED TEACHER PAY AND WE ASKED MORE FROM THE TEACHERS AND WE GOT IT. AND THE RESULT WAS, NOT ONLY DID THEY GO FROM THE LOWEST PAID TEACHERS, ALMOST IN THE NATION, TO THE HIGHEST PAID IN THE REGION, BUT WE SAW OUR TEST SCORES IMPROVE IN EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY FROM THE TIME THAT WE RAISED STANDARDS AND HAD ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW KIND OF PARTNERSHIP WHERE PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WERE ALL INVOLVED IN TRYING TO MAKE IT ABOUT THE STUDENTS, NOT JUST ABOUT THE SCHOOLS. THE CORRECT FOUNDATION SAID WE DID MORE IN FIVE YEARS THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THE PREVIOUS 50 YEARS TO REFORM EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. WE HAD A ROAD SYSTEM THAT WAS THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO TRUCKER'S MAGAZINE THEY SAID IT WAS THE WORST. THOSE GUYS OUGHT TO KNOW. I WASN'T PROUD OF THAT. NEITHER WERE THE PEOPLE IN MY STATE. AND THEY KNEW IT CAUSED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF EXTRA DAMAGE TO THEIR CARS EACH YEAR AND I SAID, LET'S HAVE A ROAD SYSTEM THAT WILL BE SAFE FOR OUR KIDS AND SOMETHING WE CAN BE PROUD OF. AND WE REBUILT OUR ROAD SYSTEM AND BRIDGES AND FIVE YEARS LATER THE SAME MAGAZINE SAID WE HAD THE MORE IMPROVED ROAD SYSTEM. IF CAN I GET AN 80% RATE ON CAUCUS NIGHT I WOULD LIKE THAT. WE CHANGED HEALTH CARE BECAUSE A LOT OF KIDS IN OUR STATE DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH TO AFFORD ACCESS TO A DOCTOR. SO THEY WOULD GET SICK AND GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, WHICH WAS REALLY EXPENSIVE. WE CREATED THE OUR KIDS FIRST PROGRAM. PARENTS FADE. IT WASN'T WELFARE. IT WAS A PARTNERSHIP AND THE STATE MADE IT POSSIBLE SO THAT ANY PARENT, WORKING-CLASS PARENT COULD GO TO THE DOCTOR AND HAVE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND BE TAKEN CARE OF WITH MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE. THAT LITTLE KID IN DURINGMONT, IF HE HAS A TOOTHACHE AND STOMACH ACHE, IF HE'S NOT HEALTHY HE'S NOT LEARNING. YOU CAN'T SEPARATE DECENT HEALTH CARE AND DECENT EDUCATION. IT WASN'T A HANDOUT. WE REFORMED WELFARE. AND WE MOVED 50% OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON WELFARE OUT OF WELFARE AND INTO JOBS. WE HAD THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF JOBS AND THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA JOBS COME TO THAT STATE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. I SAW A $200 MILLION DEFICIT TO BECOME A $850 MILLION PLUS. -- SURPLUS. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO THE MAILBOX AND SAY, HERE ARE ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT MIKE HUCKABEE DID. EVERY TIME YOU TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION YOU ARE GOING TO SEE ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT MY OPPONENTS SAY I DID. YOU HAVE A WASHINGTON GROUP TELLING YOU THAT I'M A BUM. MITT ROMNEY'S EVERY DAY, FLOODING YOUR TELEVISION SETS TELLING YOU I'M A BUM. I COULD HAVE SAVED THOSE GUYS A LOT OF MONEY. MY WIFE COULD HAVE COME TO IOWA. SHE'S HERE IN IOWA. SHE WOULD TELL YOU FOR FREERKS I'M A BUM. [LAUGHTER] >> BUT I TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE SHE'S TELLING PEOPLE TODAY IN IOWA, SHE'S TELLING THEM, THAT I SERVE MY PEOPLE. AND THAT I NEVER FORGOT WHY I WAS GOVERNOR. AND IT WASN'T ABOUT ADVANCING MY CAREER. IT WAS ABOUT ADVANCING THE FUTURE AND THE LIFE OF THAT 7-YEAR-OLD KID IN DURMONT. I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INCREDIBLY DESPERATE AND FRANKLY DISHONEST THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT ME. YESTERDAY IT GOT EVEN WORSE. SOME VERY DISHONEST AND DESPERATE THINGS SAID ABOUT ONE OF MY RIVALS IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR PRESIDENT. AS MITT ROMNEY NOT ONLY IS NOW ATTACKING ME, BUT HE'S ATTACKING JOHN MCCAIN. JOHN MCCAIN AND I ARE RUNNING FOR THE SAME JOB. ONE OF US WILL WIN, ONE OF US WON'T. BUT I WILL TELL YOU I WON'T ATTACK HIM. HE'S A GREAT AND HONEST AND HONORABLE AMERICAN. AS I'M GETTING ATTACKED, I JUST FINALLY DECIDED YESTERDAY, HE'S NOW ATTACKED JOHN MCCAIN, RUDY GIULIANI, HE'S ATTACKED EVERYBODY. HE'S NOT TELLING PEOPLE WHY HE OUGHT TO BE PRESIDENT. HE'S ONLY TELLING PEOPLE WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE PRESIDENT. AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. AND TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE TRUTH REALLY IS. BECAUSE YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THAT TRUTH IS. AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE ONE DAY, ONE OF US IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AND YOU ARE GOING TO TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION SOME NIGHT AND THE ANNOUNCER WILL SAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND I HOPE YOUR HEAD WILL TURN TO THE TELEVISION AND WILL BE WATCHING ONE OF US SPEAK AND I HOPE IT IS ME. I BELIEVE IT WILL BE. AND THIS WEEK IT WILL BE. AND WHEN THAT CAMERA COMES ON, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE AND TELLING YOU THE TRUTH, WHETHER IT'S ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY OR ABOUT THE WAR OR WHETHER IT'S ABOUT THE TAX SYSTEM, OR WHETHER IT'S ABOUT THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND WHY WE NEED TO PROTECT IT AND VALUE IT. AND IT NEEDS TO BE SPOKEN OF CONVICTION. IT NEEDS TO BE SPOKEN WITH CLARITY BECAUSE THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT JOB OF THE PRESIDENT OTHER THAN BEING THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF OUR MILITARY FORCES IS TO BE THE COMMUNICATOR IN CHIEF OF OUR HEART AND OUR SOUL AND TO REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. [APPLAUSE] AND IF A PERSON BECOMES PRESIDENT BY BEING DISHONEST, NOW JUST REMEMBER, THAT IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT HE WILL LIKELY NOT START BEING HONEST IN THE JOB IF HE HAD BEEN DISHONEST TO GET THERE. IF YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT MIKE HUCKABEE HAD THIS HUGE BUDGET EXPANS, LET ME TELL YOU, ""NEW YORK TIMES"" TODAY HAD AN ARTICLE THAT SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND IN FACT POINTED OUT THAT THE BUDGET INCREASE IN MY STATE WAS ABOUT 3.9% EACH YEAR OVER THE 10-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH WAS COMPARABLE TO ANYBODY'S, INCLUDING MITT ROMNEY. THE FACT THAT WE HAD A MAJOR ACCOUNTING CHANGE WHERE WE CHANGED OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, WHICH IS A LOT OF INSIDE BASEBALL STUFF. BUT THE POINT BEING THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY EVEN LESS THAN THAT ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR THINGS THAT I RAISED TAXES. WHAT YOU WON'T HEAR THEM SAY IS THAT I CUT 94 TAXES INCLUDING THE MARRIAGE PENALTY. WE REDUCED PROPERTY TAXES, PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER PEOPLE TO KEEP THOSE HOMES AND WE CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAXES. WE PUT A NEW THRESHOLD WHEN PEOPLE PAY TAXES SO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE POOREST COULDN'T GET SUCKED INTO A TAX SYSTEM THAT THEY COULDN'T AFFORD. WE HELPED THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A GOOD TAX POLICY COULD DO. I UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT WAS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP. I DIDN'T GROW UP WITH A LAST NAME THAT OPENED A DOOR. IN FACT, MY LAST NAME ACTUALLY CLOSED A FEW. THE RENT SIGN WE HAD ON OR YARD SAID, -- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CARED. NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I EVER REMEMBER SOMEBODY ASKING MY DAD WOULD HE BE COMING OUT AND ENDORSING A CANDIDATE. HIS OPINION DIDN'T MATTER. HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER FOR THE CITY OF HOPE, ARKANSAS. AND ON HIS DAYS OFF A MECHANIC REBUILDING CAR GENERATORS IN A LITTLE SHOP HE HAD. MY DAD GOT DIRTY EVERY DAY DOING WHAT HE DID, LIFTING HEAVY THINGS. NEVER HAD A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. AND NOBODY UPSTREAM FROM ME AS A MALE HAS EVER, FAR AS WE CAN LOOK, EVEN GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. MY SON SAID, DON'T LOOK TOO FAR UP THAT FAMILY TREE. THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE BUT AS FAR UP AS I EVER LOOKED, NO MALE HAD EVER GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS THE FIRST. AND CERTAINLY THE FIRST TO GO ON TO COLLEGE. MY MOTHER GREW UP AS A LITTLE GIRL WITH DIRT FLOORS, OUTDOOR TOILETS. SHE UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING OF POVERTY AS MY PARENTS BECAME PART OF WHAT WE CALLED THE GREATEST GENERATION. WE CALL THEM THE GREATEST GENERATION BECAUSE THEY MADE THE GREATEST SACRIFICES FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THAT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE EVER BEEN DONE. IT WASN'T ABOUT THEM. IT WAS ABOUT THEIR KIDS. AND THEY MADE SURE THAT WE HAD A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY EVER COULD HAVE DREAMED. AND BECAUSE OF THEIR SACRIFICES TODAY WE ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF A MARVELOUS COUNTRY. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE DONE AS MUCH FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AS OUR PARENTS GENERATION DID FOR US. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE. AND THAT'S NOT ABOUT THE HORIZONTAL LEFT-RIGHT POLITICS OF THE DAY THAT POLARIZES PEOPLE. IT OUGHT TO BE THE KIND THE POLITICS THAT BRINGS US BACK TOGETHER. AND REGARDLESS WHERE YOU ARE ON THE SCALE YOU NEED TO REALIZE THAT AMERICA IS TOO IMPORTANT TO LET THE DESPERATE AND DISHONEST POLITICS KEEPING YOU FROM HAVING REAL LEADERSHIP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, REAL LEADERSHIP THAT WILL TAKE THIS COUNTRY TO THE PLACE WHERE THAT 7-YEAR-OLD KID IN DURMONT, ARKANSAS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT ABOUT THOSE OF US THAT ARE ADULTS. ABOUT THE KIDS OUT THERE THAT WE OWE THE BEST TO, NOT THE WORST. AND I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT THAT CARES ABOUT THAT KID IN DURMONT AND CARES ABOUT THE KID IN INDIANOLA. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SUEDE BY SOME COMPLETELY, ABSOLUTELY, OFFTHE CHART THINGS THAT ARE BEING SAID ON TELEVISION ADS THAT AREN'T TRUE. LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT I COMMUTED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN ARKANSAS. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, I HAD 8,700 REQUESTS ON MY DESK. 97% OF THEM I TURNED THEM DOWN. BUT I DID GRANT A FEW. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER FOR ME TO SAY NO TO ALL OF THEM. MITT ROMNEY SAID NO TO EVERY ONE OF THEM BUT HE ONLY HAD 100 REQUESTS COMPARED TO 8,700 ON MINE. BUT THE OTHER THING I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT SOMETIMES THOSE REQUESTS, IS NOT AS HE PORTRAYS THEM TO BE. LET ME GIVE YOU A CASE AND SEE WHAT YOU WOULD DO. ONE OF THEM WAS, YOUNG MAN WHO WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE, HE WAS WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD AND HE DID. HE WENT TO IRAQ AND SERVED IN COMBAT. FOUGHT IN THE SUNNI TRIANGLE, RECEIVED THE BRONZE STAR FOR HIS COMBAT ACTION. HE CAME BACK FROM WAR HAVING EDUCATED HIMSELF IN COLLEGE, SIGNED UP AS A VOLUNTEER IN THE NATIONAL GUARD, FROM COMBAT HE CAME AND HE WANTED TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. WHEN HE HAD BEEN 13 YEARS OLD HE HAD SHOT A FRIEND IN THE ARM WITH A B.B. GUN. NOW IT DIDN'T BREAK THE SKIN. BUT IT WAS ON HIS RECORD. AS A RESULT OF THAT HE COULDN'T GET INTO THE ACADEMY TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER. SO HE APPLIED FOR A PARDON SO HE COULD GET THAT OFF HIS RECORD AND FULFILL HIS DREAM TO BE A POLICEMAN. TWICE THE STATE'S PAROLE BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT HE GET A PARDON. NOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THAT CASE WERE ON YOUR DESK GIVEN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES? HE'S FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. HE STOOD IN FRONT OF A BULLET FOR YOU AND ME. NOW HE WANTS TO COME BACK AND BE A FRONTLINE SOLDIER FOR THE WAR ON CRIME. HOW MANY WOULD NOT GIVE HIM THE PARDON? WOULD ANY OF YOU SAY, NO? OK. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS. YOU HAVE JUST AGREED TO WHAT I WOULD HAVE AGREED TO. BY THE WAY, I -- THAT WAS A CASE MITT ROMNEY HAD. MITT ROMNEY SAID NO TO THAT CASE TWICE. AND THAT YOUNG MAN DIDN'T GET TO BE A POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY MADE THE DECISION THAT HIS POLITICAL FUTURE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANTHONY'S FUTURE TO BE A POLICE OFFICER DESPITE WHAT HE HAD DONE TO HIS COUNTRY. ANOTHER CASE, 26-YEAR-OLD WANTS TO GO TO CULINARY SCHOOL TO BECOME A CHEF. HE CAN'T GET IN BECAUSE THE FACT THAT AT 18 YEARS OLD A FRIEND OF HIS CAME BY AND PICKED HIM UP. TURNED OUT THE CAR WAS STOLEN WHEN THE POLICE PULLED HIM OVER. THE DRIVER GOT ARRESTED FOR A STOLEN CAR. HE GOT ARRESTED FOR BEING AN ACCESSORY. HE WAS WRONG. NEVER SERVED A DAY IN JAIL BUT HE DID HAD TO PAY A FINE. BUT IT'S ON HIS RECORD. NOW HE CAN'T GET INTO SCHOOL. HE WANTS A PARDON SO HE CAN GO TO SCHOOL, FULFILL HIS DREAM TO BE A CHEF. BOARD RECOMMENDS PARDON. WHAT DO YOU DO? HOW MANY SAY GIVE HIM THE PARDON? SEE YOUR HANDS. OK. HOW MANY SAY, DON'T GIVE HIM THE PARDON, JUST LET HIM STAY UNEMPLOYED? NO HANDS. I DON'T SEE A ONE. WELL, THAT CASE WAS ON MY DESK AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THAT MITT ROMNEY ACCUSES ME OF BEING LIGHT ON AND SAYING I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE. THE 16 PEOPLE THAT I CARRIED OUT AN EXECUTION IN ARKANSAS WOULD HARDY SAY I WAS SOFT ON CRIME. THAT'S NO OTHER PERSON THAT ANYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT EVER HAD TO DO. IF HE WOULD DO A LITTLE FACT CHECKING IN 1999 WE DOUBLED THE SENTENCES FOR METH AND METH LABS WENT DOWN 48% DURING MY YEAR AS TENURE. METH PENALTIES IN MY STATE WERE FOUR TIMES HARSHER THAN THEY WERE IN MITT ROMNEY'S MASSACHUSETTS. SO WHEN HE TELLS YOU I WAS SOFT ON CRIME AND SOFT ON METHAMPHETAMINE, A LITTLE FACT CHECKING WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE CLEARER FOR YOU AND FOR ME. WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST ELECTING SOMEBODY WHO CAN RUN SOME CLEVER ADS. YOU'RE ELECTING SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO SHOOT STRAIGHT WITH YOU IF THEY'RE ELECTED. IF THEY LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND SAY YOUR KIDS NEED TO GO AND FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE TELLING YOU AN HONEST REASON WHY AND SOMETHING YOU CAN TRUST AND BELIEVE IN. IF A PRESIDENT SITS DOWN AND TELLS YOU THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO CHANGE ITS TAX CODE YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT'S TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. IF A PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED TO BECOME INDEPENDENT OF ENERGY SOURCES THAT WE DON'T HAVE AND HAVE OUR OWN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, AND HERE'S HOW WE CAN GET THERE, YOU NEED TO BELIEVE THAT HE AT LEAST BELIEVES THAT IT'S GOING TO GET DONE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO GET DONE. IF THAT PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE FROM THE TIME OF CONCEPTION BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO OUR CIVILIZATION THAN THE RESPECT OF HUMAN LIFE BECAUSE OF THE INTRINSIC WORTH AND VALUE OF EVERY HUMAN LIFE, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT PRESIDENT ACTUALLY BELIEVES IT AND WHEN HE GETS IN OFFICE THAT HE'LL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AS I DID IN THE GOVERNOR IN ARKANSAS SIGNING PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION TIME AND TIME AGAIN. YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR PRESIDENT REALLY MEANS IT. YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT YOUR PRESIDENT REALLY BELIEVES THAT TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ONLY HOW WE BRING OUR KIDS IN THIS WORLD BUT THAT'S HOW WE TRAIN OUR FAMILY. AND GOVERNMENT SHUNNED UNDERMINE OUR BASIC FAMILY PRINCIPLES. IT OUGHT TO UNDERGIRD THOSE FAMILY PRINCIPLESES. IT OUGHT TO HELP YOU AS A MOM AND DAD TO MAKE CHANGES ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND FUTURE. IN A FEW DAYS YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DECISION. THE REPERCUSSIONS OF YOUR DECISION LITERALLY WILL BE FELT AROUND THE WORLD. I'M NOT BEING MELODRAMATIC ABOUT THAT. THE WORLD'S EYES WILL BE ON IOWA ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 3. AND HERE'S WHY. WHEN PEOPLE LOOKING IN AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IOWA, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE THIS PRESIDENTIAL PROCESS IS REALLY GOING. NOW MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS PEOPLE THAT'S NOT BEING OUTSPENT OF 20 -1 CAN BE PRESIDENT. AND MITT ROMNEY IS OUTSPENDING ME 20-1 IN THIS STATE. IT WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF THIS COUNTRY IF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA SAID WE WILL NOT BE BOUGHT, WE WILL NOT EVEN BE RENTED, WE WILL MAKE UP OUR OWN DECISIONS AND WE WILL VOTE FOR SOMEBODY FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT HE BELIEVES LIKE WE BELIEVE AND LIKE THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO GO. AND THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU TO GO OUT ON CAUCUS NIGHT AND NOT ONLY VOTE FOR ME BUT DON'T GO ALONE. AND WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE ON CAUCUS NIGHT, TAKE FOLKS WITH YOU, FRIENDS, RELATIVES, ASSOCIATES FROM WORK, NEIGHBORS, WHOEVER IT IS, TAKE THEM WITH YOU. IF YOU HAVE NEIGHBORS THAT SAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, THEN YOU DON'T LET THEM OUT OF THEIR HOUSE, OK? SHOVEL SNOW IN THEIR DRIVEWAYS. TELL THEM THE ORANGE BOWL IS REALLY, REALLY WORTH WATCHING THAT NIGHT. I DON'T CARE. NOW IF YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE WILLING TO VOTE FOR ME, DON'T LET THEM STAY HOME. IN FACT, CALL SOME FOLKS UP AND SAY, HEY, THE WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING. WE WANT TO TAKE YOU GUYS OUT TO DINNER. HONK THE HORN. WHEN THEY POP IN THE BACKSEAT, TOSS THEM A BALONEY SANDWICH SAY, EAT QUICK. CAUCUS STARTS IN 0 MINUTES. GET OUT AND GET THE VOTES COUNTED. WE MAY NOT V THE MONEY BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE HEART OF PEOPLE IN IOWA WHO BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OUGHT NOT TO GET THERE BECAUSE OF HAD THE MOST MONEY BUT BECAUSE HE HAD THE KIND OF IDEAS THAT WOULD AFFECT THE LIFE OF THE 7-YEAR-OLD KID HAVING BREAKFAST IN DURMONT, ARKANSAS, AS WELL AS THE ONE HAVING BREAKFAST IN INDIANOLA, IOWA. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ON CAUCUS NIGHT. NEED YOU OUT THERE. AND I HOPE YOU'LL GIVE US YOUR VOTE, YOUR SUPPORT. CALL, EMAIL, WRITE, AND GO SEE EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. LET'S HAVE AN INCREDIBLE VICTORY THAT PUTS THE WORLD ON ITS EAR COME JANUARY 3. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> I KNOW ABOUT ME, I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM BECOME OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, WE HAVE COMMITMENT CARDS, AS YOU LEAVE HERE OUT OF THIS RESTAURANT. IF THERE'S A SUPPORTER RIGHT THERE. IF YOU WOULD SIGN UP AND LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE. AND GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE SAID, TAKE FRIENDS, TAKE NEIGHBORS, YOU CAN HAVE A VOICE. AS THE WORLD SETS THE SIGHTS ON IDEA, LET THEM KNOW THAT A MESSAGE IS BEING SENT. VOTE MIKE HUCKABEE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> COME HERE, THERE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

IT TREATS EVERY CHILD WITH INDIVIDUAL RESPECT BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED IN IT. THE TEST SCORES CAN BE SKEWED. IF YOU HAVE DAYS PROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF KIDS ON E.S.L. ARE YOU A TEACHER? >> MY WIFE IS. >> MY SISTER IS AND HAS BEEN FOR 3 YEARS. THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT THE CONCEPT IS FLAWED. THE CONCEPT IS EVERY STUDENT IS TREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL. THAT'S GREAT. >> RIGHT. >> IT'S A MATTER OF TWEAKING THOSE POINTS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC, MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE TESTING THAT YOU COVER THE BROAD SPECTRUM. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS A LOT OF SCHOOLS HAVE CUT OUT THE ARTS AND MUSIC. THAT'S CRITICAL TO A STUDENT'S SUCCESS. >> YOU NEED TO REVISIT IT AND REVISE IT. >> AND MAKE IT BETTER. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET RID OF IT. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF CARING ABOUT EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD. >> APPRECIATE IT. >> WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE TEACH? >> FIRST GRADE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD LUCK. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> THREE PEOPLE BACK THERE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING SMOTHERED OUT THERE. >> SHE LOVES ATTENTION. DON'T BELIEVE HER. >> SHE HAS A POLITICAL FUTURE, RIGHT? >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> STEVEN. >> YOU HAVE A GOOD SMILE. WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT TODAY? >> THAT I GOT TO SEE YOU. >> LISTEN AT YOU. THANK YOU. DID YOUR MOM OR DAD TELL YOU TO SAY THAT OR DID YOU COME WITH THAT BY YOURSELF? >> MY DAD. >> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU REALLY GOT HIM TRAINED WELL. >> MIKE HUCKABEE. APPRECIATE YOU COMING TODAY. >> BE THERE TO VOTE FOR YOU. >> THANK YOU. AND YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAD.

REPUBLICANS. 72 VOTES. NEXT WAS JOHN MCCAIN FOR 22. SO THAT TELLS YOU HOW BIG A DIFFERENCE. >> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANY. OK, TRISH. ARE YOU ABLE TO COME WITH ME THE NEXT FEW DAYS? >> SURE. >> WE MIGHT HAVE TO THROW YOU ON THE BUS? >> OK. >> SO YOU MUST HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH. >> YEAH. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> MIKE HUCKABEE. >> CRAIG. TRISHA'S DAD. >> I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF HER AS I AM. >> I AM. >> THIS WILL BE HER FIRST CAUCUS. SHE'S 18. >> ARE YOU, REALLY? I WANT TO BE YOUR FIRST VOTE. THAT WOULD BE A REAL HONOR FOR ME, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT YOU GOT ME ELECTED IN YOUR SCHOOL. >> YEAH. >> GOOD WORK. THANK YOU, TRISH. >> I'LL TRY TO GET THERE SOMEHOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

THEY SHOULD BE BACK WITH THEIR FAMILY AND EVERYTHING AND ALL -- I CAN TELL YOU THIS, I'VE HEARD THIS AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH BECAUSE I TOOK GOVERNMENT IN MY FIRST SEMESTER IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT IS THAT EVERYBODY IS WANTING TO -- ALL GEORGE W. BUSH IS WANTING TO DO IS TAKE THE -- HAVE THE MONEY. FOR THE OIL THAT'S OVER THERE. THAT'S ALL HE'S WANTING. AND WE -- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT DOES THAT. >> I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IT FOR THE OIL. I THINK HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE HE REALLY WANTS TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR AMERICA. I KNOW PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE WITH HIM AND BE GREAT AMERICANS. I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S DOING IT FOR A DISHONORABLE REASON. I KNOW HIM. I'VE BEEN TO IRAQ AND I'VE VISITED OUR TROOPS THERE. AND I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY'RE GETTING DONE AND HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT A BETTER PLACE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK THERE AND FIGHT IT AGAIN. >> I MEAN, BECAUSE -- OSAMA BIN LADEN -- SADDAM -- SADDAM HUSSEIN WASN'T PART OF IT, YOU KNOW? THE ONLY PERSON PART OF IT WAS THE 9/11 ATTACKERS. >> WELL, I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTED, AND EVEN THE DEMOCRATS AGREED WITH HIM WHEN HE TOOK OUR TROOPS THERE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO YOU. I RESPECT YOUR VIEW. IT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA A GREAT PLACE. YOU CAN HAVE TOTAL DISAGREEMENT AND CAN'T GET ARRESTED FOR DISAGREEING WITH A POLITICS. >> HAVE A GREAT DAY. >> I HOPE SO. THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN. >> YOU BET. >> I'M ABOUT TO GET THE HANG OF IT. I TELL YOU THE BEST PART, THAT DOG WE HAD WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

TERRIBLE FOR ME. I'LL PROBABLY DREAD THIS WHOLE THING. I'M SURE I WILL. >> C-SPAN. >> GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. THERE'S TIGHT QUARTERS OUT HERE. MAYBE WE'LL THIN IT OUT IN A MINUTE. HOW YOU GUYS DOING? >> GOOD. >> APPRECIATE Y'ALL COMING OUT TODAY. >> YOU BET. >> HI. GOOD FOR YOU.",2015-11-07 17:07:35,2007-12-29,Indianola,Iowa

GOOD TO SEE YOU, GUYS. >> NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. >> I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. HI. JACKIE, HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> HI. >> HOPE YOU BROUGHT WARM CLOTHES. >> HI THERE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> ANDRE. >> NICE TO MEET YOU, ANDRE. EMILY, DID YOU COME HERE ALL BY YOURSELF OR DID YOU DRIVE YOUR MOTHER? >> YEAH. >> THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED. CAN I SEE YOUR LICENSE? >> I DON'T HAVE IT ON ME RIGHT NOW. >> YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD. YOU HAVE A FUTURE IN POLITICS. YOU DODGED THAT VERY WELL. OK. THIS WHERE WE ARE? GOODNESS. NO, YOU'RE FINE. [APPLAUSE] >> WELL, GOOD MORNING, INDIANOLA. AND NOW I GUESS IT'S AFTERNOON, INDIANOLA, HUH? WELL, ISN'T IT GREAT TO BE IN IOWA? WE ARE IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE WORLD'S ATTENTION AND THE COUNTRY'S ATTENTION, TO SEE WHO WE'RE GOING TO SELECT AS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT. AND BEFORE I INTRODUCE THE MAN OF THE HOUR, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A COUPLE OF GUESTS THAT ARE TRAVELING WITH US. FIRST OF ALL, JIM GILCHREST WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF THE MINUTEMEN. YOU RECOGNIZE HIM. [APPLAUSE] WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE HIS ENDORSEMENT, LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. AND FORMER GOVERNOR TIM HUTCHINSON, THE FIRST REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS. HELP ME -- [APPLAUSE] IN THE 2006 CAMPAIGN, DARLA AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET ALL OF THE 2008 CANDIDATES. AND BACK IN JANUARY WHEN WE ENDORSED GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE AND I AGREED TO BE HIS IOWA STATE CHAIRMAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID, WHY MIKE HUCKABEE? HE'S AN ASTERISK IN THE POLLS. NOBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS. AND DARLA AND I SAID, HE'S A GUY THAT'S CAPABLE. ""TIME"" MAGAZINE SAID THAT HE'S THE BEST GOVERNOR. HE'S A GUY THAT FEARS GOD. WE SAY THAT HE'S A GUY THAT -- YOU BET. WE SAID HE'S A GUY THAT'S TRUSTWORTHY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE SAID WE KNOW HE'S TRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT WHAT HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO AND DID WHAT HE SAID. AND HE'S NOT HERE ABOUT DISABLING HIS OPPONENTS. HE'S TALKING ABOUT A VISION OF AMERICA, ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND NO LONGER IS HE AN ASTERISK IN THE STATE OF IOWA. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE MEDIA USED TO SAY THAT HE WAS SECOND TIER. AND THEN HE SAID HE WAS TIER AND A HALF. AND THEN HE SAID HE'S TOP TIER. BUT THEY HAVE A NEW NAME FOR HIM NOW IN IOWA. AND TODAY THEY CALL HIM FRONTRUNNER IN THE STATE OF IOWA. [APPLAUSE] SO ON JANUARY 3, I WANT YOU TO JOIN ME AND MY FAMILY TO GO OUT AND CAUCUS AND SEND A MESSAGE TO THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT THE MEDIA DOESN'T TELL US WHO OUR CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO BE, MONEY DOESN'T BUY OUR CANDIDATE, BUT IT'S THE MESSAGE AND THE MESSENGER THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR CANDIDATE AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO BE GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] SO PLEASE DO ME A GREAT FAVOR AND WELCOME A GOVERNOR FROM HOPE, ARKANSAS, WHO ISN'T GOING TO MARY HILLARY CLINTON, BUT A GOVERNOR FROM HOPE, ARKANSAS, THAT'S GOING TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BOB. THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING. I DON'T THINK THIS ROOM WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO HOLD THIS MANY PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO TEST THE CAPACITY OF THE FLOOR. SO IF ANYBODY HEARS ANY CRACKING GOING ON, WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW? YOU CAN FOLLOW ME OUT THE DOOR. SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY. I KNOW THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION. SOME READ THE PAPER. THE PAPER SAID 1:00 START TIME. WE LET FOLKS KNOW IT'S NOON. SO IF THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER SHIFT COMING, SAY IT WAS A GREAT RALEY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE. I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING EARLIER IN THE SUMMER AND WE WERE REALLY BLESSED AND FELT KIND OF FLATTERED WHEN SOMEONE TOOK A PHOTO WITH A CELL PHONE. AND TODAY YOU CAN SEE THINGS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THE INTEREST OF THE CAMPAIGN. SO I'M TRULY GRATEFUL. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO BOB, OUR CAMPAIGN CHAIR HERE IN IOWA. I SAY EVERYWHERE I GO, I HOPE HE'S GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF IOWA. ALSO MY THANKS TO JIM GILL CHEST, FOUNDER OF THE MINUTEMEN PROJECT, FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT, FOR ALSO THE WORK HE'S DOING TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OUR PLAN ON DEALING WITH THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S CONCERNED A LOT OF PEOPLE. WE THINK IT OUGHT TO BE HANDLED WITH A RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO BE HANDLED IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR TO EVERYBODY. AND JIM HAS BEEN A GREAT RESOURCE FOR US. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS BEING ON THE TRAIL WITH US TODAY. AS WELL AS A LONG-TIME FRIEND AND A POLITICAL COLLEAGUE FROM ARKANSAS, SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS JUST HOW CHALLENGING A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CAN BE TO BE A REPUBLICAN IN THAT STATE AND WHO IS, AS BOOB MENTIONED, THE FIRST-EVER ELECTED REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. AND A CLOSE FRIEND, TIM HUTCHINSON. I'M THRILLED HE'S HERE WITH ME THIS WEEKEND AND THE REST OF THE WEEK TO BE ON THE TRAIL WITH US. TIM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING AND BEING A PART OF THIS. MANY ANY ASK HIM WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RUN AS A REPUBLICAN IN ARKANSAS. AND HE'LL PROBABLY TELL YOU, AS I DO, IT'S LIKE BEING A FAIRLY HYDRANT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD FULL OF DOGS. THAT'S A PICTURE OF IT. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO SUSAN WHO IS SOMEWHERE HERE. I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE SHE'S GOING TO FIND US ANOTHER SPOT. SHE'S BEEN OUR CHAIR HERE. I SAID TO MANY PEOPLE, IF I HAD FIVE FOLKS JUST LIKE SUZZAN GETTIS, WE'D ABSOLUTELY WIN THIS THING, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION. I'VE NEVER BELIEVED IN HUMAN CLONING. I MAY MAKE AN EXCEPTION. I WANT YOU FOLKS IN INDIANOLA TO GIVE SUSAN A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN IN THE CAMPAIGN. IT'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE. AND JUST IN A FEW DAYS OUR TIME HERE IN IOWA FOR THE CAUCUSES IS GOING TO COME TO A CLOSE. I HEAR EVERY DAY ON TELEVISION PEOPLE SAY, WELL, THERE ARE A LOT OF UNDECIDED VOTERS. PEOPLE HAVEN'T YET MADE UP THEIR MINDS. WELL, TODAY I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE UP YOUR MINDS IS BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE SOME DECISIONS MADE. AS A NATION, WE ARE A DIVIDED AND POLARIZED NATION IN LARGE MEASURE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON HAVE DECIDED THAT THE WHOLE GAME IS ABOUT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES, THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. MOST PEOPLE THAT I SEE, EVEN IF THEY HAVE STRONG CONVICTIONS TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT AND MAY BE ENTRENCHED IN THEIR REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT POSITIONS AND CONVICTIONS, BEFORE THEY'RE ANYTHING ELSE THEY'RE AMERICANS. AND THEY BELIEVE IF WE DON'T MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY, BOTH IN THE POLITICAL REALM AS WELL AS IN HOW WE RUN GOVERNMENT IT REALLY WON'T MATTER IN ANOTHER GENERATION WHETHER WE CALL OURSELVES REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH OF AN AMERICA LEFT TO STILL BE FIGHTING FOR. $9 TRILLION OF DEBT HAS BEEN PUSHEDS DOWN OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN BECAUSE OF RECKLESS, IRRESPONSIBLE SPENDING IN CONGRESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATS ARE IN CHARGE OF CONGRESS. THEY'RE BOTH ADDICTED TO SPENDING IN THAT 1,000 EARMARKS WERE IN THIS LAST SPENDING. THE SPENDING NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT. THEY KNOW THAT AND WE KNOW THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY REALIZE THAT THEY'VE BEEN DYSFUNCTIONAL WHEN IT COMES TO SIMPLE THINGS TO FIX. BROKEN BORDERS WHERE IT'S EASIER NOW TO GET ACROSS THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER THAN IT IS TO GET ON AN AIRPLANE IN YOUR OWN HOMETOWN HAS CAUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BE ANGRY, NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE IMMIGRATING TO THIS COUNTRY, BUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ENFORCING A RULE OF LAW THAT WE WOULD HAVE A PROCESS TO WHICH PEOPLE CAN GO THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND DO IT LEGALLY. THE FACT IS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT FUNCTIONS AND THAT WORKS. I MEAN, EVERY DAY WE OUGHT TO GET DOWN ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES AND THANK GOD THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GET IN OUR COUNTRY AND NOT BREAK OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WHEN PEOPLE DO COME THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY DO IT THE RIGHT WAY AND LEGAL WAY RATHER THAN TO JUST COME ANYWAY WE WANT AND NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY ARE, AND IF THEY HAVE A BACKGROUND OR A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. THAT'S A RIGHT WE NEED TO KNOW. SO IT'S A MATTER ABOUT BEING FAIR, BEING APPROPRIATE. OUR TAX SYSTEM IS CREATING HAVOC FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WANTED TO START A SMALL BUSINESS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT 80% OF THE JOBS IN AMERICA COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS. THERE ARE A LOT OF MEN AND MANY, MANY WOMEN WHO START SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU START SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY SAT DOWN AT THEIR KITCHEN TABLE AND SKETCHED OUT AN IDEA ON THEIR NAPKIN AND SAID, I THINK THIS CAN WORK AND THEY MAY HAVE GOT THE COURAGED TOGETHER TO GO TO THE BANK AND BORROW SOME MONEY AND START THAT DREAM. AND YET THE SAD FACT IS FOR MANY MEN AND WOMEN WHO START A SMALL BUSINESS, THE GREATEST CHALLENGE AND THE TOUGHEST COMPE CITIES IS NOT THE COMPETITION THAT COMES FROM THE GUY ACROSS TOWN OUR ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR EVEN HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD, THE TOUGHEST COMPETITION THEY'RE GOING TO FACE IS FROM THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT WHOSE POLICIES OF TAXATION, REGULATION AND LITIGATION MAKES IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT SMALL BUSINESS A SUCCESS. THAT OUGHT TO CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZING PRODUCTIVITY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT OUR CURRENT TAX SYSTEM DOES. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO TINKER WITH THE TAX CODE AND SAYS, IT NEEDS A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT. NO IT, IT NEEDS A MAJOR OVERHAUL. WE SAY IN THE SOUTH, IF YOU CAN'T CONDUCT TAPE IT AND WD-40 IT, IT CAN BE FIXED. WITHLE, OUR TAX CODE CAN'T BE FIXED WITH CONDUCT TAPE AND WD- 406789 I SAY, LET'S GET RID OF OUR TAX CODE AND GET RICHARD OUR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND REPLACE IT WITH A TAX SYSTEM THAT'S FAMILY FRIENDLY. IT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY OUR ECONOMY FUNCTIONS. BRINGING $10 TRILLION OF WORKING CAPITAL BACK HOME, RESTORING MANUFACTURING JOBS, GIVING THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNER A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY SUCCEED AND CREATE THE KIND OF JOBS AND WEALTH THAT MAKES IT WORK. NOW I'M GETTING A LOT OF HAMMERING THESE DAYS FROM FOLKS ON WALL STREET THAT I DON'T THINK UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM. THEY THINK MY GOAL IS TO MAKE RICH PEOPLE POOR. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT POOR PEOPLE GET RICH AND WOULDN'T BE PUSHED TIME EVERY TIME THEY TRIED BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT WHOSE TAX POLICIES DON'T GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THAT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE TO A GOOD ECONOMY. AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOME SIGNIFICANT AND MAJOR CHANGES. TODAY THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, ACCORDING TO ONE THAT DID A POLL, FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE AFRAID OF AN AUDIT OF THE I.R.S. THAN THEY ARE OF GETTING MUGGED. THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE. NOW THINK ABOUT THAT. I THOUGHT, THAT'S GOT TO BE CRAZY. THEN I REALIZED, IF YOU GET MUGGED, IT WOULD ONLY LAST A FEW SECONDS. AND THEY CAN ONLY GET WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOU. THE I.R.S. COMES AFTER YOU, THEY'LL TAKE EVERYTHING YOU GOT AND WEAR YOU OUT FOR MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS, TO GET IT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED A NEW TAX CODE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT SOME SERIOUS ISSUES WE FACE IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. THOSE ARE PROBLEMS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT AROUND YOUR KITCHEN TABLE. AND SOMETIMES YOU TALK ABOUT IT AFTER YOU'VE PUT YOUR KIDS TO BED. AND WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER LISTENING BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SCARE THEM ABOUT THE FUTURE, YOU SIT AND TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HANDLE COLLEGE COSTS FOR THOSE KIDS. AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU HAVEN'T STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT, IF THEY'RE MORE THAN A FEW DAYS OLD, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SAVE, YOU HAVEN'T SAVED ENOUGH. HAVING GOTTEN THREE KIDS AND A WIFE THROUGH COLLEGE, I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT NO PARENT CAN TRULY AFFORD, COLLEGE AND CAR INSURANCE. THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YOU EVERY TIME. I THINK MARK TWAIN SAID WHEN A KID TURNS 1 YOU OUGHT TO PUT THEM IN A BARREL, POKE THE KID'S FOOD THROUGH THE HOLE. WHEN THE KID TURNS 1, COVER THE HOLE. AND HE SAID THAT BEFORE THERE WERE DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR 16-YEAR-OLDS. WAS HE NOT PRO FETIC? THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS THAT HAVE ANXIETY ABOUT THEIR KIDS. NO MATTER HOW HARD THOSE PARENTS WORK, THEY SEEM TO BE WORKING HARDER THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR. BECAUSE GAS PRICES ARE 70 CENTS A GALLON MORE, IT COSTS MORE TO GET TO SCHOOL AND WORK, IT MEANS YOU WOULDN'T DO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE LAST YEAR. BECAUSE HEALTH INSURANCE IS UP TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION, NO MATTER HOW MUCH HARDER YOU'RE WORKING THIS YEAR, YOU'RE NOT GETTING AHEAD. IF YOU'RE BARELY STAYING EVEN, YOU'RE LUCKY AND ONE OF THE FEW. SOME PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT INCREASINGLY HARD TO STAY WHERE THEY WERE A YEAR AGO. AND THEN IF YOU ADD TO THAT THE COST OF EDUCATION, THERE ARE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE BEING HAD LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP AS MOM AND DAD SAYS, WHAT KIND OF FUTURE FOR MY KIDS? WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR IN 1996 -- I HAD BEEN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOR THREE YEARS, SOMEWHAT OF AN AUDIT AT THE STATE CAPITOL, AS SENATOR HUTCHINSON CAN TELL YOU. THERE WERE SO THRILLED TO SEE ME THEY NAILED MY DOOR SHUT FROM THE INSIDELE AND IT STAYED SHUT FOR 59 DAYS THAT I WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I KNOW PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT -- I SAID, LITERALLY NAILED THE DOOR SHUT FROM THE NIGHT I FINALLY GOT IN BUT I WAS NOT WELCOMED WITH OPEN ARMS. MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS WHEN MY PREDECESSOR WAS FORCED TO RESIGN BECAUSE OF FELONY CONVICTIONS AND AS A RESULT I WAS THRUST INTO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN JULY OF 1996. I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS MY JOB AS GOVERNOR TO EVERYDAY WAKE UP AND ASK, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TODAY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE 7-YEAR-OLD KID LIVING IN DURHAMA, ARKANSAS? IT'S A SMALL TOWN IN THE ARKANSAS DELTA AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED REGION IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA REGION. AND THERE ARE INTENSE POCKETS OF POVERTY IN THAT MISSISSIPPI DELTA AREA. I COULD PICK THE NUMBER OF TOWNS. I KNEW PEOPLE THERE. I HAD THE PICTURE IN MY MIND OF A 7-YEAR-OLD KID EATING BREAK FAST THERE EVERY DAY. IN -- BREAKFAST THERE EVERY DAY. I SAID, WHAT'S GOING TO HELP THE KID? WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL IS HE GOING TO GO TO? WHAT KIND OF ROAD WILL HE DRIVE ON? WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CAN HE ACCESS? WHAT KIND OF JOB CAN HE EXPECT TO FIND WHEN HE'S OUT OF SCHOOL? AND WILL HIS EDUCATION, GIVEN THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY GET THOSE JOBS? WILL HE BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE BEAUTY OF WHAT WE CALL THE NATURAL STATE? THAT'S OUR STATE'S MOTTO. AND I TRIED TO MAKE DECISIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THINK OF HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THAT 7-YEAR-OLD BOY IN ARKANSAS. WE TOOK ON CHANGING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND REFORMING IT. WE INCREASED TEACHER PAY AND WE ASKED MORE FROM THE TEACHERS AND WE GOT IT. AND THE RESULT WAS, NOT ONLY DID THEY GO FROM THE LOWEST PAID TEACHERS, ALMOST IN THE NATION, TO THE HIGHEST PAID IN THE REGION, BUT WE SAW OUR TEST SCORES IMPROVE IN EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY FROM THE TIME THAT WE RAISED STANDARDS AND HAD ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW KIND OF PARTNERSHIP WHERE PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WERE ALL INVOLVED IN TRYING TO MAKE IT ABOUT THE STUDENTS, NOT JUST ABOUT THE SCHOOLS. THE CORRECT FOUNDATION SAID WE DID MORE IN FIVE YEARS THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THE PREVIOUS 50 YEARS TO REFORM EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. WE HAD A ROAD SYSTEM THAT WAS THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO TRUCKER'S MAGAZINE THEY SAID IT WAS THE WORST. THOSE GUYS OUGHT TO KNOW. I WASN'T PROUD OF THAT. NEITHER WERE THE PEOPLE IN MY STATE. AND THEY KNEW IT CAUSED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF EXTRA DAMAGE TO THEIR CARS EACH YEAR AND I SAID, LET'S HAVE A ROAD SYSTEM THAT WILL BE SAFE FOR OUR KIDS AND SOMETHING WE CAN BE PROUD OF. AND WE REBUILT OUR ROAD SYSTEM AND BRIDGES AND FIVE YEARS LATER THE SAME MAGAZINE SAID WE HAD THE MORE IMPROVED ROAD SYSTEM. IF CAN I GET AN 80% RATE ON CAUCUS NIGHT I WOULD LIKE THAT. WE CHANGED HEALTH CARE BECAUSE A LOT OF KIDS IN OUR STATE DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH TO AFFORD ACCESS TO A DOCTOR. SO THEY WOULD GET SICK AND GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, WHICH WAS REALLY EXPENSIVE. WE CREATED THE OUR KIDS FIRST PROGRAM. PARENTS FADE. IT WASN'T WELFARE. IT WAS A PARTNERSHIP AND THE STATE MADE IT POSSIBLE SO THAT ANY PARENT, WORKING-CLASS PARENT COULD GO TO THE DOCTOR AND HAVE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND BE TAKEN CARE OF WITH MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE. THAT LITTLE KID IN DURINGMONT, IF HE HAS A TOOTHACHE AND STOMACH ACHE, IF HE'S NOT HEALTHY HE'S NOT LEARNING. YOU CAN'T SEPARATE DECENT HEALTH CARE AND DECENT EDUCATION. IT WASN'T A HANDOUT. WE REFORMED WELFARE. AND WE MOVED 50% OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON WELFARE OUT OF WELFARE AND INTO JOBS. WE HAD THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF JOBS AND THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA JOBS COME TO THAT STATE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. I SAW A $200 MILLION DEFICIT TO BECOME A $850 MILLION PLUS. -- SURPLUS. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO THE MAILBOX AND SAY, HERE ARE ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT MIKE HUCKABEE DID. EVERY TIME YOU TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION YOU ARE GOING TO SEE ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT MY OPPONENTS SAY I DID. YOU HAVE A WASHINGTON GROUP TELLING YOU THAT I'M A BUM. MITT ROMNEY'S EVERY DAY, FLOODING YOUR TELEVISION SETS TELLING YOU I'M A BUM. I COULD HAVE SAVED THOSE GUYS A LOT OF MONEY. MY WIFE COULD HAVE COME TO IOWA. SHE'S HERE IN IOWA. SHE WOULD TELL YOU FOR FREERKS I'M A BUM. [LAUGHTER] >> BUT I TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE SHE'S TELLING PEOPLE TODAY IN IOWA, SHE'S TELLING THEM, THAT I SERVE MY PEOPLE. AND THAT I NEVER FORGOT WHY I WAS GOVERNOR. AND IT WASN'T ABOUT ADVANCING MY CAREER. IT WAS ABOUT ADVANCING THE FUTURE AND THE LIFE OF THAT 7-YEAR-OLD KID IN DURMONT. I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INCREDIBLY DESPERATE AND FRANKLY DISHONEST THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT ME. YESTERDAY IT GOT EVEN WORSE. SOME VERY DISHONEST AND DESPERATE THINGS SAID ABOUT ONE OF MY RIVALS IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR PRESIDENT. AS MITT ROMNEY NOT ONLY IS NOW ATTACKING ME, BUT HE'S ATTACKING JOHN MCCAIN. JOHN MCCAIN AND I ARE RUNNING FOR THE SAME JOB. ONE OF US WILL WIN, ONE OF US WON'T. BUT I WILL TELL YOU I WON'T ATTACK HIM. HE'S A GREAT AND HONEST AND HONORABLE AMERICAN. AS I'M GETTING ATTACKED, I JUST FINALLY DECIDED YESTERDAY, HE'S NOW ATTACKED JOHN MCCAIN, RUDY GIULIANI, HE'S ATTACKED EVERYBODY. HE'S NOT TELLING PEOPLE WHY HE OUGHT TO BE PRESIDENT. HE'S ONLY TELLING PEOPLE WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE PRESIDENT. AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. AND TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE TRUTH REALLY IS. BECAUSE YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THAT TRUTH IS. AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE ONE DAY, ONE OF US IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AND YOU ARE GOING TO TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION SOME NIGHT AND THE ANNOUNCER WILL SAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND I HOPE YOUR HEAD WILL TURN TO THE TELEVISION AND WILL BE WATCHING ONE OF US SPEAK AND I HOPE IT IS ME. I BELIEVE IT WILL BE. AND THIS WEEK IT WILL BE. AND WHEN THAT CAMERA COMES ON, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE AND TELLING YOU THE TRUTH, WHETHER IT'S ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY OR ABOUT THE WAR OR WHETHER IT'S ABOUT THE TAX SYSTEM, OR WHETHER IT'S ABOUT THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND WHY WE NEED TO PROTECT IT AND VALUE IT. AND IT NEEDS TO BE SPOKEN OF CONVICTION. IT NEEDS TO BE SPOKEN WITH CLARITY BECAUSE THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT JOB OF THE PRESIDENT OTHER THAN BEING THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF OUR MILITARY FORCES IS TO BE THE COMMUNICATOR IN CHIEF OF OUR HEART AND OUR SOUL AND TO REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. [APPLAUSE] AND IF A PERSON BECOMES PRESIDENT BY BEING DISHONEST, NOW JUST REMEMBER, THAT IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT HE WILL LIKELY NOT START BEING HONEST IN THE JOB IF HE HAD BEEN DISHONEST TO GET THERE. IF YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT MIKE HUCKABEE HAD THIS HUGE BUDGET EXPANS, LET ME TELL YOU, ""NEW YORK TIMES"" TODAY HAD AN ARTICLE THAT SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND IN FACT POINTED OUT THAT THE BUDGET INCREASE IN MY STATE WAS ABOUT 3.9% EACH YEAR OVER THE 10-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH WAS COMPARABLE TO ANYBODY'S, INCLUDING MITT ROMNEY. THE FACT THAT WE HAD A MAJOR ACCOUNTING CHANGE WHERE WE CHANGED OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, WHICH IS A LOT OF INSIDE BASEBALL STUFF. BUT THE POINT BEING THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY EVEN LESS THAN THAT ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR THINGS THAT I RAISED TAXES. WHAT YOU WON'T HEAR THEM SAY IS THAT I CUT 94 TAXES INCLUDING THE MARRIAGE PENALTY. WE REDUCED PROPERTY TAXES, PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER PEOPLE TO KEEP THOSE HOMES AND WE CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAXES. WE PUT A NEW THRESHOLD WHEN PEOPLE PAY TAXES SO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE POOREST COULDN'T GET SUCKED INTO A TAX SYSTEM THAT THEY COULDN'T AFFORD. WE HELPED THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A GOOD TAX POLICY COULD DO. I UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT WAS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP. I DIDN'T GROW UP WITH A LAST NAME THAT OPENED A DOOR. IN FACT, MY LAST NAME ACTUALLY CLOSED A FEW. THE RENT SIGN WE HAD ON OR YARD SAID, -- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CARED. NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I EVER REMEMBER SOMEBODY ASKING MY DAD WOULD HE BE COMING OUT AND ENDORSING A CANDIDATE. HIS OPINION DIDN'T MATTER. HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER FOR THE CITY OF HOPE, ARKANSAS. AND ON HIS DAYS OFF A MECHANIC REBUILDING CAR GENERATORS IN A LITTLE SHOP HE HAD. MY DAD GOT DIRTY EVERY DAY DOING WHAT HE DID, LIFTING HEAVY THINGS. NEVER HAD A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. AND NOBODY UPSTREAM FROM ME AS A MALE HAS EVER, FAR AS WE CAN LOOK, EVEN GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. MY SON SAID, DON'T LOOK TOO FAR UP THAT FAMILY TREE. THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE BUT AS FAR UP AS I EVER LOOKED, NO MALE HAD EVER GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS THE FIRST. AND CERTAINLY THE FIRST TO GO ON TO COLLEGE. MY MOTHER GREW UP AS A LITTLE GIRL WITH DIRT FLOORS, OUTDOOR TOILETS. SHE UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING OF POVERTY AS MY PARENTS BECAME PART OF WHAT WE CALLED THE GREATEST GENERATION. WE CALL THEM THE GREATEST GENERATION BECAUSE THEY MADE THE GREATEST SACRIFICES FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THAT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE EVER BEEN DONE. IT WASN'T ABOUT THEM. IT WAS ABOUT THEIR KIDS. AND THEY MADE SURE THAT WE HAD A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY EVER COULD HAVE DREAMED. AND BECAUSE OF THEIR SACRIFICES TODAY WE ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF A MARVELOUS COUNTRY. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE DONE AS MUCH FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AS OUR PARENTS GENERATION DID FOR US. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE. AND THAT'S NOT ABOUT THE HORIZONTAL LEFT-RIGHT POLITICS OF THE DAY THAT POLARIZES PEOPLE. IT OUGHT TO BE THE KIND THE POLITICS THAT BRINGS US BACK TOGETHER. AND REGARDLESS WHERE YOU ARE ON THE SCALE YOU NEED TO REALIZE THAT AMERICA IS TOO IMPORTANT TO LET THE DESPERATE AND DISHONEST POLITICS KEEPING YOU FROM HAVING REAL LEADERSHIP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, REAL LEADERSHIP THAT WILL TAKE THIS COUNTRY TO THE PLACE WHERE THAT 7-YEAR-OLD KID IN DURMONT, ARKANSAS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT ABOUT THOSE OF US THAT ARE ADULTS. ABOUT THE KIDS OUT THERE THAT WE OWE THE BEST TO, NOT THE WORST. AND I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT THAT CARES ABOUT THAT KID IN DURMONT AND CARES ABOUT THE KID IN INDIANOLA. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SUEDE BY SOME COMPLETELY, ABSOLUTELY, OFFTHE CHART THINGS THAT ARE BEING SAID ON TELEVISION ADS THAT AREN'T TRUE. LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT I COMMUTED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN ARKANSAS. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, I HAD 8,700 REQUESTS ON MY DESK. 97% OF THEM I TURNED THEM DOWN. BUT I DID GRANT A FEW. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER FOR ME TO SAY NO TO ALL OF THEM. MITT ROMNEY SAID NO TO EVERY ONE OF THEM BUT HE ONLY HAD 100 REQUESTS COMPARED TO 8,700 ON MINE. BUT THE OTHER THING I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT SOMETIMES THOSE REQUESTS, IS NOT AS HE PORTRAYS THEM TO BE. LET ME GIVE YOU A CASE AND SEE WHAT YOU WOULD DO. ONE OF THEM WAS, YOUNG MAN WHO WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE, HE WAS WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD AND HE DID. HE WENT TO IRAQ AND SERVED IN COMBAT. FOUGHT IN THE SUNNI TRIANGLE, RECEIVED THE BRONZE STAR FOR HIS COMBAT ACTION. HE CAME BACK FROM WAR HAVING EDUCATED HIMSELF IN COLLEGE, SIGNED UP AS A VOLUNTEER IN THE NATIONAL GUARD, FROM COMBAT HE CAME AND HE WANTED TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. WHEN HE HAD BEEN 13 YEARS OLD HE HAD SHOT A FRIEND IN THE ARM WITH A B.B. GUN. NOW IT DIDN'T BREAK THE SKIN. BUT IT WAS ON HIS RECORD. AS A RESULT OF THAT HE COULDN'T GET INTO THE ACADEMY TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER. SO HE APPLIED FOR A PARDON SO HE COULD GET THAT OFF HIS RECORD AND FULFILL HIS DREAM TO BE A POLICEMAN. TWICE THE STATE'S PAROLE BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT HE GET A PARDON. NOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THAT CASE WERE ON YOUR DESK GIVEN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES? HE'S FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. HE STOOD IN FRONT OF A BULLET FOR YOU AND ME. NOW HE WANTS TO COME BACK AND BE A FRONTLINE SOLDIER FOR THE WAR ON CRIME. HOW MANY WOULD NOT GIVE HIM THE PARDON? WOULD ANY OF YOU SAY, NO? OK. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS. YOU HAVE JUST AGREED TO WHAT I WOULD HAVE AGREED TO. BY THE WAY, I -- THAT WAS A CASE MITT ROMNEY HAD. MITT ROMNEY SAID NO TO THAT CASE TWICE. AND THAT YOUNG MAN DIDN'T GET TO BE A POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY MADE THE DECISION THAT HIS POLITICAL FUTURE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANTHONY'S FUTURE TO BE A POLICE OFFICER DESPITE WHAT HE HAD DONE TO HIS COUNTRY. ANOTHER CASE, 26-YEAR-OLD WANTS TO GO TO CULINARY SCHOOL TO BECOME A CHEF. HE CAN'T GET IN BECAUSE THE FACT THAT AT 18 YEARS OLD A FRIEND OF HIS CAME BY AND PICKED HIM UP. TURNED OUT THE CAR WAS STOLEN WHEN THE POLICE PULLED HIM OVER. THE DRIVER GOT ARRESTED FOR A STOLEN CAR. HE GOT ARRESTED FOR BEING AN ACCESSORY. HE WAS WRONG. NEVER SERVED A DAY IN JAIL BUT HE DID HAD TO PAY A FINE. BUT IT'S ON HIS RECORD. NOW HE CAN'T GET INTO SCHOOL. HE WANTS A PARDON SO HE CAN GO TO SCHOOL, FULFILL HIS DREAM TO BE A CHEF. BOARD RECOMMENDS PARDON. WHAT DO YOU DO? HOW MANY SAY GIVE HIM THE PARDON? SEE YOUR HANDS. OK. HOW MANY SAY, DON'T GIVE HIM THE PARDON, JUST LET HIM STAY UNEMPLOYED? NO HANDS. I DON'T SEE A ONE. WELL, THAT CASE WAS ON MY DESK AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THAT MITT ROMNEY ACCUSES ME OF BEING LIGHT ON AND SAYING I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE. THE 16 PEOPLE THAT I CARRIED OUT AN EXECUTION IN ARKANSAS WOULD HARDY SAY I WAS SOFT ON CRIME. THAT'S NO OTHER PERSON THAT ANYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT EVER HAD TO DO. IF HE WOULD DO A LITTLE FACT CHECKING IN 1999 WE DOUBLED THE SENTENCES FOR METH AND METH LABS WENT DOWN 48% DURING MY YEAR AS TENURE. METH PENALTIES IN MY STATE WERE FOUR TIMES HARSHER THAN THEY WERE IN MITT ROMNEY'S MASSACHUSETTS. SO WHEN HE TELLS YOU I WAS SOFT ON CRIME AND SOFT ON METHAMPHETAMINE, A LITTLE FACT CHECKING WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE CLEARER FOR YOU AND FOR ME. WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST ELECTING SOMEBODY WHO CAN RUN SOME CLEVER ADS. YOU'RE ELECTING SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO SHOOT STRAIGHT WITH YOU IF THEY'RE ELECTED. IF THEY LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND SAY YOUR KIDS NEED TO GO AND FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE TELLING YOU AN HONEST REASON WHY AND SOMETHING YOU CAN TRUST AND BELIEVE IN. IF A PRESIDENT SITS DOWN AND TELLS YOU THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO CHANGE ITS TAX CODE YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT'S TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. IF A PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED TO BECOME INDEPENDENT OF ENERGY SOURCES THAT WE DON'T HAVE AND HAVE OUR OWN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, AND HERE'S HOW WE CAN GET THERE, YOU NEED TO BELIEVE THAT HE AT LEAST BELIEVES THAT IT'S GOING TO GET DONE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO GET DONE. IF THAT PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE FROM THE TIME OF CONCEPTION BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO OUR CIVILIZATION THAN THE RESPECT OF HUMAN LIFE BECAUSE OF THE INTRINSIC WORTH AND VALUE OF EVERY HUMAN LIFE, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT PRESIDENT ACTUALLY BELIEVES IT AND WHEN HE GETS IN OFFICE THAT HE'LL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AS I DID IN THE GOVERNOR IN ARKANSAS SIGNING PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION TIME AND TIME AGAIN. YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR PRESIDENT REALLY MEANS IT. YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT YOUR PRESIDENT REALLY BELIEVES THAT TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ONLY HOW WE BRING OUR KIDS IN THIS WORLD BUT THAT'S HOW WE TRAIN OUR FAMILY. AND GOVERNMENT SHUNNED UNDERMINE OUR BASIC FAMILY PRINCIPLES. IT OUGHT TO UNDERGIRD THOSE FAMILY PRINCIPLESES. IT OUGHT TO HELP YOU AS A MOM AND DAD TO MAKE CHANGES ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND FUTURE. IN A FEW DAYS YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DECISION. THE REPERCUSSIONS OF YOUR DECISION LITERALLY WILL BE FELT AROUND THE WORLD. I'M NOT BEING MELODRAMATIC ABOUT THAT. THE WORLD'S EYES WILL BE ON IOWA ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 3. AND HERE'S WHY. WHEN PEOPLE LOOKING IN AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IOWA, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE THIS PRESIDENTIAL PROCESS IS REALLY GOING. NOW MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS PEOPLE THAT'S NOT BEING OUTSPENT OF 20 -1 CAN BE PRESIDENT. AND MITT ROMNEY IS OUTSPENDING ME 20-1 IN THIS STATE. IT WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF THIS COUNTRY IF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA SAID WE WILL NOT BE BOUGHT, WE WILL NOT EVEN BE RENTED, WE WILL MAKE UP OUR OWN DECISIONS AND WE WILL VOTE FOR SOMEBODY FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT HE BELIEVES LIKE WE BELIEVE AND LIKE THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO GO. AND THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU TO GO OUT ON CAUCUS NIGHT AND NOT ONLY VOTE FOR ME BUT DON'T GO ALONE. AND WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE ON CAUCUS NIGHT, TAKE FOLKS WITH YOU, FRIENDS, RELATIVES, ASSOCIATES FROM WORK, NEIGHBORS, WHOEVER IT IS, TAKE THEM WITH YOU. IF YOU HAVE NEIGHBORS THAT SAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, THEN YOU DON'T LET THEM OUT OF THEIR HOUSE, OK? SHOVEL SNOW IN THEIR DRIVEWAYS. TELL THEM THE ORANGE BOWL IS REALLY, REALLY WORTH WATCHING THAT NIGHT. I DON'T CARE. NOW IF YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE WILLING TO VOTE FOR ME, DON'T LET THEM STAY HOME. IN FACT, CALL SOME FOLKS UP AND SAY, HEY, THE WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING. WE WANT TO TAKE YOU GUYS OUT TO DINNER. HONK THE HORN. WHEN THEY POP IN THE BACKSEAT, TOSS THEM A BALONEY SANDWICH SAY, EAT QUICK. CAUCUS STARTS IN 0 MINUTES. GET OUT AND GET THE VOTES COUNTED. WE MAY NOT V THE MONEY BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE HEART OF PEOPLE IN IOWA WHO BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OUGHT NOT TO GET THERE BECAUSE OF HAD THE MOST MONEY BUT BECAUSE HE HAD THE KIND OF IDEAS THAT WOULD AFFECT THE LIFE OF THE 7-YEAR-OLD KID HAVING BREAKFAST IN DURMONT, ARKANSAS, AS WELL AS THE ONE HAVING BREAKFAST IN INDIANOLA, IOWA. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ON CAUCUS NIGHT. NEED YOU OUT THERE. AND I HOPE YOU'LL GIVE US YOUR VOTE, YOUR SUPPORT. CALL, EMAIL, WRITE, AND GO SEE EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. LET'S HAVE AN INCREDIBLE VICTORY THAT PUTS THE WORLD ON ITS EAR COME JANUARY 3. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> I KNOW ABOUT ME, I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM BECOME OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, WE HAVE COMMITMENT CARDS, AS YOU LEAVE HERE OUT OF THIS RESTAURANT. IF THERE'S A SUPPORTER RIGHT THERE. IF YOU WOULD SIGN UP AND LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE. AND GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE SAID, TAKE FRIENDS, TAKE NEIGHBORS, YOU CAN HAVE A VOICE. AS THE WORLD SETS THE SIGHTS ON IDEA, LET THEM KNOW THAT A MESSAGE IS BEING SENT. VOTE MIKE HUCKABEE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> COME HERE, THERE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT'S HER NAME? >> LILY, LOOK AT MOMMY. >> WHOA. THANK GOODNESS SHE COULDN'T CRAWL ON ME, HUH? THANK YOU. THANKS FOR COMING OUT TODAY. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. >> GOD BLESS YOU. >> CAN I GET A PICTURE OF YOU WITH MY SON? >> SURE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> TYLER. >> NICE TO SEE YOU. DID YOU GET IT? THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. YOU WANT ME TO SIGN THAT FOR YOU? >> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO? >> I'D BE HAPPY TO. >> WHERE ARE YOU WITH THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND HIND? >> IT'S GOOD. IT TREATS EVERY CHILD WITH INDIVIDUAL RESPECT BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED IN IT. THE TEST SCORES CAN BE SKEWED. IF YOU HAVE DAYS PROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF KIDS ON E.S.L. ARE YOU A TEACHER? >> MY WIFE IS. >> MY SISTER IS AND HAS BEEN FOR 3 YEARS. THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT THE CONCEPT IS FLAWED. THE CONCEPT IS EVERY STUDENT IS TREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL. THAT'S GREAT. >> RIGHT. >> IT'S A MATTER OF TWEAKING THOSE POINTS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC, MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE TESTING THAT YOU COVER THE BROAD SPECTRUM. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS A LOT OF SCHOOLS HAVE CUT OUT THE ARTS AND MUSIC. THAT'S CRITICAL TO A STUDENT'S SUCCESS. >> YOU NEED TO REVISIT IT AND REVISE IT. >> AND MAKE IT BETTER. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET RID OF IT. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF CARING ABOUT EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD. >> APPRECIATE IT. >> WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE TEACH? >> FIRST GRADE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD LUCK. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> THREE PEOPLE BACK THERE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING SMOTHERED OUT THERE. >> SHE LOVES ATTENTION. DON'T BELIEVE HER. >> SHE HAS A POLITICAL FUTURE, RIGHT? >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> STEVEN. >> YOU HAVE A GOOD SMILE. WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT TODAY? >> THAT I GOT TO SEE YOU. >> LISTEN AT YOU. THANK YOU. DID YOUR MOM OR DAD TELL YOU TO SAY THAT OR DID YOU COME WITH THAT BY YOURSELF? >> MY DAD. >> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU REALLY GOT HIM TRAINED WELL. >> MIKE HUCKABEE. APPRECIATE YOU COMING TODAY. >> BE THERE TO VOTE FOR YOU. >> THANK YOU. AND YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAD. DON'T LET HIM SIT HOME ON THE THIRD. >> MIKE HUCKABEE. >> JILL. >> THANKS FOR COMING OUT TODAY. >> WHAT DOES THAT SAY? U.S. MARINE CORPS. >> MY BROTHER JUST GRADUATED LAST OCTOBER. >> WHERE IS HE NOW? >> UP IN ALASKA. >> HE PROBABLY FEELS AT HOME IN THAT COLD WEATHER, HUH? >> YEAH. >> HI THERE, GUYS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HELLO. SARAH. NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING TODAY. >> TRISHA. >> HI. >> NICE TO MEET YOU. >> SURE. >> SHE WENT TO THE HIGH SCHOOL FOR YOU FOR CAUCUS. >> YOU WON, BY THE WAY. REPUBLICANS. 72 VOTES. NEXT WAS JOHN MCCAIN FOR 22. SO THAT TELLS YOU HOW BIG A DIFFERENCE. >> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANY. OK, TRISH. ARE YOU ABLE TO COME WITH ME THE NEXT FEW DAYS? >> SURE. >> WE MIGHT HAVE TO THROW YOU ON THE BUS? >> OK. >> SO YOU MUST HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH. >> YEAH. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> MIKE HUCKABEE. >> CRAIG. TRISHA'S DAD. >> I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF HER AS I AM. >> I AM. >> THIS WILL BE HER FIRST CAUCUS. SHE'S 18. >> ARE YOU, REALLY? I WANT TO BE YOUR FIRST VOTE. THAT WOULD BE A REAL HONOR FOR ME, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT YOU GOT ME ELECTED IN YOUR SCHOOL. >> YEAH. >> GOOD WORK. THANK YOU, TRISH. >> I'LL TRY TO GET THERE SOMEHOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN. HOW ARE YOU, GUYS? >> THANK YOU FOR CARING ABOUT THE 7-YEAR-OLD BOYS. I'M A SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT IN SOUTHWEST, IOWA. AND I BELIEVE IN 7-YEAR-OLD BOYS. THOSE LITTLE BOYS ARE EATING BREAKFAST AT SCHOOL BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HELPS US AT THAT. KEEP THAT FOOD COMING. >> I TELL YOU SOMETHING, SOMETHING THAT I'M SO PROUD OF. EVERY WEEKEND WE LOAD UP 450 BACKPACKS WITH FOOD AND THEY TAKE THOSE HOMES BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE FOOD AT HOME. >> OUR CHURCH DOES THAT TOO. >> THERE'S HUNGER AND THOSE KIDS GO WITH A BACKPACK FULL OF FOOD. WE SEND IT BACK OUT TO THEM ON FRIDAY. WE DO IT EVERY WEEK. >> THAT'S AWESOME. >> IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE OF. YOU SEE IT EVERY DAY. THERE ARE KIDS WHO COME TO SCHOOL AND THEY DON'T COME WITH MUCH MORE THAN THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK. >> AND IF WE DON'T FEED THEM THEY DON'T EET. >> MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I SAW IT NOT ONLY AS A PASTOR BUT I SAW IT AS A GOVERNOR WHERE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING MORE THAN A LOT OF FOLKS GIVE THEM CREDIT. HOW LONG ARE YOU BEEN IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM? >> I'VE JUST BEEN IN ESSEX THIS YEAR BUT TEACHING SINCE 1974. >> GOD BLESS YOU. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. WE'RE PRAYING FOR YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> I HAVE A FRIEND IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS THAT'S BEEN TELLING ME. >> DID THEY SAY NICE THINGS? >> SHE DID. SHE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF WORLD -- NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER LAST YEAR. >> GREAT. I PARTICIPATED IN THERE MOST YEARS. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING, YOUNG MAN? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> JOSIAH. >> HI, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> JESSICA. >> NICE TO SEE YOU. >> KIM. >> JEFF. >> NICE TO SEE YOU. THE RED HEADS ARE MINE, CAN YOU TELL? >> YOU KNOW, I KIND OF FIGURED IT OUT. AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. >> JOSHUA, NICE TO MEET YOU. >> MY FOLKS ARE MISSIONARIES IN SOUTH AMERICA. >> WHERE ARE THEY? >> PERU. AND ALL MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE DOWN THERE TOO. I'M THE ONLY ONE BACK HERE. I'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE IT'S NOT HOW MANY POLITICSES WE ELECT OR DIFFERENT POLITICIANS, I AGREE WITH YOU, BUT IT'S WHAT AMERICA WANTS TO GO. AMERICA HAS RUN AWAY FROM GOD AND WE NEED A GUY LIKE YOU TO GET AMERICA BACK TO GOD BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEM. WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU. >> APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOD BLESS YOU. >> WE'RE PRAYING FOR YOU TOO. >> I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU. >> YOU HAVE FAITH IN THE WORLD. >> I APPRECIATE THAT. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU'LL SIGN THIS. >> THANKS FOR PUTTING UP FOR THIS RATHER SMOTHERING CONDITION HERE. >> DON'T MIND AT ALL. >> HOPE YOU WILL BE OUT ON THE CAURKS. >> I WILL. >> THANKS. HI THERE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> JESSICA. >> JEREMY. >> NICE TO MEET YOU. >> DORIS. I WOULD LIKE TO URGE YOU TO BE -- [INAUDIBLE] >> SURE. I'M NOT FOR AMNESTY. ASK SENATOR HUTCHINSON. I SIGNED A BILL THAT PROHIBITED PEOPLE WHO ARE ILLEGAL TO GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE. WHAT MITT ROMNEY HAS SAID IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. >> OK. >> WE READ YOUR BOOK. >> YEAH. >> WELL, I APPRECIATE IT. >> YOU MR. NATIONS? >> YEAH. I WAS ON CNN THE OTHER DAY. THEY PUT ON THE ONE THING THAT -- I SAID SOMETHING ABOUT -- FIRST OF ALL, THE FAIR TAX POSITION I LIKE. THE FACT THAT YOU WERE RUNNING AS A -- [INAUDIBLE] AND THAT YOU WERE COMING FROM BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES. >> YES, SIR. >> THAT'S THE PART THEY PUT ON. BUT THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU OUT AS SOME RELIGIOUS PERSON. >> AND I'M NOT ASHAMED OF THAT BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO ME THAN THAT. >> WE'RE NOT EITHER. >> APPRECIATE YOUR STANCE. >> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. WHAT DOES THAT SAY? >> WELL, THAT'S JUST A CAP. >> KEEP YOU WARM. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> YOU NEED THAT TODAY. >> I GOT TO START HEADING THAT BAY. >> I APPRECIATE YOUR -- THAT WAY. >> I APPRECIATE YOUR POSITIVE ADS. >> I APPRECIATE THAT. >> GOD BLESS YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR RUNNING. >> THANK YOU. >> APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TOO. >> HI THERE.

AND I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU AND I HOPE THAT YOU WIN. >> THANK YOU. KEEP THAT UP. I'M SORRY YOU MISSED SOME SEATS. SOME THAT TOLD YOU WOULD TELL YOU YOU WERE THE LUCKY ONE. >> MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS THE BLOND GIRL. >> THE ONE WITH RED ON? SHE'S GOT SOME PENALTY. >> YES, SHE DOES. >> SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS. SMILED BIG. YOU ALWAYS WORRY WHEN THE BABIES YOU HOLD START CRYING. THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. I WAS VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> THANKS FOR COMING TODAY. I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS SHOWING UP. HOW ARE YOU? HI. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GET CLOSTER PHOBIA OVER THERE? >> YEAH. >> THANKS FOR DOING THE CONFERENCE CALLS. IT'S POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT. A LOT OF CANDIDATES AREN'T DOING IT. IT REALLY HELPS US WRITE THE STORIES. THANK YOU FOR THE CONFERENCE CALLS. >> WE TRY TO KEEP DOING IT AS OFTEN AS WE CAN. >> IT'S JUST MORE GENUINE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >> THANKS. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE THEM LONGER. YESTERDAY WE WERE LITTLE -- RESTRICTED. WE WILL DO SOMETHING HERE. >> ARE WE GOING TO DO IT HERE? >> YEAH. 1:30. >> OK. I GOT TO DO THE C-SPAN THING. >> WE SAW YOUR COLUMN. >> HE MIGHT DO IT RIGHT. >> THREE, TWO, ONE. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> YES? >> I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> UH-HUH. >> ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE OUT THESE PEOPLE AND -- THAT'S OVER IN IRAQ AND -- BECAUSE, I MEAN, FOR ONE THING, I CAN TELL YOU THIS RIGHT NOW, WE -- THE SOLDIERS IN IRAQ SHOULD NOT BE HERE. THEY SHOULD BE BACK WITH THEIR FAMILY AND EVERYTHING AND ALL -- I CAN TELL YOU THIS, I'VE HEARD THIS AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH BECAUSE I TOOK GOVERNMENT IN MY FIRST SEMESTER IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT IS THAT EVERYBODY IS WANTING TO -- ALL GEORGE W. BUSH IS WANTING TO DO IS TAKE THE -- HAVE THE MONEY. FOR THE OIL THAT'S OVER THERE. THAT'S ALL HE'S WANTING. AND WE -- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT DOES THAT. >> I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IT FOR THE OIL. I THINK HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE HE REALLY WANTS TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR AMERICA. I KNOW PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE WITH HIM AND BE GREAT AMERICANS. I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S DOING IT FOR A DISHONORABLE REASON. I KNOW HIM. I'VE BEEN TO IRAQ AND I'VE VISITED OUR TROOPS THERE. AND I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY'RE GETTING DONE AND HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT A BETTER PLACE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK THERE AND FIGHT IT AGAIN. >> I MEAN, BECAUSE -- OSAMA BIN LADEN -- SADDAM -- SADDAM HUSSEIN WASN'T PART OF IT, YOU KNOW? THE ONLY PERSON PART OF IT WAS THE 9/11 ATTACKERS. >> WELL, I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTED, AND EVEN THE DEMOCRATS AGREED WITH HIM WHEN HE TOOK OUR TROOPS THERE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO YOU. I RESPECT YOUR VIEW. IT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA A GREAT PLACE. YOU CAN HAVE TOTAL DISAGREEMENT AND CAN'T GET ARRESTED FOR DISAGREEING WITH A POLITICS. >> HAVE A GREAT DAY. >> I HOPE SO. THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN. >> YOU BET. >> I'M ABOUT TO GET THE HANG OF IT. I TELL YOU THE BEST PART, THAT DOG WE HAD WAS UNBELIEVABLE. HE MADE THE WHOLE THING WORTH DOING. >> MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> WATCH YOUR STEP. >> WHAT KIND OF DOG HAVE YOU GOT NOW? >> GERMAN SHORT HAIR. >> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MEET YOU GUYS UP HERE AT 1:30. >> GREAT FOR YOU. TERRIBLE FOR ME. I'LL PROBABLY DREAD THIS WHOLE THING. I'M SURE I WILL. >> C-SPAN. >> GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. THERE'S TIGHT QUARTERS OUT HERE. MAYBE WE'LL THIN IT OUT IN A MINUTE. HOW YOU GUYS DOING? >> GOOD. >> APPRECIATE Y'ALL COMING OUT TODAY. >> YOU BET. >> HI. GOOD FOR YOU.",2015-11-07 17:08:26,2003-09-09,Jacksonville,Florida
http://www.c-span.org/video/?203263-1/huckabee-campaign-event,Huckabee Campaign Event,Mike Huckabee,"HELLO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT HERE TODAY. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU. I LIKE IT DOWN HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, YOU PEOPLE HAVE A SEAT. WELL, IT IS TIME TO SAY THANKS AND WE HAVE TO GO. WHAT A WONDERFUL WELCOME. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS THIS MORNING. IT IS AN HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE. I ALWAYS AM AMAZED THAT A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE SOMEBODY THINGS TO DO WITH THE CAUCUSES THIS WEEK. YOU HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH POLITICAL STUFF. AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING, YOU PEOPLE COME OUT HERE TO THE FAIRGROUNDS. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK GOD THAT THERE IS HE IN THIS BUILDING. OTHERWISE, WE WOULD HAVE THE SHORTEST MEETING WE HAVE EVER HAD IN THE HISTORY OF IOWA POLITICS. YOU GUYS ARE ACCLIMATED TO THIS. EVERYTIME I GET OUTSIDE, I REMINDED THAT MY SOUTHERN BLOOD IS NOT QUITE READY FOR TEMPERATURES THIS COLD. THE ONLY THING THAT HAS HELPED IT HAS BEEN THE WARMTH OF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE SUMMIT TIMES. I REMEMBER COMING TO EVENTS ALL OVER THE STATE IN THE SUMMER AS WE WERE LEADING UP TO THE STRAW POLL. I WOULD BE FLATTERED IF WE HAD 15 OR 20 PEOPLE COMING. WE HAD PLENTY OF ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO SIT AT THE TABLES. WE WERE ALL SPREAD OUT A LITTLE BIT. A COUPLE OF PIZZAS WOULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY WHO NEEDED TO EAT. I WOULD BE FLATTERED IF SOMEBODY HAD A CELL PHONE CAMERA AND WANTED TO TAKE A PICTURE. IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THESE DAYS. IT IS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU. THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND BELIEVE OUR PARTY NEEDS SOMETHING. IT IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT WANTING TO BEAT UP THE OTHER GUYS. IT IS ABOUT WANTING TO LIFT UP THE NEXT GENERATION OF YOUNG AMERICANS. WE NEED TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF. I HAVE TO BE -- I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE -- WE WERE IN FLORIDA OR TEXAS, WE'RE SEEING THAT KIND OF INCREDIBLE SPIRIT. LAST NIGHT, 3000 PEOPLE PACKED INTO A ROOM. THERE IS NO WAY THAT MANY PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE. WE HAD CHUCK NORRIS AND HIS WIFE WITH US. I GOT TO ACT LIKE THEY WERE THERE FOR ME. THERE WAS SUCH AN EXCITEMENT. I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW. I DO NOT KNOW. I KNOW HAVE BEEN OUTSPENT 20 TO ONE. I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING A LOT OF TELEVISION ADVERTISEMENTS. THE REPORT OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN TELEVISION ADS TO TARGET ME. I KNOW EVERY DAY, YOU GO TO THE MAILBOX AND YOU GET STUFF IN THE MAIL. MY WIFE COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT FOR FREE. SHE IS HERE TODAY. I'M NOT GOING TO LET HER TELL YOU THAT FOR FREE. I STILL NEED YOUR VOTE TOMORROW. DESPITE THAT, PEOPLE IN IOWA SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE KNOW A PERSON WOULD BE ELECTED IN A STATE LIKE ARKANSAS FOUR TIMES IF HE WAS ANYTHING LIKE WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED BY THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. ARE WE GOING TO TRY TO FIRE BACK AND DO THE SAME THING TO OTHERS AS THEY HAVE DONE TO US OR ARE WE GOING TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS WE WISH THEY HAD DONE TO US. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SNEER AND A LAUGH AT IT. THE PEOPLE IN IOWA ARE GOING TO UNDERSTAND. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION NOT ONLY OF OUR NATION AND PARTY, BUT THE DIRECTION OF THE PATH WE GET THERE. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WE WILL BE PROUD OF AND NOT ASHAMED OF THE WAY WE GET THERE OR ASHAMED OF GETTING THERE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO PROUD OF THE STATE AS I HAVE BEEN OF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. PEOPLE TAKE THEIR PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS VERY SERIOUSLY. PEOPLE WANT TO MEET YOU SIX OR SEVEN TIMES BEFORE THEY CONSIDER VOTING FOR YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE. YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THIS STUFF. WHAT YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS SOME CONSISTENCY WHO HAS VIEWS ABOUT BEING FOR THE SANCTITY OF LIFE OR NOT SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT OF A FOCUS GROUP AND SAID THAT YOU HAVE TO BE PRO-LIFER IN THIS ELECTION. YOU CAN LOOK IN MY RECORD AND FIND OUT AS FAR AS BACK AS YOU CAN HEAR ME OR SAYING -- YOU CAN HEAR ME SAYING ANYTHING, I BELIEVE THAT THE SANCTITY OF LIFE IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO TREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME CONSISTENCY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUPPORT OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FIND THAT I ONCE SUPPORTED A GUN CONTROL MEASURE AND THEN CHANGED MY MIND. I DO IT BECAUSE IT IS A CONVICTION. I BELIEVE THAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. IT IS NOT ABOUT HUNTING, IT IS ABOUT OUR FREEDOM. IT IS ABOUT PROTECTING OUR FAMILIES. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SOMEONE OF PANDERS TO US AND SAYS THAT IS ALL ABOUT A POSITION NOW, I WANT TO KNOW THEIR CONVICTION IS OF WHAT IS DRIVING THEM, NOT POLITICS. WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT REALLY MATTER. I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR TIM. AND WE ARE NOT PAYING HIM ANYTHING. HE IS HERE BECAUSE HE IS THE FIRST REPUBLICAN SENATOR ELECTED IN MY STATE. HE KNOWS HOW TOUGH IT WAS TO GET ELECTED IN MY STATE. HE COMES HERE BECAUSE HE AND I AS COLLEAGUES AND FELLOW SOLDIERS AND FELLOW PILGRIMS IN A TOUGH POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT SAW HOW CHALLENGING IT WAS TO RUN AGAINST THE CLINTON POLITICAL MACHINE. WE UNDERSTAND IT. IF HILLARY AND OF BEING THE NOMINEE, I WILL BE THE ONLY PERSON RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO HAS ACTUALLY FACED IT IN NEVER ACTUALLY BEATEN IT, NOT ONCE BUT FOUR TIMES. I WANT TO DO IT ONE MORE TIME. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN HOW WE MIGHT APPROACH THINGS. I THINK TAXES OUGHT TO BE LOWERED. THAT IS WHY I LORD 94 DIFFERENT TAXES. AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE IN THE ONE UNDER 60 YEARS TO A BROADBASED TAX CUT. WE REBUILD OUR ROAD SYSTEM. OURS WAS IN A MESS. OUR PEOPLE WANTED IT. THEY VOTED 80% TO FIX THAT ROAD SYSTEM BECAUSE WE KNOW IF YOU DO NOT HAVE GOOD ROADS AND YOU CANNOT GET YOUR PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET AND THE MARKET DOES NOT WORK, YOU LOSE JOBS. WE CREATED 100,000 JOBS IN PART BECAUSE WE BUILD ROADS. WHAT I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT? I WOULD NOT APOLOGIZE FOR FREEZING PROPERTY TAXES SO THAT SENIORS DID NOT LOSE THEIR HOMES. I DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR THE FACT THAT WE ELIMINATED THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON HOME SALES. WE ALSO DID SOMETHING THE WAS IMPORTANT FOR FAMILIES LIKE DOUBLE THE CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT. WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH OUR INCOME TAX. PEOPLE OF THE BOTTOM END OF THE TAX SPECTRUM WOULD NOT BE PAYING MORE. THERE WERE TAX CUTS THAT WERE TARGETED FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WERE WORKING PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT FOR THE NEXT RUNG ON THE LATTER. THOSE OF THE KIND OF TAX CUTS THAT WE DID. WE HAD 90% AND DEMOCRATS IN THE LEGISLATURE. THAT IS NOT BAD. [APPLAUSE] WE PASSED A MARRIAGE AMENDMENT IN OUR STATE. I WENT OUT AND I WORKED FOR IT. BY 7% OF THE VOTE, OUR PEOPLE SAID THAT MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND WOMAN. WE HAVE TO DO THAT AT A FEDERAL LEVEL. IT IS NOT BECAUSE WE'RE AGAINST ANYBODY. IF WE DO NOT HAVE STRONG FAMILIES AND MARRIAGES, WE DO NOT HAVE A STRONG FUTURE. THIS IS WHERE WE TRAIN OUR REPLACEMENTS. THAT IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. [APPALSUE] I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE I WANT IT SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN HAVE A SAFER AMERICA THAN THEY ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. THE FACT IS, WE PUT OUR HEADS IN THE PILLOW AND WE WONDER IF THE TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY OF HORRIBLE TERRORIST ATTACKS. I KNOW I HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR SOME THINGS. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE 9/11 HAPPENED, WE HAVE NOT HAD ANOTHER TERRORIST ATTACK ON OUR SOIL. I WILL GIVE THE PRESIDENT CREDIT FOR THAT. [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT, I WANT TO MAKE IT SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WILL LIVE IN MAY THAT THESE TO HAVE TO PUT YOUR TOOTHPASTE IN A PLASTIC BAG BEFORE YOU GOT ON ANY AIRPLANE. MY CHILDREN LAUGH ABOUT MY DAYS DURING THE COLD WAR. I TOLD THEM ABOUT HOW WE PRACTICED THAT DRILL A DUCK AND COVER. SOME PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING. THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE IT AS WELL. DID I REALLY THINK THE CROSS HAIRS OF THE SOVIET UNION WERE POINTED AT MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR THEIR FIRST LAUNCH? THERE WERE PROBABLY MORE STRATEGIC TARGETS IN MY GRADE SCHOOL. IT ALSO A LETTER OCCURRED TO ME THAT EVEN IF MY GRADE SCHOOL HAD BEEN THE TARGET OF A NUCLEAR BLAST, WHAT WOULD IT HAVE DONE IT TO CURL UNDER MY WOODEN DESK? I WOULD HAVE BEEN VAPORIZED ANYWAY. IT WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED. WHEN I TALK TO MY CHILDREN ABOUT THE DRILLS AND HOW WE USED TO THINK ABOUT THE SOVIETS, THEY LAUGH AND THEY SAY -- THEY ASK ME IF THAT IS REALLY WHAT I DID. I WANT TO MAKE THE NEXT GENERATION SAFE SO THAT SOMEDAY OUR CHILDREN LAUGH AT US WHEN WE TELL THEM OUR -- TELL THEM ABOUT THE THINGS WE DID RIGHT NOW BRIDGE. WE HAVE A PROBLEM BRIT IT IS OUT OF HAND AND WE ALL KNOW IT. WE CAN FIX IT. WASHINGTON HAS NOT FIXED IT. THEY HAVE HAD MORE THAN 20 YEARS TO DEAL WITH IT. I DOUBT THAT OF ELECTING SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN WASHINGTON AND WIEHL DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. WHY WOULD WE GIVE THEM A BIGGER THING IF THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED ON A? AS A GOVERNOR, I HAD TO MAKE DECISIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY. I MADE ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE ANGRY. THAT IS PART OF POLITICS. THE LONGER YOU STAY IN OFFICE, THOUGH -- THE MORE PEOPLE YOU MAKE MAD. IT IS PART OF THE WAY IT WORKS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT A PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE -- IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS. IF I HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS, I WILL DECIDE THAT AMERICA WILL BE STRONGER, NOT WEAKER. WE WILL HAVE A MILITARY THAT NOBODY WANTS TO MESS WITH. IF THEY DO MESS WITH US, THEY WILL WISH THAT THEY HAVE NOT. IF WE EVER HAVE TO ENGAGE, I PRAY THAT WE DO NOT, BUT IF WE DO, WILL NOT HAVE POLITICIANS INTERFERING WITH THE BATTLEFIELD COMMANDERS TO HAVE TO MAKE LIFE- AND-DEATH DECISIONS. WE DO NOT LET POLITICIANS INTERFERE WITH THOSE DECISIONS. WE STAND BESIDE THOSE WHEN WE SEND THEM. WE STAND BESIDE THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME AND WE TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS AND WE DO NOT MAKE THEM WAIT IN LINE. [APPLAUSE] TOMORROW NIGHT IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT NIGHT FOR THE PROCESS OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. I HAVE BEEN OUTSPENT 20 TO ONE IN THIS DAY. IF THERE EVER WAS A DEFINITION OF UNDERDOG -- LOOK IN THE DICTIONARY, THERE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF ME. MOST PEOPLE DO NOT THINK A GUY LIKE ME COULD DO IT. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS COUNTRY, THERE WERE SOME FARMERS WITH MUSKETS AND NOBODY THOUGHT THEY COULD BE THE BRITISH. THEY HAD THOSE NICE UNIFORMS. THEY HAD ALL THOSE SHINY RED COATS. THAT THOSE NICE LONGER RIFLES MANUFACTURED CAREFULLY. THEY HAD UNLIMITED AMMUNITION. THEY HAD AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF SOLDIERS. THEY HAD A MAGNIFICENT NAVY. OUR PEOPLE HAD A FEW ROWS WITH A CAN AND ATTACHED TO THE FRONT OF A ROWBOAT. WE HAD A BUNCH OF FARMERS. WE ALSO HAD THE HELP OF THE FRENCH. THEY SAID TO GIVE US LIBERTY OR GIVE US DEATH. THEY PUT THEIR NAMES ON A DOCUMENT CALLED THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THERE WERE NOT JUST SIGNING UP TO SEE IF THEY COULD GET -- THERE WERE SIGNING UP TO AN KNOW THAT IF THIS DID NOT WORK, THERE WERE DEAD AND SO WERE THEIR FAMILIES. THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE PUTTING ON THE LINE. THEY WERE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO GO AGAINST YOUR KING. TO SAY WITH TO YOUR MOTHER COUNTRY THAT THERE IS NO TYRANNY. THEY HAD A RADICAL IDEA ABOUT HOW IT WOULD BE GOVERNED. THEY SAID ALL OF US WERE EQUAL. PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE MORE EQUAL BECAUSE OF THEIR ANCESTRY. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE MORE EQUAL BECAUSE OF THEIR LAST NAME. WHAT AN UNUSUAL IDEA TO TAKE HOLD IN 1776. IN THAT DAY AND TIME, TO THINK THAT A PERSON WHO GREW UP A PEASANT HAD THE SAME QUALITY AND INTRINSIC WORTH AS THE PERSON BUT A BLOODLINE FROM A KING, THAT WAS A RADICAL CONCEPT. IT IS THE REASON WE'RE SEEING -- IT IS THE REASON WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY. MY BLOODLINE DID NOT GO BACK TO THE QUEEN OR KING. MY PEOPLE DID NOT COME OVER ON THE MAYFLOWER. AND MY FATHER SAID AND DO NOT LOOK FAR OF THAT FAMILY TREE BECAUSE THERE IS SOME STUFF THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. MY ANCESTORS WERE DUMPED INTO THE DEBTORS' PRISONS IN GEORGIA. MY FATHER WORKED TWO JOBS BRICKNER -- MY FATHER WORKED TWO JOBS. MY MOTHER GREW UP ONE OF SEVEN CHILDREN. SHE WAS THE OLDEST. SHE HAD OUTDOOR TOILET. SHE WORKED TO MAKE SURE THAT HER SIBLINGS HAD ENOUGH TO EAT. MY PARENTS HAD ONE GOAL THAT THEY REALLY WANTED. THEY WANTED MY SISTER AND I TO DO BETTER THAN THEY HAD. AND THEY DID NOT WANT US TO EXPERIENCE WHAT THEY HAD DONE THROUGH THAT WORLD WAR AND THAT DEPRESSION. THEY DID BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY, NO MATTER WHERE WE STARTED -- WE HAD NO OF CHOICE ABOUT THAT. WE HAD A CHOICE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE NOW. BECAUSE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS HAD THIS IDEA, WE ARE ALL EQUAL. IT DOES NOT MEAN WE ALL STARTED OUT WITH A NET INCOME. PEOPLE KNEW MY FATHER FROM THE SHIPYARD. MY POINT IN ALL OF THAT IS, WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY. WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY. A KID LIKE ME COULD NOT ONLY BECOME THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, BUT WITH YOUR HELP TOMORROW NIGHT, WILL BECOME THE 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ONLY IN AMERICA CAN THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] SOMETIMES WHEN AND NEGATIVE ATTACKS ARE COMING AND THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME MUCH HOSTILITY, PEOPLE ASK ME THAT I DO NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH BOTHERED BY IT. I STILL SEEM OF BEAT. WHAT WOULD I BE? NO MATTER HOW THIS ELECTION TURNS OUT, I AM -- I LIVE IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. I CANNOT KEEP IT THAT WAY IF I SPEND MORE TIME DESTROYING OTHER CANDIDATES THAN REMINDING PEOPLE WHAT OUR FUTURE SHOULD BE ABOUT. TOMORROW NIGHT, IF YOU GO OUT AND CAUCUS FOR ME, I WILL TELL YOU, THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF AMERICA WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN EVER. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO BE OUTSPENT LIKE ME AND WIND BREADTH -- AND WIN A. IT WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE OF IOWA. NO ONE WILL EVER BLOWOFF WHILE OGDEN. -- WILL EVER BLOW OFF IOWA. IT IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU STAND FOR SOMETHING AND STILL STAND FOR IT NO MATTER WHAT. [APPLAUSE] TOMORROW NIGHT, I WANT YOU TO JOIN ME IN PROVING THAT IN IOWA, VOTERS ARE NOT FOR SALE. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP ME PROVE THAT VOTERS ARE NOT EVEN FOR RENT. PEOPLE HERE VOTE BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN THEIR CONVICTIONS. AT CHECKBOOK WAVED IN THEIR FACE DOES NOT IMPRESS THEM. NO MATTER HOW MANY TELEVISION ADS AND RADIO ADS THAT COME DURING YOUR EARNED DINNER HOUR, WHEN IT STILL COMES DOWN TO IS, YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS AUTHENTIC, CONSISTENT, AND SOMEONE WHO CAN LEAD AND HAS THE EXPERIENCE. THERE IS AN AFFIRMATION THAT HE HAS DONE SOMETHING RIGHT. I I KNOW THAT IT WOULD UPSET THE CHATTERING CLASS' IF I WOULD WIND LAST NIGHT. THEY HAVE HAD A FIELD DAY TO FIGURE OUT HOW ON EARTH I HAVE HAD THIS SURGE. I DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN EXPLAIN IT EITHER. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CANNOT. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT IN CAUCUS TOMORROW NIGHT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY WIN. IF WE COME IN SECOND PLACE, WE ARE STILL IN OUR PLACE AND MOVING ON. WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE STORY TO TELL. BY CONVENTIONAL POLITICAL WISDOM, THAT IS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. IF WE WIN, IT WILL BE THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE POLITICAL STORY IN DECADES. IT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME. I HELPED MAKE POLITICAL HISTORY. I HOPE YOU WILL DO THAT. TAMARA HISTORY -- TOMORROW NIGHT, DO NOT BE CAUGHT SITTING HOME PREPARING FOR THE ORANGE BOWL. [LAUGHTER] YOU NEED TO GET OUT TOMORROW NIGHT AND CAUCUS FOR ME. LOAD UP YOUR CAR IN YOUR VAN. RENT A VAN OR A BIG BUST. GET OUT THERE AND CAUCUS. TAKE FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AND PEOPLE FROM WORK. WHEN YOU GET OUT THERE, STAND FIRM, STANDS TALL, AND KEEP STANDING UNTIL LAST VOTES COUNT. IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WILL NOT VOTE FOR ME, PUT ALL YOUR SNOW IN YOUR DRIVEWAY AND DO NOT LET THEM OUT. KEEP THEM FROM GOING ANYWHERE. ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF AERODYNAMICS AND SCIENCE, BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE BUMBLEBEE AND ITS WINGSPAN, IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BUMBLE BEE TO FLY. THE BUMBLE BEE, BEING UNAWARE OF THESE SCIENTIFIC FACTS GOES AHEAD AND FLIES ANYWAY. IT HAS CONFUSED AERONAUTICS FOR A LONG TIME. BY ALL CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OF HOW POLITICS ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK, THERE IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD I WOULD BE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT. I WOULD LIKE YOU, BEING UNAWARE OF THESE CONVENTIONAL POLITICAL FAXED TO GO OUT THERE AND GET YOUR FRIENDS TO GO WITH YOU, SOME TIME FOR THE FIRST -- SOME FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER TO CAUCUS. TOMORROW NIGHT, PROOF THAT THIS COUNTRY IS NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY, IT IS ABOUT ITS FUTURE. I PROMISE I WILL GIVE YOU MY VERY BEST. I WILL MAKE MISTAKES. I HAVE MADE A FEW BEFORE. WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WISH I HAD MADE. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT A FINANCIAL SITUATION AS A COUNTRY, I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT THE WAR IF WE HAVE TO GET IN IT. I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIX SOME OF OUR PROBLEMS. I GIVE MY VERY BEST TO MAKE YOU PROUD AND TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY PROUD. THANK YOU FOR BEING OUT HERE TODAY. I APPRECIATE IT MORE THAN YOU COULD KNOW. AND GOD BLESS YOU AND I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT. LET US HAVE A GREAT NIGHT OF A VICTORY IN IOWA. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS. [APPLAUSE] >> MIKE HUCKABEE FROM EARLIER TODAY IN FORT DODGE, IOWA. ONE OF HIS CHALLENGERS, MITT ROMNEY, IS MAKING NEWS.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?203190-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NONE HILLARY CLINTON FOR ALL OF MY LIFE. SHE HELD LEGISLATE MAKING ADOPTION EASIER. SHE BECAME FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS AND ONE OF THE TOP 100 LAWYERS IN AMERICA. SHE WAS ALWAYS FIRST A MOTHER. I WONDERED WHICH WAS EASIER. WHEN BILL CLINTON BEGAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, SOME OF MY CO- WORKERS AS TO HE WAS AND I SAID THAT HE WAS HILLARY CLINTON'S HUSBAND. I WAS AMAZED BY HER MORE OF A COMPASSIONATE. SHE WAS FUN AND SHE MADE US ALL LAUGH. LAST FALL I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. I ONLY THEN HAVE LEARNED ALL OF WHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD DONE. SHOULD THE FIRST WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE WITH A BREAST CANCER EXPERT. THIS LED TO INCREASED FUNDING FOR RESEARCH. SHE HELD HEARINGS TO EXPLORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES OF CANCER. I AM PROFOUNDLY AND DENTED TO HILLARY. SHE HAS A START OF MY VERY LIFE AND THAT IS WHAT SHE WILL DO FOR ALL OF US AS PRESIDENT. EARLY INTERVENTION AND THE TREATMENT CAN PREVENT A LONG RANGE OF NATION OF SIX PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY FOLLOW THE PLAN THAT SHE HAS FORGED FOR THE LAST 36 PEOPLE -- 36 YEARS. -- THE PLAN FOR THE SICK PEOPLE. SHE HAS TRAVELED A THE COUNTRY'S AILING DIPLOMACY AND GIVING SPEECHES. -- SHE HAS TRAVELED TO 80 COUNTRIES. IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE GOVERNOR OF THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES. PLEASE WELCOME THE OHIO GOV. TED STRICKLAND. [APPLAUSE] >> IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. THEY WERE CARD IN OUR PATRIOTIC. -- THEY WORK HARD AND THEY ARE PATRIOTIC. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE A LOT TO SHARE WITH HE AND WHAT I HAVE CHOSEN TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE PRESIDENCY. I'VE MADE MY DECISION SOME MONTHS AGO AND I WILL SHARE TO YOU WITH WHAT I SAID. I LIKE AND ADMIRE HER. I HAVE WATCHED FOR OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AS SHE HAS WORKED TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER COUNTRY. I HAVE ADMIRED HER AS A SENATOR AND A FIRST LADY. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT OHIO. OHIO WAS DOMINATED COMPLETELY BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS. @Td%# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUT NOT ONLY WAS I ELECTED, WE ELECTED A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, A SECRETARY OF STATE WHO WILL PROPERLY AND ACCURATELY COUNT YOUR VOTES. AND WE ELECTED AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND A TREASURY OF THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. I WOULD NOT BE HERE, I WOULD NOT HAVE ENDORSED THE SENATOR EXCEPT FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST OF ALL, I AM CONVINCED IN MY SOUL THAT IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, WHEN WE NEED A STRONG LEADER, I AM CONVINCED THAT SHE IS THE PERSON WHO IS BY FAR THE MOST QUALIFIED TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY AND TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT THERE'S A SECOND REASON, AND THE SECOND REASON IS THIS. I AM CONVINCED THAT SHE IS THE ONE WHO CAN STAND UP TO THE PRESSURE, CAN TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE OPPOSITION, AND CAN WIN ON NOVEMBER 4, 2008. [ APPLAUSE ] SHE'S BEEN THERE. SHE HAS ENDURED THE ARROWS. THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY COULD POSSIBLY DO TO A HUMAN BEING TO TEAR HER DOWN, AND SHE HAS STOOD FIRM AND FAST. AND SHE HAS REMAINED STANDING WHILE MANY OF HER DETRACTORS ARE NO LONGER AROUND. THE FACT IS THAT WHOEVER THE DEMOCRATS NOMINATE WILL BECOME A TARGET. WE KNOW THAT. WE KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO SENATOR JOHN KERRY, DON'T WE? AND THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. BUT SENATOR CLINTON IS THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS BEEN VETTED. SHE'S THE ONE WHO HAS STOOD UP TO THEM YEAR AFTER YEAR AND CONFRONTED THE TOUGH ISSUES. SHE'S WORKED TO BRING HEALTH CARE TO OUR NATION, ESPECIALLY TO OUR CHILDREN. SHE HAS WORKED FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY. SHE HAS WORKED TO PROMOTE THE PROGRAMS THAT GIVE OUR SENIORS CONFIDENCE IN THEIR RETIREMENT YEARS. SHE HAS MET WITH, CONSULTED WITH LEADERS FROM OVER 80 COUNTRIES. THERE IS NO ONE WHO COMES CLOSE TO HAVING HER QUALIFY OCCASIONS TO ENTER THE PRESIDENCY. AND SO, I'M SO PROUD OF HER. I'M PROUD OF WHAT SHE'S ACCOMPLISHED. I'M PROUD OF HER COMPASSION AND HOME RUN COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE. AND I'VE COME HERE TO IOWA, NOT TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO, BUT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT'S IN MY HEART AS THE GOVERNOR OF A KEY BATTLE GROUND STATE. IF YOU WILL STAND UP FOR THIS GOOD SENATOR ON CAUCUS NIGHT, I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL DELIVER OHIO FOR HER ON NOVEMBER 4, 2008. [ APPLAUSE ] I AM SO PLEASED AND, QUITE FRANKLY, VERY PROUD TO BE STANDING HERE AND HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF INTRODUCING TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OUR SENATOR, SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE GOVERNOR STRICTLAND TRAVELING WITH ME TODAY. HE'S BEEN A REAL TROOPER. THIS IS OUR THIRD STOP AND I'M SO GRATEFUL HE CAN TAKE TIME OUT FROM HIS BUSY SCHEDULE. IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT HE LED A LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR DEMOCRATS IN OHIO, AND HE'S DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB. HIS APPROVAL RATINGS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. THE REPUBLICANS EVEN LIKE HIM, AS WELL AS THE INDEPENDENTS. THE DEMOCRATS ARE WILD ABOUT HIM. HE KNOWS A THING OR TWO TO WIN ELECTIONS AND KNOWS OHIO. THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE GOES THROUGH OHIO. THANK YOU GOVERNOR STRICKLAND FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE, YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR HELP. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I SURE WANT TO THANK PAT FOR BEING HERE, ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND, RON. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY GOOD OF HER. I APPRECIATE HER STEPPING FORWARD AS ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF IOWANS WHO ARE PLANNING TO CAUCUS FOR ME ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND SHARING HER PERSONAL STORY. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY TO STAND UP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND TALK ABOUT HAVING CANCER, BUT I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT SHE DID, BECAUSE I INTEND, WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, TO PUT EVERY THING WE CAN INTO THE BATTLE AGAINST CANCER, ALL KIND OF CANCER. WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE RESEARCH BUDGET, WE'LL FIND NEW WAYS TO DETECT AND TREAT CANCER, AND WHILE I'M DOING THAT IN WASHINGTON, I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT PAT AND KNOWING THAT SHE HAS REALLY RAISED THIS ISSUE AS IT SHOULD BE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND STATE SENATOR ROGER STEWART WHO IS HERE. THANK YOU, AGAIN, ROGER FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND YOUR SUPPORT. [ APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO THANK MY COUNTY COORDINATOR, CHUCK SCHULTZ. THANK YOU, CHUCK, VERY MUCH. I WANT TO THANK STATE REPRESENTATIVE TOM SHULER AND HIS WIFE MELANIE. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. [ APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO CRANK THE COUNTY ATTORNEY FOR BEING THE LOCAL MP. I WANT TO THANK DAVID GLASS FOR HIS MUSICAL PERFORMANCE AND I WANT TO THANK RICH FOR BEING THE FIELD ORGANIZER FROM JACKSON COUNTY. I WANT TO THANK LANNIE AND THE REST OF THE STAFF HERE AT THE JACKSON FAIR GROUND AND MY OTHER KIFRTORS TO RAISE YOUR HAND BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD YOU ARE ALL WORKING. ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS UPCOMING CAUCUS. YOU KNOW, IT IS GETTING MORE AND MORE ENERGIZING EVERY WHERE I GO AROUND THE STATE. SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DECIDING. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS AND THEY ARE COMING OUT JUST TO GET GEARED UP AND READY TO DO ALL THE WORK WE HAVE TO DO TO TURN OUT A GREAT SHOWING IN THE CAUCUSES. SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL UNDECIDED, UNCERTAIN, MAKING UP THEIR MINDS, BUT TAKING THIS PROCESS SO SERIOUSLY, AND THAT'S WHAT I ADMIRE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS DEMOCRACY AT ITS BEST. THIS IS AMERICANS COMING FORWARD TO PICK A PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, KIND OF GIVES ME GOOSE BUMPS BECAUSE IT STARTS HERE AND STARTS WITH ALL OF YOU. SOMETIMES, IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL WE CAN TAKE OUR DEMOCRACY FOR GRANTED, CAN'T WE? WHEN SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENS LIKE WE SAW THURSDAY IN PAKISTAN WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF BENAZIR BHUTTO, SOMEONE WHO I HAD KNOWN FOR MORE THAN 12 YEARS, WHOSE LEADERSHIP I ADMIRED, WHO WENT BACK TO PAKISTAN TO RUN FOR ELECTION AGAIN, KNOWING THAT HER LIFE WAS UNDER THREAT. I MEAN AL QAEDA HAS THREATENED HER FOR YEARS. AND YET SHEBLD SO STRONGLY IN THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHO THEIR LEADERS SHOULD BE. THAT SHE TOOK THAT INCREDIBLE RISK AND IT WAS A PERSONAL TRAGEDY AS WELL AS A GREAT SETBACK FOR DEMOCRACY AND STABILITY IN PAKISTAN. BUT WHAT IT ALSO DID WAS TO REMIND US HOW PRECIOUS OUR FREEDOM IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE ALL PLAY OUR PART IN CONTINUING THE LONGEST, LASTING DEMOCRACY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. SO, ON THURSDAY NIGHT, YOU ALL GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. TO STAND UP, TO CAUCUS, THE EYES OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD WILL BE ON YOU. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS JUST WAITING, WAITING. THERE WILL BE A GREAT SIGH OF RELIEF FROM THE ENTIRE WORLD WHEN GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE. [ APPLAUSE ] AND ON JANUARY 20, 2009, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE SWORN IN. AND WAITING ON THE DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE WILL BE SO MANY PROBLEMS. JUST THINK ABOUT IT. A WAR TO RESOLVE IN AFGHANISTAN. AN ECONOMY THAT'S STARTING TO SHOW SOME TROUBLING SIGNS, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HOME OWNERSHIP, WHERE 6,700 PEOPLE IN IOWA TODAY ARE BEING FORECLOSED ON WITH NO END IN SIGHT. HOUSING VALUES HAVE DROPPED. THAT'S THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF WEALTH FOR MOST AMERICANS. WE ARE IN DEBT TO COUNTRIES FROM CHINA TO MEXICO. WE BORROW MONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. WE HAVE 47 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS, MILLIONS MORE WHO ARE, IN EFFECT, WITHOUT INSURANCE BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WON'T PAY FOR THE BILLS THAT THEY HAVE AFTER THEIR DOCTOR TELLS THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. WE HAVE SO MANY CHALLENGES THAT WE KNOW ABOUT HERE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND YET I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS THAT COME IN TO THIS DOOR OF THAT OVAL OFFICE THAT NONE OF US CAN PREDICT. SO, IF WE BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PICKING A PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO PICK SOMEONE WHO WE'RE CONFIDENT IN TO START LEADING ON DAY ONE. WHO CAN HANDLE ALL THE PROBLEMS WE KNOW ABOUT AND EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY RUNNING FOR THE NOMINATION OF OUR PARTY IS IN FAVOR OF CHANGE. SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU BRING ABOUT CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT. SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU BRING ABOUT CHANGE BY HOPING FOR IT. I THINK YOU BRING ABOUT CHANGE BY WORKING REALLY, REALLY HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE FOR 35 YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] I KNOW THAT CHANGE IS HARD. CHANGE IS HARD IN OUR OWN LIVES. CHANGE IS HARD, YOU KNOW, IN ANY ACTIVITY YOU'RE A PART OF. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND CAN DELIVER ON CHANGE FOR OUR COUNTRY. 35 YEARS AGO I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR A LAW FIRM. I WANTED TO GO TO WORK REPRESENTING AND HELPING KIDS. KIDS WHO WERE ABUSED OR NEGLECTED. KIDS WHO WERE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. KIDS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. SO I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. AND I WAS PART OF A GROUP THAT WANTED TO MAKE A BIG CHANGE IN AMERICA. WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE SHUT OUT OF MOST OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THERE WASN'T ANY PLACE FOR THEM. THERE WASN'T ANY WAY TO ACCOMMODATE THEM. SO I AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, WE WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR ASKING PEOPLE, DO YOU HAVE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WHO AREN'T IN SCHOOL? I WAS INVITED INTO SMALL APARTMENTS AND MODEST HOMES AND INTRODUCED TO BLIND CHILDREN AND CHILDREN IN WHEELCHAIRS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THEM. AND SO WE PRESENTED THE EVIDENCE AND I'M VERY PROUD THAT OUR COUNTRY BECAME THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT MADE IT A LAW THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE ENTITLED TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION. THAT'S THE KINDS OF POSITIVE CHANGE THAT TRANSFORMS LIVES. [ APPLAUSE ] WHEN I WENT TO ARKANSAS I WORKED ON BEHALF OF RURAL HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION REFORM. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A POOR STATE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE REALLY LEFT OUT. AND I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED, MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE WAY I WAS RAISED BY MY FAMILY, MAYBE BECAUSE OF WHAT I LEARNED GOING TO SUNDAY SCHOOL AND CHURCH THAT I HAD AN OBLIGATION TO GIVE BACK AND SO I BEGAN TO WORK ON HOW WE GET HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE IT AND HOW WE GIVE EVERY KID NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVED A CHANCE FOR A GOOD ED CASE. WE CHANGED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF LIVES. THEN WHEN I WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH BILL THERE WERE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WAITING. I REMEMBER THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION, THE DEFICIT WAS $150 BILLION IT WAS OVER $250 BILLION AND HE WORKED SO HARD AND CHANGED OUR ECONOMIC FORTUNES, LEADING TO A BALANCED GUJ IN THE SURPLUS AND CREATING 22 MILLION JOBS AND LIFTING MORE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. SO THE CHANGE WAS HARD BUT LOOK AT THE EFFECTS. AND THEN I WENT TO WORK ON TRYING TO PROVIDE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SAID THAT'S JUST TOO HARD, LET'S JUST DO SOCIAL SECURITY. HARRY TRUMAN TRIED. COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE. IT'S HARD TO DO. BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING. IT'S A MORAL AND ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAVE ACTHE ESTO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. SO WE WESTERN SUCCESSFUL BUT I'M PROUD WE TRIED BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING. THEN PEOPLE SAID SHE WILL NEVER TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AGAIN. AND I SAID WELL YOU DON'T KNOW ME VERY WELL. BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF YOU DON'T SUCCEED AT FIRST YOU TRY AND TRY AGAIN. I HELPED CREATE THE VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM AND NOW 20,000 CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINES. THEN I WENT TO WORK ON CANCER AND CONVENED THE FIRST-EVER WHITE HOUSE MEETING ON BREAST CANCER AND WORKED TO MAKE MA'AMO GRAMS FOR AFFORDABLE FOR WOMEN. THEN I WORKED AGAINST DRUG COMPANIES WHO DIDN'T PRESCRIBE DRUGS FOR KIDS. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE FDA TO CHANGE THE REGULATION TO REQUIRE DRUG COMPANIES TO DO IT. THEY WENT TO COURT. SUED. OVERTURNED IT. I BECAME A UNITED STATES SENATOR AND I PASSED A LAW REQUIRING THAT THE DRUG COMPANIES TEST DRUGS ON CHILDREN BEFORE THEY ARE PRESCRIBED TO THEM. [ APPLAUSE ] I WAS PROUD TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY AT THE 1995 U.N. CONFERENCE ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND I WENT THERE AGAINST THE DESIRES OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO SAY WHAT I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND WE BELIEVE EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS BUT WE KNOW COUNTRY WHO OPPRESS WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC, MORE LIKELY TO BE ADVERSE SERIAL TO THE UNITED STATES. YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PAKISTAN, PART OF THE REASON IS PEOPLE DON'T GET EDUCATED THE LITERACY RATE AMONG WOMEN IS BELOW 38%. WE NEEDED A FOREIGN POLICY THAT SAYS WE WANT TO LIFT UP EVERYTHING BECAUSE BY DOING THAT WE WOULD MAKE THE WORLD SAFER FOR OUR CHILDREN. SO I KNEW THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO WHETHER OR NOT WOMEN IN FAR AWAY PLACES HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO SCHOOL, HAD A CHANCE TO DO A BUSINESS, HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE FOR THEIR LEADERS AND THEN I WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO HELP CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW IT AS THE HAWKEYE PROGRAM. 50,000 CHILDREN IN IOWA HAVE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT POOR ENOUGH TO QUALIFY FOR FREE AID BUT THEY SURE DIDN'T HAVE FAMILIES THAT MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD INSURANCE AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE, YOU KNOW, GOOD UNION CONTRACTS OR EMPLOYERS WHO HELPED PROVIDE THAT INSURANCE. SO WE COVERED SIX MILLION KIDS. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THERE'S STILL 50,000 IN IOWA THAT HAVE NO INSURANCE AND NINE MILLION IN THE COUNTRY. SO I HAVE WORKED AS A BIPARTISAN BASIS TO EXPAND THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE. GEORGE BUSH HAS VETOED IT TWICE. IN NOVEMBER 2008 WE'LL VETO GEORGE BUSH'S POLICY AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT I'M GOING TO SIGN IT SO CHILDREN IN IOWA AND AMERICA HAVE HEALTH CARE. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, WHEN I WNT TO THE SENATE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID SHE WILL NEVER WORK WITH THE REPUBLICANS AND THEY WILL NEVER WORK WITH HER. THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU GET THINGS DONE. YOU GOT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ON EVERYTHING. YOU CAN GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT WORKING WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH. SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY TO ME HOW CAN YOU STAND POLITICS? I SAY HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A MEMBER OF A CHURCH? [ LAUGHTER ] POLITICS ARE EVERY WHERE. IN A DEMOCRACY YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH HEM. YOU GOT TO GET FOLKS TO COME TO YOUR SIDE. IT'S NOT EASY BUT SURE IS WORTH DOING. WHEN I LEARNED THAT OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS DID NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE UNLESS THEY HAD IT IN THEIR CIVILIAN JOBS, I WAS DUMBFOUNDED. YOU KNOW, HERE OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES, MEMBERS MOSTLY YOUNGISH, THEY ARE SELF EMPLOYED A LOT OF THEM, WORK FOR EMPLOYERS WHO DON'T GIVE THEM INSURANCE, SO WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVATED, THEY WERE DISCOVERED TO HAVE THESE MEDICAL PROBLEMS THAT NOBODY EVER DIAGNOSED OR TREATED. SO I TAEMD UP WITH A REPUBLICAN SENATOR, I SERVED WITH BY THE NAME OF LINDSAY GRAHAM BECAUSE HE SAW THE SAME THING CHLG I HAD 20% OF MY RESERVE AND GUARD MEMBERS IN NEW YORK. WE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AND OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE PENTAGON AND OVER A THREAT OF A VETO FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WE PASSED IT. SO NOW NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES DO HAVE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING 7,500 RIGHT HERE IN IOWA AND THAT'S THE KIND OF POSITIVE CHANGE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. [ APPLAUSE ] I'VE WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS ON A RANGE OF ISSUES. IN FACT, I THINK IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I INTRODUCED FAR MORE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION THAN ANY OTHER SENATOR BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO BUILD THOSE BRIDGES, BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. I KNOW HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND I KNOW HOW TO STAND MY GROUND. SO IN 2004, AFTER GEORGE BUSH WAS ELECTED AGAIN, HE BEGAN TO TRY TO PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY. REMEMBER THAT? HE WAS DETERMINED THAT HE WAS GOING TO END SOCIAL SECURITY AS WE KNOW IT. AND I WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE SENATE THAT SAID NOT TODAY, NOT TOMORROW, NOT EVER. I WILL NEVER EVER ALLOW THE PRIVATIZATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY. AND WE BEAT HIM BACK. WE STOOD OUR GROUND. BUT I HAVE TO SAY I DIDN'T THINK I COULD BE SURPRISED BY ANYTHING THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID ANY MORE. THEN ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS NOT ONLY SURPRISED I WAS SHOCKED. BECAUSE I LEARNED THAT THE PENTAGON WAS TRYING TO GO TO WOUNDED SOLDIERS WHO HAD ENLISTED IN THE MULL TEAR AND RECEIVED A SIGNING BONUS AND GET THE MONEY BACK. THE ARGUMENT WENT WE GAVE YOU A SIGNING BONUS WHEN YOU SIGNED UP FOR A TWO OR FOUR YEAR TOUR OF DUTY. YOU WERE INJURED IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN. YOU CAN FULFILL YOUR TERM OF THE CONTRACT SO WE WANT THE MONEY BACK. I SAID AGAIN, OVER MY DEAD BODY. SO I TAEMD UP WITH ANOTHER REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND I'M PLEASED TO TELL YOU WE PASSED LEGISLATION PROHIBITING THE PENTAGON FROM ENGAGING IN SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR FROM TAKING BACK SIGNING BONUSES FROM OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY. WHY DO I TELL YOU SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE OVER THE COURSE OF MY 35 YEARS OF WORK ON BEHALF OF OTHER PEOPLE? WELL, IT'S KINDS MUCH SIMPLE. BECAUSE, YOU SEE, I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR YOU TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF CHANGES I WILL MAKE IS TO LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE DONE. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH ON ME. I'M ASKING YOU TO EXAMINE, TO CONSIDER, AND TO EVALUATE WHAT I HAVE DONE. AND THE KIND OF POSITIVE CHANGE I'VE ALREADY MADE BECAUSE TO MAKE CHANGE YOU HAVE TO HAVE EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE STRENGTH TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO IT. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE THAT I CAN MUSTER TO GET INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AND BEGIN TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT AMERICA DESPERATELY REQUIRES. BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW BEGINNING. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW BEGINNING IN HEALTH CARE. YOU KNOW, IT IS TIME. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO SEE THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF UNINSURED PEOPLE THE DENIAL OF CARE, THE REAL DISAFFECTION OF DOCTORS, NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, HOSPITALS LIVING ON THE EDGE. WE GOT CHANGE THE WAY WE FINANCE HEALTH CARE. SO I PROPOSE THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN. IT'S REAL SIMPLE. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE THAT YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH, YOU NEGOTIATED FOR IT, IT'S SECURE, YOUR DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT, IT COVERS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, NOTHING CHANGES. BUT IF YOU ARE UNINSURED OR DON'T HAVE INSURANCE THAT COVERS WHAT YOU NEED OR COSTS TOO MUCH WE'LL GIVE YOU NEW CHOICES. WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH PLAN TO EVERY AMERICAN. CONGRESS HAS A GREAT PLAN FOR ITSELF AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. OVER 250 CHOICES, EITHER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS THAT'S NOT GOVERNMENT RUN MEDICINE, YOU KNOW, NOT THE KINDS OF BUREAUCRACY THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT. IT ALREADY EXISTS. IT JUST TAKES CARE OF SOMEBODY BESIDES YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. AND IT'S ON AVERAGE CHEAPER THAN WHAT YOU CAN BUY ON THE PRIVATE MARKET OR GET THROUGH AN EMPLOYER BECAUSE THE TAXPAYERS PAY FOR 75% OF IT. SO I FIGURE IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONGRESS IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR AMERICA. SO WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THAT PLAN AND WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU AND YOU AND YOU DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO GO INTO IT. AND IT'S GOT GREAT COVERAGE. IT COVERS MENTAL HEALTH. EVERY HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN SHOULD COVER MENTAL HEALTH BUT A LOT OF THEM DON'T. IT COVERS PREVENTION WHICH IS A WAY TO HELP YOU STAY WELL INSTEAD OF TAKING CARE OF YOU AFTER YOU GET SICK. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS SO THAT INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY THE HEALTH CARE. WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT HOW MUCH ANY PERSON HAS TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE TO A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME. WE'RE GOING NO DERNIZE THE SYSTEM SO IT'S MORE EFFICIENT, DON'T HAVE SO MANY MISTAKES IN IT. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TO REALLY MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYBODY AGAIN. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS PLANNING THIS, PEOPLE SAID WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF CONTROVERSIAL TO COVER EVERY AMERICAN. THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN MEDICARE. MEDICARE WOULDN'T WORK IF WE DIDN'T COVER EVERY AMERICAN OVER 65. IT WOULDN'T WORK. THE REASON IT WORKS IS BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS IN IT. EVERYBODY CONTRIBUTES TO IT. SO I SAID WELL, IF WE LEAVE PEOPLE OUT WHO DO WE LEAVE OUT? WHERE DO I START? WE LEAVE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE ELDERLY. DO WE LEAVE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN DISEASE. DO I LEAVE OUT THE NURSE WHO HAS BREAST CANCER AND HER TREATMENTS WERE DIFFICULT THAT SHE COULDN'T GO WORK AN WHEN SHE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO GO BACK TO WORK THE HOSPITAL SAID YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB ANY MORE AND SHE LOST HER HEALTH NS. SHOULD I LEAVE OUT A YOUNG COUPLE THAT OWN AN AUTO BODY SHOP, WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN, GOT A COUPLE MUCH KIDS. RUGT NOW THEY ARE ALL HEALTHY SO LET'S LEAVE THEM OUT AN HOPE AN PRAY THEY NEVE GET IS BEING. I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAND AIDS ON OUR PROBLEMS, I'M RUNNING TO SOLVE THEM BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO START DONG IN AMERICA AGAIN. WE USED TO BE THE PROBLEM SOLVERS. WE USED TO BE THE PEOPLE THAT ROLLED UP OUR SLAVES -- SLEEVES AND GOT TO WORK. WHERE IS THAT SPIRIT CAN DO, WE'RE THE BEST. IT'S BEEN SAPPED OUT OF US BY GEORGE BUSH. HE CONVNSED US WE CAN'T SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A NEW AGAINST WHEN IT COMES TO NRJ. WE'RE DEPENDEN ON FOREIGN OIL FROM COUNTRIES THAT USE THE MONEY WE SEND THEM AGAINST US AND WE SIT AROUND AN TAK IT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER AREA. WE WASTE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE NEED TO BE MORE ENERGY FSHT. -- EFFICIENT. WE NEED TO GET THE GAS MILEAGE UP IN THE CARS. WE'RE THE PEOPLE WHO SENT A MAN TO THE MOON AND BROUGHT THEM BACK SAFELY. AMERICANS ARE GREAT PROBLEM SOLVERS. WE HAVE TO START ACTING LIKE AMERICANS AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE OUR ENERGY CRISIS, ENHANCE OUR SECURITY, DEAL WITH GLOBAL WARMING AND INCREASE OUR JOBS BY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. I'VE BEEN TO BIODIESEL PLANTS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN IOWA ARE WORKING IN CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. THAT CAN HAPPEN BY THE MILLIONS ACROSS AMERICA. WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO CREATE MORE JOBS AND FAIRFAX THE TAX CODE WHICH HAS GOTTEN SO OUT OF WHACK THAT IT FAVORS THE WEALTHY AND WELL CONNECTED. WE NEED A TAX CODE THAT REWARDS WORK AND REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS. THAT MEANS PUTTING THE MIDDLE CLASS FROM. THAT MEANS FOR ME ENDING THE TAX BREAK FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS. WE CAN BEGIN TO PUT IT RIGHT AGAIN. I KNOW WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING END ED KAS FAT. IS THE BUILDING BLOCK OF OUR SOCIETY. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE NEED TO HELP FAMILIES DO A BETTER JOB. THEN I WANT TO ENDS THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING FOR OUR TEACHERS, OUR STUDENTS AND OUR SCHOOLS. [ APPLAUSE ] LET'S MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN. WE CAN DO THAT. IT'S SO DIFFICULT FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES TO SENDS THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL NOW. I DON'T WANT TO FORGET THE KIDS WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE, A LOT OF DECENT, HARD-WORKING AMERICANS DON'T GO COLLEGE, DON'T GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD THE BUILDINGS THAT WE LIVE AND WORK IN. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT FIGHT THE WARSES WE WAGE. LET'S DO MORE FOR THEM WITH JOB TRAINING, APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND A GOOD STANDARD OF LIVING THAT WILL GET THEM TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. LET'S PUT THINGS IN OUR TAX CODE THAT MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS. THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO TO GET THIS ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN. SOMETIMES MY OPPONENTS WHEN I SAY WE KNOW HOW TO CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA, WE CREATED 22 MILLION OF THEM IN THE 1990S. THEY GO OH, THERE SHE GOES AGAIN TALKING ABOUT THE PAST. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANTION ROME I'M TALKING WHAT HAPPENED 10 YEARS AGO. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT GENERATES WEALTH AND PROSPERITY BROADLY AGAIN. WE CAN'T HAVING THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF GEORGE W. BUSH AND THE REPUBLICANS. THEY BANKRUPTED US. DROVE US INTO DEBT. SACRIFICED OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. THEY PUT $30,000 OF DEBT ON EVERY BABY BORN IN AMERICA EVERY SINGLE DAY. WELL I'M GOING TO RESERIOUS THAT. I WANT TO GET BACK WHERE WE'RE PROUD OF OUR ECONOMY AGAIN AND WHERE IT'S WORKING FOR EVERYBODY AGAIN AND ONE. WAYS WE'LL DO THAT IS REFORM THE GOVERNMENT SO IT'S NOT SO TILTED TO THE ALREADY WEALTHY AND WELL CONNECTED. WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE KRONYISM AND NOED BY CONTRACTS. LESS GETTING MEN TO QUALIFIED PEOPLE HOLDING THE JOB OF THAT ASKS THEM TO. THAT LED TO GET BACK TO YOU KNOW, FINALLY WE HAVE TO HAVE A NEW GIK WHEN IT COMES TO RESTORING THE LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY. I AM COMMITTED TO DOING THIS AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS I CAN. [APPLAUSE] AS SOON AS I AND PRESIDENT, I WOULD ASK THE JOINT CHIEFS AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO GIVE ME A PLAN SO WE CAN START WITHDRAWING THE TROOPS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE OUR CHILDREN SERVE AS REFEREES IN THIS WAR. THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE IRAQIS IS TO BEGIN WITH WITHDRAWN THE TROOPS. GEORGE BUSH HAS GIVEN THEM A BLANK CHECK. THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION. THEY ARE PROPPING UP THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT. THEY WILL HAVE TO START MAKING THE TOUGH DECISIONS. WHEN WE BRING OUR TROOPS HOME, LET'S TAKE CARE OF THEM. LET'S GIVE THEM THE HEALTH CARE AND THE COMPENSATION THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON RED TAPE FOR THE SOLDIERS AND TANKS SPIT TIME TALKING WITH SOME SOLDIERS -- I SPENT TIME TALKING WITH SOME SOLDIERS. THEY NEEDED CONTINUING CARE. THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY WERE IGNORED AND HOW THEY WERE WAREHOUSE. THAT IS DISGRACEFUL. IF SOMEBODY SERVED OUR COUNTRY, THEY TURN OUR SERVICE IN RETURN. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, THAT IS DESTINED TO BE ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES. IN ONE TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO PASS A NEW GI BILL OF RIGHTS. -- I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO PASS A NEW GI BILL OF RIGHTS. I WANT TO TAKE CARE ALL OF THE VETERANS BACK TO WORLD WAR II. AND THOSE WHO FOUGHT IN VIETNAM AND THEY WERE NOT GIVEN THE HEALTH AND RESPECT AND BANKS THAT THEY DESERVED. I AM CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN DO ALL OF THIS. I AM NOT AT ALL DISCOURAGED OR IN ANY WAY DOUBTFUL ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THE AMERICANS. I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF REPAIR WORK TO DO. THIS IS THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE ARE THE BEST ADS. DO WANT TO MAKE A BETTER TOMORROW. -- THIS IS WHAT WE ARE BEST AT. I CANNOT DO ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT. THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING FOR YOU TO COMPASS FOR ME ON THURSDAY. I AM ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT GOVERNOR STRICKLAND MENTIONED. COULD YOU THINK YOU CAN BE THE BEST PRESIDENT? BE READY TO LEAD ON DAY ONE. IT IS TESTED AND READY TO BE THE WINNING CANDIDATES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IF YOU ASK YOURSELVES THOSE QUESTIONS, HE WILL GO AND STAND AND COMPASS FOR ME. HE WILL NOT BE CAUGHT A THING FOR ME, YOU WILL BE DOING IT FOR YOURSELF AND FOR THE COUNTRY. AND FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. WE DO NOT WANT TO BE THE FIRST GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY WORSE OFF. YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING IT FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT BE THERE ON THURSDAY NIGHT. SOME OF THE PEOPLE FROM IOWA ARE IN THE MILITARY OR IN THE RESERVES OR THEY MAY BE PATROLLING IN BAGHDAD ARE STANDING GUARD DUTY IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF THAT WILL RESPECT THEM AND WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BODY ARMOR THAT THEY NEED. HE NEEDS TO GIVE THEM EVERY RESOURCE THAT IS REQUIRED TO DO THE JOB THAT IS ASKED OF THEM AND WHO WILL BRING THEM HOME FROM IRAQ GIVE THEM MISSIONS THAT ARE IN KEEPING WITH OUR VALUES AND INTEREST. YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING IT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AT NIGHT. I HAVE MET SO MANY OF THEM. MANY NURSES HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT. WE ALSO HELP TO DO MORE FOR THE NURSES THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO. I HAVE MET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS AND THEY CANNOT BE THERE EITHER. THEY DESPERATELY THE A PRESIDENT TO HELP WITH THEIR WAGES AND THEIR HEALTH CARE AND THEIR FUTURE. HE WILL BE DOING THIS FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY -- HE WILL ALSO BE DOING THIS FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO NEVER GET TO MEET ANY OF THE CANDIDATES. HE MIGHT BE DOING THIS FOR SOME WOMAN IN PARKINSON'S. YOU MIGHT NEED TO DO IT FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO HAVE A STEM CELL RESEARCH BILL SIGNED. [APPLAUSE] HE MIGHT BE DOING IT FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS SICK AT HEART ABOUT ALL OF THIS. IT IS NOT JUST MY ASKING YOU TO GO AND COMPASS FOR ME, I AM ASKING YOU TO CAUCUS FOR THE FUTURE. -- COMPASS FOR ME. BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE NEED TO MAKE THE CHANGES WE DESPERATELY NEED. I WILL STAND AND FIGHT TO THIS CAMPAIGN. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN AFTER ME FOR 16 YEARS AND MUCH TO THEIR DISMAY, I AM STILL HERE. [APPLAUSE] [ APPLAUSE ] >> I PROMISE YOU THIS, I WILL NOT FORGET THE FACES THAT I HAVE SEEN, THE STORIES THAT I HAVE HEARD AS I HAVE CRISSCROSSED IOWA NOW FOR NEARLY A YEAR. THEY WILL ALL COME WITH ME INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. AND YOU WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT AGAIN WHO GUESS UP EVERY DAY, WORRYING ABOUT HOW WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. HOW WE PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST AGAIN. HOW WE SET BIG GOALS. AND THEN WE ACHIEVE THEM. AND TOGETHER WE WILL RESTORE PRIDE IN OUR NATION. PROGRESS WE CAN BELIEVE IN. AND MAKE HISTORY THAT WE ONCE AGAIN CAN SHOW OUR CHILDREN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

I THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR COMING OUT AND STANDING UP FOR A DEMOCRAT. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT NOW IS THAT AS WE GO ON WITH THIS CONTEST, WE KEEP FOCUSED ON THE TWO BIG ISSUES. THAT WE ANSWERED CORRECTLY THE QUESTIONS THAT THESE TWO BUS HAS POSED. HOW WILL WE WIN IN NOVEMBER 2008 BY NOMINATING A CANDIDATE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO GO THE DISTANCE AND WHO WILL BE ABLE TO BE THE BEST PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE? I'M READY FOR THE CONTEST. [APPLAUSE] NOW, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALWAYS PLANNED TO RUN A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE EARLY CONTESTS. I WANT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA, PARTICULARLY DEMOCRATS, AND LIKE-MINDED INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT. [APPLAUSE] TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE STAKES ARE HUGE.

BECAUSE IF WE DO NOT BEGIN TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK, AND RAISE THE FAMILIES, AND MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT, WE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE AMERICA IN A FEW YEARS. [APPLAUSE] AND I WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR I INTEND TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE INHERITED BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AND THEN GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND WE ARE GOING TO REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW, BY THE FEW, AND FOR THE FEW BUT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR EVERY AMERICAN AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR CHILDREN. I HAVE DONE THIS WORK FOR 35 YEARS. IT IS THE WORK OF MY LIFETIME. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION AND THE PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO HAVE HEALTH CARE AND THAT IS TRANSFORMING ITS WORK. THAT IS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED IN OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. I AM SO READY FOR THE REST OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I AM SO READY TO LEAD. [APPLAUSE] SO, IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN HAVE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN, THEN I AM YOUR CANDIDATE. AND IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WILL BREAK THE SHACKLES OF OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND SET FORTH A SET OF GOALS FOR US TO MEET TOGETHER, THEN I AM YOUR CANDIDATE.

THIS COUNTRY DESERVES EVERYTHING WE CAN GIVE TO IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO CAUCUS DESPITE THE LARGE TURNOUT. THERE WERE A LOT OF IOWANS WHO ARE IN THE MILITARY. THEY ARE IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN SERVING A COUNTRY AND THEY NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO RESPECT THEM AND WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT FORCE SHOULD BE ONLY USED AS A LAST RESORT, NOT A FIRST RESORT. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK AT NIGHT. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THEIR FEET. PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS IN A HOSPITAL OR WAITING ON A TABLE IN A RESTAURANT OR IN A PATROL CAR, KEEPING OUR STREETS SAFE. THEY NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS GOING TO CARE ABOUT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. I RODE A BOOK SOME YEARS AGO AND IN IT I HAVE A CHAPTER IT THAT NIGHT TITLED ""EVERY CHILD NEEDS A CHAMPION.""

THIS LASTS ABOUT 10 MINUTES. >> YOU KNOW, I WAS NOT SURE THAT I WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO LOVE A STATE AS MUCH AS I LOVE MY HOME STATE OF ARKANSAS. BUT TONIGHT, I LOVE IOWA A WHOLE LOT. [APPLAUSE] OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS MY FAMILY AND I HAVE HAD A MARVELOUS AND JOY AND PRIVILEGE OF GETTING TO KNOW MANY OF YOU, AND IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE HONOR. I WAS THINKING LAST NIGHT, OF SOME OF THE FRENCH SHIPS WITH A FORGED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. -- FRIENDSHIPS WE OF PORTUGAL AND SEVERAL MONTHS WILL BE OF FRENCH SHIPS THAT LAST A LIFETIME. I KNEW ONE THING. I WOULD BE FOREVER GRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE THAT I MET, THE ONES WHO VOTED FOR ME, EVEN THE ONES WHO DID NOT, WE STILL TREATED ME WITH RESPECT AND GAVE ME THEIR ATTENTION, ALLOWED ME TO COME OFTEN, NOT JUST TO THEIR COMMUNITIES, BUT INTO THEIR HOMES, NOT ONCE, BUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. A FEW OF THEM MIGHT EVEN CONVINCE TO VOTE FOR ME TONIGHT. AND THAT IS REALLY REMARKABLE. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE MY WIFE JANET. SHE WAS A WONDERFUL FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS. [APPLAUSE] AND I THINK SHE WILL BE A WONDERFUL FIRST LADY FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] WE ALSO WANT TO SAY THANKS TO OUR THREE CHILDREN THAT ARE WITH US TONIGHT. I WOULD LIKE THEM TO COME AND JUST BE A PART OF THIS TONIGHT. THEY HAVE ALL BEEN IS SO MUCH INVOLVED. OUR OLDEST SON JOHN, OUR SON DAVID, HIS WIFE, OUR DAUGHTER SARAH, WHO HAS LITERALLY LIVED IN IOWA FOR THE PAST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS. I TOLD HER IF SHE STAYED MUCH LONGER, SHE WOULD HAVE TO GET AN IOWA DRIVER'S LICENSE AND PROBABLY PAY MORE TAXES APPEAR. [LAUGHTER] I SAY THANKS TO ALL OF THEM FOR JOINING AN EFFORT, BECAUSE THE FAMILY GOES THROUGH, NOT JUST THE CANDIDATE. TONIGHT IS A CELEBRATION FOR EVERYBODY ON OUR TEAM, SO MANY OF YOU WHO TRAVELED FROM ALL ACROSS AMERICA TO BE HERE. I AM AMAZED. I AM ENCOURAGED. TONIGHT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A NEW DAY IN AMERICAN POLITICS. A NEW DAY IS NEEDED IN AMERICAN POLITICS, JUST LIKE ANY DAY IS NEEDED IN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. TONIGHT IT STARTS HERE IN IO BUT IT DOES NOT END HERE TO READ IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE OTHER STATES, AND ENDS AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE ONE YEAR FROM NOW. [APPLAUSE] I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED THREE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THROUGH THIS VICTORY TONIGHT. THE FIRST THING IS THAT PEOPLE REALLY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN AT THE PURSE. AND WHAT A GREAT -- WHAT A GREAT LESSON FOR AMERICA TO LEARN. [APPLAUSE] MOST OF THE PUNDITS BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU ARE A OUTSPENT AT LEAST 15 AT TO WHAT IT IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME THAT MOUNTAIN OF MONEY, AND SOMEHOW GARNER THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT THAT IS NECESSARY TO WIN AN ELECTION. WELL TONIGHT WE PROVED THAT AMERICAN POLITICS STILL IS IN THE HANDS OF ORDINARY FOLKS LIKE YOU AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT ABOUT TO RAISE THE MOST MONEY, BUT WHO RAISED THE GREATEST HOPES AND DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR FUTURE, AND TONIGHT, I HOPE WE WILL FOREVER CHANGE THE WAY AMERICANS LOOK AT THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEM AND HOW WE ELECT PRESIDENTS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS. [APPLAUSE] TONIGHT THE PEOPLE OF IOWA MADE A CHOICE AND THEIR CHOICE WAS CLEAR. THE CHOICE WAS FOR A CHANGE, BUT THAT CHOICE FOR A CHANGE DOES NOT AND JUST SAYING WHAT -- IS SAYING THAT HAS CHANGED THINGS. CHANGE CAN BE FOR THE BETTER FOR THE WORSE. AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR A CHANGE, BUT WHAT THEY WANT IS A CHANGE THAT STARTS WITH A CHALLENGE TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE GIVEN THE SACRED TRUST OF OFFICE SO THAT WE RECOGNIZE WHAT OUR CHALLENGE IS, IS TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER, TO MAKE AMERICANS ONCE AGAIN MORE PROUD TO BE AMERICANS THAN JUST THE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, TO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT GOING UP INSTEAD OF JUST GOING TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT. WHILE WE HAVE A DEEP CONVICTION THAT WE WILL STAND BY AND NOT WAVER ON, OR COMPROMISE, THOSE CONVICTIONS ARE WHAT BROUGHT US TO THIS ROOM TONIGHT, BUT WE CARRY THOSE CONVICTIONS NOT SO THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW PUSHED BACK THE OTHERS, BUT SO WE CAN BRING ALONG THE OTHERS AND BRING THIS COUNTRY TO THE GREATEST DAYS EVER, BECAUSE I AM STILL ONE WHO BELIEVES THAT THE GREATEST GENERATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE ONES BEHIND US, BUT THE ONES WHO HAVE YET TO BE BORN, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE. [APPLAUSE] AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE LEARNED SOMETHING ELSE TONIGHT, AND THAT IS THAT THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT WE. I DO NOT SAY THAT LIGHTLY. I AM THE PERSON WHOSE NAME GETS ON THE SIGNS. AND OCCASIONALLY GETS THE ATTENTION IN SOME OF THE FEW ADVERTISEMENTS THAT CAME OUT HERE AND THERE. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT ME. THE COUNTRY IS NOT JUST ABOUT ME. WHAT IS HAPPENING TONIGHT IN IOWA IS GOING TO START REALLY A PRAIRIE FIRE OF NEW HOPE AND HIS ZEAL AND IT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE NATION. IT IS ABOUT WHEAT, WE THE PEOPLE. WE SAW IT TONIGHT. WE HAVE SEEN IT IN OTHER STATES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE IT BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY URINES AND IS HUNGRY FOR LEADERSHIP THAT RECOGNIZES THAT ONE -- THIS COUNTRY URINE'S AND IS HUNGRY FOR IT LEADERSHIP THAT RECOGNIZES -- THIS COUNTRY IS UNDER FOR LEADERSHIP THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THE LEADER IS PART OF THE SERVING A CLASS. G. K. CHESTERTON ONCE SAID THAT THE TRUE SOLDIER FIGHTS NOT BECAUSE HE HATES THOSE WHO ARE IN FRONT OF HIM, BUT BECAUSE HE LOVES THOSE WHO ARE BEHIND HIM. I RECOGNIZE THAT RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS NOT HITTING THOSE WHO ARE IN FRONT OF US, IT IS -- HATING THOSE WHO ARE IN FRONT OF US, BUT LOVING THOSE WHO ARE BEHIND US. [APPLAUSE] IT IS ABOUT RECOGNIZING -- IT IS RECOGNIZING THAT BEHIND US OUR GREAT PATRIOTS DATING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY 156 BRAVE MEN PUT THEIR SIGNATURES ON A DOCUMENT THAT STARTED FORTH THE GREATEST EXPERIMENT IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND, AND GAVE BIRTH TO THE IDEA THAT ALL OF US ARE CREATED EQUAL AND WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY OUR CREATOR INALIENABLE RIGHTS, LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, AND THESE WHO SIGNED THAT DOCUMENT, WHO GAVE BIRTH TO THE STREAM, WERE THE BEGINNINGS OF A THOSE WHO THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY HAVE CONTINUED THROUGH GREAT SACRIFICE AN EXTRAORDINARY DOLLAR TO PASS ON TO US THAT LIBERTY, THE QUEST FOR SOMETHING BETTER THAN THE GENERATION BEFORE THEM HAD. I STAND HERE TONIGHT, THE RESULT OF PARENTS WHO MADE INCREDIBLE SUCH DEVICES AS PART OF A GREAT GENERATION, WHO WENT THROUGH A DEPRESSION AND WORLD WAR AND SAID THAT OUR KIDS WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE THINGS. OF THE SACRIFICES THEY MADE WAS TO THE US ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND GIVE US A BETTER AMERICA THAT THEY COULD ENVISION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BUT THE SAME REASON OUR FOUNDING FATHERS AND -- FOR THE SAME REASON OUR FOUNDING FATHERS AND THOSE BEFORE US SAW WAS BEHIND US AND GAVE IT THEIR BEST, I ASK YOU TO JOIN ACROSS IOWA AND THE REST OF AMERICA TO LOOK OUT IN FRONT OF US AND NOT HATE THOSE, BUT TO LOOK AT THOSE -- BUT TO LOOK BEHIND US AND LOVE THEM SO MUCH THAT WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE AMERICA A BETTER COUNTRY, TO GIVE OUR KIDS A BETTER FUTURE, TO GIVE THIS WORLD A BETTER LEADER, AND WE JOIN TOGETHER TONIGHT FOR THAT PURPOSE. GOD HELP YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE IT. I AM SO GRATEFUL OF THE SUPPORT, THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE IT, AND NOW WE HAVE A LONG JOURNEY AHEAD OF US. I WISH IT WERE ALL OVER TONIGHT AND WE COULD JUST CELEBRATE THE WHOLE THING. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IF THIS WERE A MARATHON, WE HAVE ONLY ONE HALF OF IT. BUT WE HAVE RUN IT WELL. IT IS ON TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THEN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COME TO THIS PLACE AND SAY, WHERE EVERY DANCE, AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT IS GOING TO BE -- WHERE EVERY ENDS AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT IS GOING TO BE -- [LAUGHTER] IT STARTED HERE IN IOWA.

TO BE A GREAT PRESIDENT AND SHE WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT SHE IS RUNNING TO DO. I WILL BRING HER ON WITH THIS. PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE FROM ALL OVER AMERICA. PEOPLE FROM ARKANSAS WHERE SHE HAS NOT LIVED IN 15 YEARS. THEY WROTE THEIR OWN BROCHURE. PEOPLE, FARMERS CAME FROM NEW YORK TO CONVINCE IOWA FARMERS THAT THERE WERE FORMS IN NEW YORK AND SHE HAD HELPED THEM. ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE WORKED THEIR HEARTS OUT. ALL THESE PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] AND IT HAS BEEN BEAUTIFUL TO ME TO SEE. BUT HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU ABOUT HER. I NOTICED SOMEONE THE OTHER DAY HAVE CRITICALLY EVEN, SAID THAT HILLARY WAS AFFLICTED WITH A RESPONSIBILITY GENE. I THOUGHT AFTER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THAT IS A GOOD THING. WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND I WANT TO BRING HER ON WITH THIS ONE THING. IT WOULD BE A GREAT THING IF WE HAD THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. [APPLAUSE] AS I THINK ABOUT MY WORKING GRANDMOTHER WHO RAISED ME UNTIL I WAS FOR, MY WORKING MOTHER WHO STRUGGLED AND WAS SOMETIMES DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF HER GENDER, OUR DAUGHTER WE RAISED TO BELIEVE SHE COULD DO WHAT SHE WANTED, MY MOTHER-IN- LAW AND THE STRUGGLE SHE HAD TO RAISE HER DAUGHTER AND HER FAMILY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS SHE WOULD BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT MATTERS. I BRING HER ON WITH THIS. ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE WILL FIGURE THIS OUT. YOU WILL ASK EVEN IF YOU LIVE TO BE 100 AND I HOPE YOU WILL DO. IF YOU LIVE TO BE 100, YOU STILL HAVE MORE YESTERDAY'S THAN TOMORROW. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WHAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF WHEN YOU QUIT THEN WHEN YOU STARTED IN BUT THERE ARE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HAVE A BETTER FUTURE. IF THAT IS YOUR TEST, THIS IS YOUR CANDIDATE. A GREAT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE LAST EVENT. THE LAST EVENT IN A WONDERFUL, LONG CAMPAIGN. IT STARTED OUT WITH LEVEL OF INTENSITY THAT I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. AND HAS ONLY GOTTEN MORE SO. BECAUSE AMERICA NEEDS TO PICK A PRESIDENT WHO WILL MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE. AND AS I HAVE TRAVELLED ACROSS IOWA FOR THESE LAST 11 MONTHS, I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH. BY LISTENING TO ALL OF YOU. I CAME TONIGHT IN LARGE MEASURE TO SAY THANK YOU. IN HAS BEEN WONDERFUL HAVING MY FAMILY -- IT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL HAVING MY FAMILY WITH ME. WE WERE ALL REMINDED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT OF OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND TO HAVE MY MOTHER AND MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGE AND MY FRIENDS AND MY SUPPORTERS, BUT MOSTLY I AM HERE TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU. IN THIS GATHERING AND ACROSS THIS STATE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE INVITED ME INTO THEIR HOMES AND THEIR HEARTS. THEY HAVE SHARED WITH ME THEIR DEEPEST CONCERNS AND HOPES AND FEARS, AND TOGETHER WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE WANT FOR CHILDREN AND WHAT KIND OF FUTURE AMERICA DESERVES TO HAVE. THE PROCESS OF PICKING A PRESIDENT STARTS HERE IN IOWA TOMORROW NIGHT. WE WILL KNOW BY TOMORROW NIGHT WHAT IOWANS HAVE DECIDED. I HOPE THAT AS YOU GO INTO THE CAUCASUS, YOU WILL BE THINKING ABOUT -- THE CAUCAUSES, YOU'LL BE THINKING ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION OF LAW. WHO WILL BE THE PRESIDENT TO MEET THE CHALLENGES AND SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT AWAIT US AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW, ON JANUARY 20, 2009, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE SWORN IN ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITAL. AND WAITING FOR THE PRESIDENT ON THE DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE WILL BE ALL THE PROBLEMS WE KNOW ABOUT. A WAR TO END IN IRAQ, A WAR TO RESOLVE IN AFGHANISTAN, AN ECONOMY TO REVIVE IN THE FACE OF $100 A BARREL OIL, FALLING HOUSING VALUES, RISING HEALTH- CARE COSTS, MORE UNINSURED AMERICANS, AND SO MUCH ELSE. AND AS BILL SAID, THERE ARE ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT WILL END UP ON THE DESK OF OUR PRESIDENT THAT NONE OF US CAN PREDICT OR FORESEE RIGHT NOW. YOUR DECISION EVERY FOUR YEARS IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO BUT IT IS THE BEST -- ESPECIALLY CRITICAL THIS YEAR. NOT ONLY IS WATCHING, OUR ENTIRE WORLD IS HOLDING ITS BREATH WAITING FOR PRESIDENT THAT WILL ONCE AGAIN WORK WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD, BUILD OUR ALLIANCES AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND EVERYBODY IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS TALKING ABOUT CHANGE. WE ALL WANT CHANGE. SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU BRING ABOUT CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT AND SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU BRING IT ABOUT BY HOPING FOR ITS. I BELIEVE YOU BRING ABOUT CHANGE BY WORKING HARD FOR IT. BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. SETTING THOSE GOALS. ADOPTING THE PLANS. AND THEN EXECUTING THEM. NOW, I HAVE BEEN MAKING A POSITIVE CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO BE AN AMERICAN. I WAS GIVING BLESSINGS I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CREATING. I WAS GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES THAT I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. I BELIEVE TO WHOM MUCH IS GIVEN, MUCH AS EXPECTED. THEREFORE, TOGETHER, WE CAN GET BACK TO MAKING THE KIND OF CHANGES THAT WILL GIVE OUR FELLOW AMERICANS THE CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR OWN LIVES AGAIN. IT WILL PUT US ON A PATH TO DEAL WITH THE MYRIAD OF PROBLEMS WE FACE. FROM THE WORK I DID AS A YOUNG LAWYER FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, HELPING TO CHANGE LAWS SO THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION, TO REFORMING THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND EXPANDING HEALTH CARE IN ARKANSAS, TO WORKING THOSE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON EVERYTHING FROM THE ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE SYSTEM, TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD REPRESENTING OUR COUNTRY, TOO -- TO TACKLING THE TOUGH PROBLEM OF HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. SOMETIMES YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT A PERSON WHEN THEY DO NOT SUCCEED THAN WHEN THEY DO. I AM PROUD THAT BILL AND I TRIED TO GIVE AMERICA QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, WE WILL GET IT DONE. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD A COUNTRY THAT HAS A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS. WHERE UNIONS ARE PART OF THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA THAT WILL GIVE INDIVIDUALS A BETTER SHOT AT A LIFE OF WORK AND DIGNITY WITH RISING WAGES. WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE THE ECONOMY AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE WANT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY BACK AGAIN. SOMETHING THAT WE LOST OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THAT WILL FUEL JOB CREATION AND WILL WORK TOGETHER ACROSS PARTY LINES THE WAY I HAVE IN THE SENATE. WHEN I GOT TO THE SENATE, PEOPLE SAID SHE WILL NEVER WORK WITH REPUBLICANS AND REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER WORK WITH HER. THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT KNOW HER -- ME OR WHAT I THINK ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE I THINK HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE IS A PUBLIC TRUST. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET UP EVERY DAY AND NOT THINK ABOUT HOW TO GRATIFY YOUR OWN EGO BUT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT HALF. TO MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER. [APPLAUSE] SO HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE. THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN THAT I HAVE PROPOSED WILL OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH PLAN SO THAT EVERY AMERICAN WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE CHOICES THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE HEALTH CARE FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. WE ARE GOING TO USE OUR INGENUITY, ARE A SENSE OF INNOVATION, TO REVOLUTIONIZE ENERGY IN AMERICA. THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE HELD HOSTAGE TO $100 A BARREL OIL. AND WHY WE CANNOT RULE OUR SLEEVES AND BECOME MORE ENERGY- EFFICIENT AND CREATE THE JOBS THAT THE FUTURE AND I HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN. . I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. SINCE WHEN DID AMERICA BECOME THE NATION OF CAN'T DO. WE ARE THE NATION THAT BROUGHT A MAN BACK FROM THE MOON. WE CAN DEAL WITH GLOBAL WARMING AND WE CAN MAKE MILLIONS OF JOBS IN THE PROCESS. [APPLAUSE] THE CAN HAVE A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION STARTING WITH PREKINDERGARTEN FOR ALL OF OUR FOR YOUR FOUR-YEAR OLDS. WE CAN MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN. WE CAN REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT AND END OF THE NO-BID CONTRACTS. WE CAN ACTUALLY APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE POSITIONS THAT WE ASK THEM TO HOLD. WE CAN END THE CRONYISM. YES, WE CAN HAVE A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY. IT STARTS BY ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRING IN OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE CAN. I HAVE SAID THAT AS SOON AS I AM INAUGURATED I WILL ASK FROMASK FOR A PLAN FROM THE JOINT CHIEFS AND THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS PLANNED. GENERAL CLARK WILL TELL YOU THIS. WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME WITHIN 60 DAYS AND TO TELL THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT THE BLANK CHECK THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD GIVEN THEM IS NO LONGER VALID. THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ONLY THEY CAN MAKE FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE. AND WHEN WE BRING THE TROOPS HOME THE STATE CARE OF THEM. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN GET THE HEALTH CARE AND THE COMPENSATION AND OTHER SERVICES THAT THEY DESERVE. -- WHEN WE BRING OUR TROOPS HOME, LET'S TAKE CARE OF THEM. THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE IN AMERICA AND ARE RUN ON THE WORLD BUT I AM CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC THAT WE ARE UP TO THE TASK. -- AROUND THE WORLD. I AM ASKING YOU TO CAUCUS FOR ME TOMORROW. I AM ASKING YOU TO GO AND STAND FOR ME FOR A NIGHT SAID THAT I CAN STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR YOU THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN UNTIL WE WIN IN NOVEMBER OF 2000 AND 8 -- 2008 -- 2008. TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE HISTORY. LET'S DO IT, IOWA, LET'S DO IT TOGETHER. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

I REACH MY HAND ACROSS THE AISLE FOR THE DEMOCRATS. I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. I JUST LEFT MY FAVORITE DEMOCRAT IN JOE LIEBERMAN. HE'S MY FAVORITE. I GIVE THEM ALL THE CREDIT. WE HAVE TO START WORKING FOR AMERICA. I BELIEVE THAT WE FACE A CHALLENGE ISLAMIC EXTREMISM. IT IS A CHALLENGE EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD INCLUDING IN THE U.S.. WE ARE FIGHTING IN TWO WARS. GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS SAYS THAT IRAQ IS THE CENTRAL BATTLEGROUND IN THE ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND I BELIEVE THAT. I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE MANY MANIFESTATIONS. MOST OF US WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT SOME DOCTORS IN SCOTLAND OR SOME DOCTORS WOULD BECOME ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AND DESTROY THE AIRPORT. NONE OF US WHO BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE ALLOWING OSAMA BIN LADEN TO GETTING OUT A MESSAGE THAT RECRUITS AND INSTRUCTS AND MOTIVATES RADICAL ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS. I WILL GET OSAMA BIN LADEN EVEN IF HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE GATES OF HELL. I WILL GET HIM. [APPLAUSE] AMERICANS ARE VERY FRUSTRATED OVER THE WAR IN IRAQ. WE'VE SACRIFICED A GREAT DEAL. I AM THE ONLY REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT SAID THAT THE RUMSFELD STRATEGY IS DOOMED TO FAILURE. I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE. WE HAVE TO USE THIS NEW STRATEGY. BRITAIN THATTHAT STRATEGY WE ARE FACING IS BEST EXEMPLIFIED BY THAT IF WE HAD HAD THIS CONVERSATION A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE WOULD NOT HAVE MENTIONED PAKISTAN. TODAY, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WE HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTIES IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS NUCLEAR-WEAPONS AND HAS THE THREAT OF RADICAL ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AND IS ON THE BORDER OF AFGHANISTAN WHERE WE HAVE 40,000 BRAVE AMERICAN SOLDIERS SACRIFICING. I KNOW PAKISTAN AND ISRAEL AND I KNOW THIS COUNTRIES AND I KNOW THE LEADERS AND I'D BEEN INVOLVED INTIMATELY IN EVERY MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE WE FACED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. I NEED NO ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. I KNOW THAT THE STRATEGY IS SUCCEEDING. SOME OF MY OPPONENT DID NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS SUCCEEDING OR NOT. I WAS JUST OVER THERE HAVING THINGS TO BEGIN WITH BRIEF AMERICANS WERE SERVING THIS COUNTRY AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD A BETTER GROUP OF AMERICAN SERVING THIS COUNTRY THAN THOSE YOUNG AMERICANS WHO ARE SERVING TODAY. [APPLAUSE] AMERICA IS DIVIDED OVER THIS WAR. OF COURSE THEY'RE FRUSTRATED. OF COURSE THERE WERE SAD. AMERICANS ARE DIVIDED OVER THIS WAR BUT NONE OF US ARE DIVIDED ON OUR SUPPORT OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING OUR COUNTRY TODAY IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. . [APPLAUSE] AND NUMBER OF MONTHS AGO, WE'VE DECLARED DEAD. THE FACT IS THAT IN NUMBER OF MONTHS AGO WHEN I SAID THIS WAS THE PETRAEUS STRATEGY, THIS IS THE WAY AS TO WORK. THERE WERE MANY EXPERTS SEE SAID THAT JOHN MCCAIN'S POLITICAL CAREER IS OVER. I ACCEPTED THAT. I SAID I WOULD MUCH RATHER LOSE THE CAMPAIGN AND WAS A WAR. EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE, YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT PUTS EVERYTHING IN PROPER PARTY AND IN THE PROPER PLACE IN ONE'S LIFE. THIS ONE HAPPENED TO ME LAST AUGUST. I WAS A TANAT A TOWN HALL MEETING. A WOMAN STOOD UP AND SAID, I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. THAT FAVOR IS THAT I WISH YOU WOULD DO THE HONOR OF WEARING A BRACE IT WITH MY SON'S NAME ON IT. HE WAS 22 YEARS OLD. HE WAS KILLED IN COMBAT ASIDE BAGHDAD JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR. I SAID I WOULD BE HONORED TO WHERE THIS BRACELET WITH HIS NAME ON IT. THEN SHE SAID, I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME ONE THING -- I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT HE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT MY SON'S DEATH WAS NOT IN VAIN. WELL, I WILL DO THAT FOR HIS MOTHER AND EVERY OTHER FAMILY MEMBER THAT I CAN. I WILL LOVE AND CHERISH THE SEVEN AMERICANS AND I WILL KEEP THEM OUT OF HARM'S WAY. I WILL ONLY SEND THEM INTO HARM'S WAY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY. -- I WILL LOVE AV CHERISH THESE YOUNG AMERICANS. WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER AND THEY WILL.

IN JUST A FEW DAYS, IT WILL BE IN THE HANDS OF US, THE VOTERS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, TO MAKE THIS IMPORTANT DECISION. WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL THE CANDIDATES AND WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR. THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. IT IS HILLARY CLINTON FOR OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HILLARY CLINTON WILL DO AS OUR PRESIDENT, LOOK AT WHAT SHE HAS DONE. SHE HAS WORKED HARD FOR CHANGE HER ENTIRE LIFE. IT IS WHY SHE WENT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE 35 YEARS AGO AS A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE KNOW SHE WILL CONTINUE WORKING IN THAT WAY AND MUCH MORE HER FIRST DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEREAFTER. WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE. OTHER FIRST DAY, HILLARY CLINTON WILL GET THE WORK DONE -- ON HER FIRST DAY, AND LOCAL WILL GET THE WORK DONE. [APPLAUSE] -- HILLARY CLINTON WILL GET THE WORK DONE. SHE WILL STAND WITH US EVERY DAY SHE IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE IS GOING TO WORK HER HEART OUT TO BRING BIG CHANGES WE DESPERATELY NEED. IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR, THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE SENATOR WHO REPRESENTS ALL OF YOU, I WANT TO THANK MY DAUGHTER, CHELSEA, FOR BEING HERE WITH ME. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IN YET. THERE ARE CHARGES -- THERE ARE CHAIRS HERE. PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY FILL THOSE SHARES. WE COULD FILL SOME OF THESE CHAIRS. WE HAVE SOME PLACES IN THE BLEACHE2S. CAN WE LET SOME MORE PEOPLE IN? THERE BE -- THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE HALLWAYS. I APOLOGIZE WE ARE LATE, WE ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN. WE HAVE CHAIRS HERE AND OVER HERE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. WE WANT AS MANY VOTERS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO ON TUESDAY. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS REALLY ABOUT PICKING A PRESIDENT. THIS IS ABOUT ALL OF YOU FROM ONE END OF NEW HAMPSHIRE TO THE OTHER, LOOKING AT THE FACTS. IF EVERYBODY HAS A CHAIR NEARBY COULD RAISE THEIR HANDS, THE FIRE MARSHAL NEED TO SEE WHERE THE CHARGES ARE SO WE CAN GET PEOPLE IN. MR. FIRE MARSHAL, WE HAVE BLEACHER SEATS, AS WELL. WE ARE TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY IN. I THINK THAT AS WE GO TOWARD TUESDAY, IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY LOOK AT WHAT IT IS WE ARE GOING TO BE FACING AS A COUNTRY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE MAKING THIS DECISION? WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DO YOU NEED TO ASK AND HAVE ANSWERED IN ORDER TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS? I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS, WHO IS READY TO BE PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE? THE SUBSIDIARY QUESTION TO THAT IS, WHO IS READY TO RUN AND WIN REPRESENTING THE DEMOCRATS? THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ON THE MINDS OF THE VOTERS THAT I SEE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THERE CERTAINLY THE ONES THAT I THINK WILL GIVE US THE BEST NOMINEE AND THE BEST PRESIDENT. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT WE CAN TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I SEE LOOMING ON THE HORIZON AND THE NEED FOR AN ECONOMIC ACTION PLAN. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT I WILL TRY TO DO ON THE VERY FIRST DAY. SOME PROBLEMS, WE REALLY CANNOT WAIT TO ADDRESS. YESTERDAY, WE HAD SOME ON FAVORABLE ECONOMIC NEWS -- UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC NEWS. WE SAW THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE GOING UP AND SAW THE WORST THREE DAYS IN THE STOCK MARKET SINCE 1932. WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION NOW TO TRY TO AVOID, IF WE CAN, SLIDING INTO RECESSION. I THINK WE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DO WHAT I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING FOR MONTHS. WE SHOULD TAKE ACTION TO TRY TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON HOME FORECLOSURES. WE ARE DIZZY BIG INCREASE IN FORECLOSURES HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE NEED TO DO MORE TO GET THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AND WALL STREET'S TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HELPED TO CREATE. WE NEED TO GIVE MORE SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FACING HOME FORECLOSURES. ALL OF THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD BEGIN DOING THAT NOW. WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE MORE HELP FOR FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR HEATING BILLS, SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE A BIG DEAL HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MY STATE OF NEW YORK. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GET READY RIGHT NOW TO REPLENISH THE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION FUNDS SO THAT PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS ARE GOING TO BE IMMEDIATELY GIVEN HELP. WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT HOW WE CAN GET MORE TAX RELIEF TO MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. WE SHOULD BE REVERSING NOW THE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS AND GET THAT MONEY FLOWING INTO THE POCKETS AND THE BANK ACCOUNTS AND THE HOMES OF MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS. I THINK WE NEED AN ECONOMIC ACTION PLAN. I AM NOT GOING TO LET GEORGE BUSH USE WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR ANOTHER PRETEXT TO CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. I'M AFRAID THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO TRY TO DO AGAIN, YOU KNOW? HE TRIES TO KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN. I DO NOT LIVE NOW BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY. IT IS NOT BEEN FOR OUR COUNTRY. THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO FACE A LOT OF PROBLEMS ON A THURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 2009. WE HAVE A WAR TO END IN IRAQ, AND WERE TO RESULT IN AFGHANISTAN, 47 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS, AN ECONOMY THAT IS FALTERING, AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE ECONOMISTS WILL SAY, BUT I THINK IT IS SLIPPING INTO RECESSION. WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION NOW. WE HAVE AN ENERGY CRISIS WITH HUNDRED DOLLARS PER BARREL OIL THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WE FACE. WE HAVE GOT TO BE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO REPAIRING THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE. I HAVE PROPOSED COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO DEAL WITH HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE, AND ENERGY AGENDA THAT WILL BE ENERGY-EFFICIENT, CREATE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY, GET US OF OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL, WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THAT KIND OF BACKWARDS ECONOMIC APPROACH. THERE IS A MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. I HAVE LAID OUT ALL OF THESE PLANS IN THE CAMPAIGN. I WANT TO ASK PEOPLE TO RAISE AND ONE MORE TIME SO THE FIRE MARSHAL CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE SOME MORE PLACES FOR MORE PEOPLE TO COME IN. YES. EVERYBODY, COME IN. I WANT TO GET AS MANY OF YOU IN. IS NO FUN BEING STUCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR. YOU HAVE COME TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO GET UP THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM AND COMMITMENT AND THE CONCERN ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. REVOCABLE OVER HERE. ONE BACK THERE. -- WE HAVE A COUPLE OVER HERE. ONE BACK THERE. >> YEAH, HILLARY. [APPLAUSE] >> EXCELLENT. WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE COMING IN. WE WERE REALLY TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY IN NEW HAD COME OUT. I IMAGE PROBLEM SOLVER. I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THAT THROUGH THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS ASK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW OR ANY ISSUE YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THAT WILL HELP YOU MAKE UP YOUR MINDS. I WILL GET EVERYBODY IN AND THEN WE WILL GET TO THE QUESTIONS. I AM FILLING TIME. [LAUGHTER] THE WRITERS ARE ON STRIKE. DAVID LETTERMAN WENT BACK TO WORK. I DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MATERIAL, BUT I CAN FILL A FEW MINUTES. I LOVE NEW HAMPSHIRE. I LOVE COMING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, I LOVE THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TAKE THIS ELECTION. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE PICKING A PRESIDENT. THIS IS JUST OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME OUT AND BE PART OF THIS PROCESS. WE WANT TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE DOOR. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE SOME MORE SEATS OVER HERE, AS WELL, THIS WAY. LEAVE THAT DOWN. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN SIT ON THE FLOOR, TOO, IF WE NEED TO. OK. COME RIGHT IN HERE. CHELSEA, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT UP SO PEOPLE CAN SIT DOWN? HEAR, HEAR, DEAR. -- HERE, HERE, DEAR. COME RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] SIT RIGHT THERE. OK. WE WILL FILL UP ALL THE WAY BACK THERE. THAT OK. THAT IS HOW I FEEL SOMETIMES, TOO. YOU SEE, WE DID HAVE QUITE A CHALLENGE THIS MORNING, BUT WE ARE MEETING IT. YOU KNOW? BIG CHALLENGES, REAL SOLUTIONS, RIGHT? OK. IF PEOPLE WANT TO SIT DOWN HERE, WE HAVE A FEW MORE TEARS OVER HERE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR WAY AROUND THE BACKDROP. FILL UP THIS SPACE. WHAT DOES THAT SAY? THAT IS GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OK. [APPLAUSE] MY GOODNESS, ALL RIGHT. WE WILL START WITH THE QUESTIONS. I WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE A CHANCE. WE HAVE A HUGE CROWD AND MORE PEOPLE COMING IN. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I WANT TO TAKE AS MANY QUESTIONS AS I CAN. I WILL STAY AS LONG AS I CAN. I WILL TRY TO GET TO EVERYBODY. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS TO ALL OF US. I WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST TO THE CANDIDATES, THAT YOU KNOW WHERE WE STAND, YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE, YOU KNOW WHAT WE WILL DO. THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW. THAT IS REALLY WHAT WE ARE ALL ENGAGED IN. IT IS AN ELECTION THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. WE DO NOT HAVE ONE MINUTE TO WASTE. WE HAVE NO MARGIN FOR ERROR. WE HAVE A LOT OF SERIOUS DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. THIS YOUNG LADY RIGHT THERE. >> BILL O'REILLY JUST ASKED ME -- >> BILL O'REILLY. HOW ARE YOU? YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM POINTS FOR COURAGE. GO AHEAD. >> HE ASKED ME WHAT YOUR PLAN IS FOR REMOVING TROOPS FROM IRAQ. I THOUGHT SINCE YOU WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT BETTER THAN I CAN. >> THANK YOU. THIS QUESTION IS FOR YOU AND FOR BILL O'REILLY. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS MY PLAN FOR REMOVING TROOPS FROM IRAQ. I HAVE SAID THAT ON THE FIRST DAY I AM INAUGURATED PRESIDENT, I WILL ASK THE JOINT CHIEFS, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND MY SECURITY ADVISERS TO GIVE ME A PLAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT I CAN BEGIN WITHDRAWING TROOPS WITHIN 60 DAYS. THE REASON I AM ASKING FOR A PLAN -- [APPLAUSE] -- IS BECAUSE LAST SPRING, I WAS TOLD BY MY MILITARY ADVISERS, WHO CONSIST OF RETIRED MILITARY OFFICERS AND SOME OF THE ACTIVE- DUTY OFFICERS THAT I AM IN TOUCH WITH, THERE WAS NOT PLANNING GOING ON IN THE PENTAGON. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID NOT WANT TO PLAN BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT PART OF THEIR GAME PLAN. I WROTE TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND SAID, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT PLANNING IS GOING ON FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF OUR TROOPS. I GOT A LETTER BACK THAT SAID, WE WILL NOT TELL YOU. I SAID, YES, YOU ARE. WE HAD A HEARING. IT WAS A CLOSED DOOR HEARING. WHAT I CAN SAY TO YOU IS, WE GOT VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. I WILL TELL THE MILITARY PLANNERS AND OUR SECURITY PLANNERS IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN WORK TO PLAN. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. YOU ARE HEARING A LOT IN THIS CAMPAIGN. PEOPLE JUMP UP AND SAY, GETTING THEM OUT TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IS INVOLVED. I THINK YOU NEED TO REALIZE THAT WITHDRAWING TROOPS IS DANGEROUS. YOU DO NOT JUST WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND SAY, LOAD EVERYBODY UP, TAKE THEM OUT. YOU HAVE TO GUARD THE EXIT ROUTES, WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO OF TROOPS THAT ARE BASICALLY PROTECTING THE CONVOYS. YOU NEED TO TAKE UP THE EQUIPMENT. YOU CANNOT LEAVE THAT. WE DO NOT WANT IT TO FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS. YOU HAVE TO PLAN FOR WHAT WE WILL DO WITH OR CIVILIANS. WE HAVE OVER 100,000 AMERICANS A DOESN'T WORK FOR THE EMBASSY, BUSINESSES, NON-PROFIT AGENCIES THAT ARE THERE. I HAVE INJECTED INTO THIS DEBATE ABOUT WITHDRAWAL SOMETHING I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE IRAQIS WHO HELPED US. A LOT OF IRAQIS PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. [APPLAUSE] THEY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO SERVE AS TRANSLATORS, DRIVERS. I WENT TO FALLUJA AND SHORTLY AFTER THE MARINES TO THE BACK, IT WAS A VERY BLOODY BATTLE. I KNOW A YOUNG MARINE CAPTAIN WHO TOLD ME THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE HE AND HIS MEN WILL HAVE SURVIVED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR IRAQI TRANSLATOR. HE SAID, EVERYBODY KNOWS HE WAS A MARINE TRANSLATOR, AND HE AND HIS FAMILY ARE TARGETED. WE NEED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE LIKE THAT. I THINK I CAN BEGIN WITHDRAWING OUR TROOPS WITHIN 60 DAYS. I SEE NO REASON THAT I CANNOT. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE THAT BASED ON MY ASSESSMENT OF THE MILITARY SITUATION. I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO SAY, EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE CAN TAKE SAFELY OUT ONE-TWO BRIGADES PER MONTH. WE HAVE TO SEND A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT THE BLANK CHECK THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS NO LONGER VALID. THEY HAVE TO BEGIN FINALLY TAKING THOSE DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING, WHICH ARE ONLY THERE IS TO MAKE. WE HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY EMBARK ON INTENSIVE DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN TRY TO STABILIZE IRAQ AS WE WITHDRAW. PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME, WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE SITUATION REALLY DETERIORATES? I THINK THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION. I DO NOT BELIEVE, BASED ON A LOT OF CAREFUL STUDY OF THIS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF IRAQI GOVERNMENT ACTION, IT MATTERS WHETHER WE STAY A WEEK, A MONTH, A YEAR, OR 10 YEARS. IN FACT, I BELIEVE THAT OUR BEGINNING TO WITHDRAW WILL FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF THE IRAQIS UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN SAY OR DO. IT IS ONLY THEN THAT THERE WILL BEGIN TO DO WHAT THEY MUST DO TO THE DRUG OUT A CIGARETTE WITH THE MILITIA, THE ALLOCATION OF OIL -- TO DO WHAT THEY MUST DO TO DEAL WITH THE MILITIA, THE ALLOCATION OF OIL. [APPLAUSE] YES, MA'AM. >> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT [INAUDIBLE] I HAVE BEEN SICK CONSTANTLY, COUGHING, NOT ABLE TO STOP. INHALERS, PILLS, AND MEDICAL PEOPLE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING. THE CHURCH PAID MY MEDICAL BILLS SO I COULD GET HELP. I HAD TO GO FROM ONE PLACE TO PENACOOK. I JUST SAID TO GET AWAY FROM THE CIGARETTE SMOKE. -- I JUST HAD TO GET AWAY FROM THE CIGARETTE SMOKE. >> SHE HAS BRONCHIAL CHRONIC PROBLEMS. EVERY TIME SHE IS A RADICAL WAS SMOKE, THEY GET WORSE, AND TO CANNOT DEAL WITH IT IF SHE IS EXPOSED TO SECONDHAND SMOKE. THANKFULLY, OUR COUNTRY IS NOW CRACKING DOWN ON SECONDHAND SMOKE. I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SEE A LOT OF CHANGES AS MORE AND MORE STATES AND CITIES BAN SMOKING IN INDOOR AREAS, BANS SMOKING IS IN COMMON AREAS. IT IS A BIG PROBLEM. WE KNOW THE DIRECT SMOKING -- WE KNOW THE DIRECT PROBLEMS SMOKING IS FOR PEOPLE. SECOND-HAND SMOKE IS A TERRIBLE THING. SOME OF US REMEMBER WHEN YOU USE TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE ON PLANES. THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT SPECIFICALLY IS MORE LIKELY TO BE ADDRESSED ON LOCAL LEVEL AND THE STATE LEVEL. SHE ALSO RAISED HEALTH CARE. WE WILL GET SOME HELP YOUR QUESTIONS SO I CAN TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN GENERAL. UP THERE? IS IT ON HEALTH CARE? YES. >> [INAUDIBLE] THE BEST POLICY, THE BEST HEALTH CARE. I MOVED TO THIS COUNTRY [INAUDIBLE] PEOPLE WERE DYING IN BED WITH NO MONEY. THEY NEVER KNEW WHY THEY DIED. [INAUDIBLE] TO SEE MY FAMILY. THEY HAD FREE HEALTH CARE. THIS COUNTRY THAT THE LOVE VERY MUCH IS SUPPOSEDLY THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE ONES WHO HAVE INSURANCE [INAUDIBLE] THEY CANNOT PAY THE HEALTH INSURANCE. >> RIGHT, RIGHT. I WILL ANSWER YOU ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY. YES? >> THEY PASSED THE STATE LAW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I AM A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE. >> RIGHT. >> THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. >> WE ARE GOING TO FIX THAT. HIS DAUGHTER IS IN COLLEGE, STILL ON HIS HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY. WENT TO GRADUATE, THAT ENDS. IT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. ONE MORE QUESTION ON HEALTH CARE AND I WILL TALK A LOT ABOUT HEALTH CARE. STEM CELL RESEARCH, OK. YOUR HAND WAS WAVING. >> I HAVEN'T ELDERLY MOTHER AND YOUNG CHILDREN. >> I HAVE AN ELDERLY MOTHER AND YOUNG CHILDREN. >> I GOT YOU. I BELIEVE THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME FOR AMERICA TO JOIN TOGETHER TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE, QUALITY HEALTH INSURANCE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. I HAVE BEEN PASSIONATELY COMMITTED TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR MANY YEARS. I TRIED IT BACK IN '93 AND '94 AND WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL THAT TIME. I AM PROUD WE TRIED. IT IS A MORAL AND ECONOMIC IMPERATIVES. IF YOU HAVE SEEN AS MANY PEOPLE AS I HAVE SEEN OR SICK, WHO HAVE LITERALLY DIED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE, IT MAKES YOU SICK. HERE WE ARE HER, A WONDERFUL COUNTRY, THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, AND WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT HEALTH CARE. SHAME ON US. HERE IS WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED AND I WILL DO. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE PROPOSED THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN. IS THERE A SIMPLE. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU LIKE AND YOU ARE HAPPY, NOTHING CHANGES. I WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE LESSONS I LEARNED IN '93 AND '94. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE DID NOT WANT ANY CHANGES. THAT IS FINE. THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE IN AMERICA. WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE WOULD DO NOT HAVE CHOICES MORE CHOICES. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UNINSURED HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE? YOU. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, MAYBE YOU YOURSELF, DO HAS HEALTH INSURANCE, WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE TO PAY FOR WHAT AILS YOU, THEY WILL NOT DO IT OR THEY WILL NOT PAY EVERYTHING. WE HAVE BIG PROBLEMS. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT A 47 MILLION UNINSURED. WE HAVE GOT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH HEALTH INSURANCE THAT DOES NOT DELIVER. UNDER MY PLAN, WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH PLAN. CONGRESS HAS A REALLY GOOD PLAN FOR ITSELF. WHAT WE DO NOT HAVE IS A PLAN THAT IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY AMERICAN AS GOOD AS THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN. CONGRESS HAS OVER 250 OPTIONS IN ITS PLAN. ON AVERAGE, IT COSTS LESS THAN WHAT YOU CAN BUY IN THE PRIVATE MARKETPLACE OR WHAT YOU CAN GET FOR YOUR EMPLOYER. ONE OF THE REASONS IT COST LESS IS BECAUSE YOU, THE TAXPAYERS, PAY 75% OF THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE. IT IS GOOD INSURANCE. IT IS COMPREHENSIVE. COVERS MENTAL-HEALTH, SOMETHING THAT EVERY SINGLE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN IN AMERICA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO. MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD NOT BE STIGMATIZED AND PUSHED OUT OF COVERAGE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO OPEN THIS UP. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE. IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD WHAT YOU NEED OR WANT, WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS. WE ARE GOING TO LIMIT TO A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME WHAT YOU WILL EVER HAVE TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS. IF YOU LOSE A JOB OR CHANGE JOBS, YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE. IF YOU TAKE TIME OUT OF THE WORKPLACE TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY OR TAKE CARE OF THEIR RELATIVE, A MOTHER, FATHER, A GRANDPARENT, YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TOTALLY AFFORDABLE, QUALITY, ALWAYS AVAILABLE HEALTH INSURANCE. I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. IT IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL REASONS I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I UNDERSTAND THAT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A POLITICAL COALITION OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE TIRED OF PAYING THE BILLS AND CANNOT CONTROL THE COSTS, UNIONS THAT ARE FACING THE SAME KINDS OF PRESSURES, THEY NEGOTIATE MORE OR HEALTH INSURANCE THAN THEY DO OVER WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS, OF DOCTORS WHO ARE TIRED OF WORKING FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES INSTEAD OF THEIR PATIENTS, OF NURSES WHO FEEL INCREASINGLY SQUEEZED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MORE AND MORE PATIENCE AND PUT UNDER MORE AND MORE PRESSURE IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMANDS, IN ORDER TO KEEP COSTS DOWN, WE SPEND MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD, AND WE STILL DENY GET WHAT WE SHOULD. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM WITH THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. WE NEED TO A BETTER CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT. WE NEED TO PAY FOR PREVENTION. THERE IS SOME OF WE CAN DO TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS NOT A GOVERNMENT- RUN MEDICINE. IT IS NOT A NEW BUREAUCRACY. WE WILL TAKE WHAT ALREADY WORKS FOR CONGRESS AND EXPAND IT TO EVERYBODY. I FIGURE IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONGRESS, IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT SHOULD BE OUR GOAL WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE. [APPLAUSE] THE GENTLEMAN HERE TALKING ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, I JOINED FORCES WITH A FAMILY HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THEIR 20-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MICHELLE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH COLON CANCER. SHE WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY. SHE WAS STILL ON HER PARENTS' POLICY. THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID, SHE IS ONLY ON THIS POLICY BECAUSE SHE IS A FULL-TIME STUDENT. IF SHE DROPS OUT OF SCHOOL TO COPE WITH HER CANCER, SHE WILL LOSE HER HEALTH INSURANCE. IT DEFIES ANY KIND OF SENSE OF DECENCY. HERE IS THIS CHILD, COPING WITH ADVANCED COLON CANCER, SO RARE IN A YOUNG WOMAN, AND HAVING TO CONTINUE TO BE A FULL-TIME STUDENT TO GET A HEALTH INSURANCE. AFTER SHE DIED, HER MOTHER MADE IT HER MISSION TO PASS THE BILL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT SAID THAT THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY. YOU CAN MAINTAIN YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE WHEN YOU GET SIX AS A STUDENT AND CONCENTRATE ON TRYING TO GET WELL. THEN, SHE CAME TO WASHINGTON AND I HEARD ABOUT THIS. I AM NOW SPONSORING A BILL TO MAKE THIS THE LAW ACROSS THE LAND. [APPLAUSE] NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE PASS COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM, AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE MOST ADVANTAGE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE JOBS THAT OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE, WHO MAY NO LONGER BE ON THEIR FAMILIES POLICIES, BUT WHO WILL BE INSURED UNDER THE PLAN THAT I AM PROPOSING FOR A REALLY LOW PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO GET EVERYBODY COVERED IN AMERICA. THIS CAMPAIGN. ONE OF MY LEADING OPPONENTS PROPOSED A PLAN THAT DOES NOT COVER EVERYBODY. I THINK THAT IS A REALLY BIG MISTAKE. IT IS A MISTAKE ON THE MERITS FOR A DEMOCRAT TO PROPOSE A PLAN THAT DOES NOT COVER EVERYBODY, AND IT IS A MISTAKE POLITICALLY. ITS SEEDS TO THE REPUBLICANS THE ARGUMENT THAT WE CAN DO THIS. -- IT CEDES TO THE REPUBLICAN THE ARGUMENT THAT WE CANNOT DO THIS. WE CAN DO THIS. WE NEED TO ENSURE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. OTHERWISE, WE'RE GOING TO START BY LEAVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT. MY QUESTION IS, WHO DO WE LEAVE OUT? DO WE LEAVE OUT THE YOUNG WOMAN HERE WHO HAS TERRIBLE BRONCHIAL CONDITIONS? THERE EXACERBATED BY EXPOSURE TO SMOKE. DO WE LEAVE OUT THE WOMAN I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW WHOSE SON WAS BORN WITH A CONGENITAL HEART CONDITION WHO HAS ALREADY HAD FOUR OPEN HEART SURGERY AND HAS MORE TO COME? SHOULD WE TRY TO LEAVE OUT HEALTHY PEOPLE? SINK, YOUR HELP THE, YOU DO NOT NEED HEALTH INSURANCE? WE ARE DEMOCRATS -- SAYING, YOU ARE HEALTHY, YOU DO NOT NEED HEALTH INSURANCE. WE ARE DEMOCRATS. REPUBLICANS ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS MORALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE FINALLY GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE. [APPLAUSE] LET ME ANSWER THE SANDWICH GENERATION. I RELATE TO THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR FAMILIES, YOU HAVE THREE GENERATIONS, FOUR GENERATIONS, EVEN FIVE GENERATIONS NOW, IT IS MORE LIKE A SUBMARINE SANDWICH. I FEEL SO STRONGLY THAT WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITIES IN AMERICAN FAMILIES LIVES TODAY. AMERICAN WORKERS ARE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE. THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO BALANCE FAMILY AND WORK. MOTHERS AND FATHERS, SINGLE MOMS, GRANDPARENTS ARE TRYING TO PITCH IN AND HELP OUT. I THINK WE NEED TO EXPAND THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. IT HAS BEEN A GODSEND FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THALASSA ASMAN I SAW WAS 50 MILLION AMERICANS AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THIS LAW THAT GIVES ON PAID LEAVE TO PEOPLE WHO WORK IN COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN 50 EMPLOYEES TO TAKE CARE OF A NEWBORN BABY, TAKE CARE OF YOUR MEDICAL PROBLEMS, TO TAKE CARE OF A MOM OR A DAD TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO BE THE BEST FAMILY MEMBER POSSIBLE. I THINK WE NEED TO EXPAND THAT. IT HAS NOT IN ANY WAY PROVEN TO BE A BURDEN ON THE ECONOMY. YOU ACTUALLY GET MORE PRODUCTIVE WORKERS BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEIR EMPLOYER CARES ABOUT THEM AS PEOPLE. THEY WILL STAY AS LOYAL. THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THERE. I THINK WE HAVE TO HELP FAMILIES SAVE FOR RETIREMENT. WE ARE AT A NET ZERO SAVINGS. I THINK WE HAVE DROPPED BELOW ZERO. PEOPLE ARE NOT SAVING. IT IS HARD TO SAVE WITH THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING GOING UP. I HAVE PROPOSED THE AMERICAN RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS WHERE YOUR FIRST THOUSAND DOLLARS OF SAVINGS, IF YOU MAKE UP TO $60,000, WOULD BE MATCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS AN INCENTIVE FOR YOU TO SAVE. I HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF HAVING PEOPLE WHO HAVE 401KS AND OTHER SAVINGS ACCOUNT TO BE IT -- TO BE AUTOMATICALLY PUT INTO THOSE ACCOUNTS AND LET THEM OPT OUT IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO IT. IF THEY ARE ASKED TO MAKE A DECISION TO GO IN, THEY NEVER GET AROUND TO IT. EVERYONE IS PUT IN, YOU'LL GET INTO THE SAVING MODE AND WE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD UP SOME RETIREMENT SAVINGS. I THINK OUR RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TAPPED FOR BIG LIFE EXPENSES. SOMETIMES, YOU ARE JUST ON THE BRINK. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THAT CAPACITY. I ALSO THING WE NEED TO HAVE MORE SUPPORT FOR FLEXIBLE WORK RULES, FOR TELECOMMUTING, FOR MORE CHILD CARE, TO HELP WORKING FAMILIES BE ABLE TO BE BOTH A GOOD WORKER AND A GOOD PARENT. WE WORKED VERY HARD. I WAS INSTRUMENTAL INVOLVED IN CREATING A LOT OF AFTER-SCHOOL CARE FOR PEOPLE. IT IS ALL BEING CUT BACK. THE MOST WORRISOME TIME IN THE DAY FOR A LOT OF WORKING FAMILIES IS BETWEEN THREE AND 6:00. WE NEED TO BE SAFE IN PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES. I AM COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, SOMETHING WE STILL DO NOT HAVE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE. THAT IS A FAMILY ISSUE. IF YOU ARE WORKING HARD AND NOT BRINGING HOME THE MONEY YOU SHOULD, AND WE HAVE A SUPREME COURT THAT JUST MADE IT A LOT HARDER BY SHUTTING DOWN SOME OF THE RELIEF THEY USED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE EQUAL PAY ACT, SO I WILL CHANGE THE LAW TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE BUSH SUPREME COURT CANNOT STAND IN THE WAY OF WOMEN WHO BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST GETTING WHAT THEY DESERVE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PAID ON AN EQUAL BASIS. [APPLAUSE] FINALLY, WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH LONG-TERM CARE. WE HAVE SO MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE FACING THIS NOW. ITS PARENT, A GRANDPARENT, MAYBE CHRONICALLY-ILL SPOUSE OR CHILD, ARE IN NEED OF LONG-TERM CARE. WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO HELP PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES RIGHT AT HOME. THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE WORKED ON. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A CARE GIVER, MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE CAREGIVERS, WOMEN BEAR MOST OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CAREGIVING FOR ALL THE GENERATIONS. WE TALK ABOUT IT. WE LIVE IT. IT IS WRONG THAT YOU CAN GET MORE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PUTTING SOMEONE IN A NURSING HOME THEN LEAVING THAT PERSON IN YOUR OWN HOME AND PROVIDING THE CARE BY HAVING SOMEBODY COMING IN TO HELP YOU. [APPLAUSE] I JOINED UP WITH REPUBLICANS. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF BIPARTISAN WORKS AS I HAVE BEEN IN THE SENATE, MUCH TO SOME PEOPLE'S SURPRISE. WE PASSED A RESPITE CARE BILL, THE < < ACT, TO BEGIN TO PROVIDE SOME HELP -- THE RESPITE CARE ACT, TO BEGIN TO PROVIDE SOME HELP TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRETCHED BY TAKING CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. IN THE COURSE OF DOING THAT, IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT ALL THE CARE GIVERS IN AMERICA WHO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE OUT OF LOVE AND DEVOTION WERE TO STOP TOMORROW, THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE TO FIND $300 BILLION OF PAID CARE. THAT WOULD FEED PEOPLE, DRESSED PEOPLE, WHAT OVER PEOPLE, AND I THINK WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF WE DID MORE THAN GIVE LIP SERVICE TO FAMILY VALUES AND STARTED IN VALUING FAMILIES. I HAVE A WHOLE APPROACH TO MAKING THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] RIGHT THERE. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> AND DENTAL. THANK YOU FOR RAISING IT. I CONSIDER DENTAL TO BE PART OF COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. WHEN I GOT OUT THE LAW SCHOOL, I DID NOT WANT TO WORK FOR A LAW FIRM. I WORKED FOR THE CHILDREN TO DEFENSE FUND. I WENT DOOR TO DOOR -- FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. I WENT DOOR TO DOOR TO FIND OUT WHY KIDS WERE NOT IN SCHOOL. I HELPED BUILD THE KIDS FOR PASSING THE SPECIAL EDUCATION LAW THAT REQUIRED ALL OF OUR CHILDREN BE GIVEN ACCESS TO EDUCATION. IT CHANGED THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF CHILDREN. I STAYED INVOLVED FOR MANY YEARS. I REALLY RELY ON THEIR GREAT WORK. THEY GIVE YOU GOOD INFORMATION. THEY MAKE IT COME ALIVE FOR PEOPLE. ONE OF THE STORIES THAT HAS JUST BROKEN MY HEART IS FOR A YOUNG BOY, 12 YEARS OLD, LIVING IN MARYLAND. HIS MOTHER HAD A LITTLE BIT OF INCOME AND SHE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, BUT NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH AN EMPLOYER WHO WOULD HELP HER. SHE COULD NOT PAY HERSELF. HER SON GOT A TOOTHACHE. SHE STARTED CALLING DENTISTS. A LOT OF THEM WERE VERY GOOD PEOPLE, THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT PAY. SHE TRIED TO GET ON THE CHILDREN HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM HELPED TO START 10 YEARS AGO. THE PAPERWORK WAS SLOWING IT DOWN. THE TWO THAT TURNED INTO AN ABSCESS. THE ABSCESS BURST. THE LITTLE BOY WENT TO JOHNS HOPKINS. THEY TRIED TO SAVE HIS LIFE. THEY ENDED UP SPENDING $300,000 AND THE MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO TO THE DENTIST. WE ALSO NOW KNOW THAT DENTAL HEALTH IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO YOUR HEART. IT IS RELATED TO OTHER INFECTIONS AND DISEASES THAT ARE PROPAGATED THROUGH POOR DENTAL HYGIENE. THIS IS NO LONGER A LUXURY, IF IT EVER WAS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH- CARE REFORM. I INTEND TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] >> GLOBAL WARMING IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERY SINGLE PERSON ACROSS THE WORLD. WHAT ARE THE TOP THREE THINGS THAT YOU WILL DO? WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME? >> GLOBAL WARMING AFFECTS EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET. EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT NOW, I THINK. ONE OF THE TOP THREE THINGS I WILL DO TO ADDRESS ITS -- WHAT ARE THE TOP THREE THINGS I WILL DO TO ADDRESS IT? I WILL START ADDRESSING A ON DAY ONE. IN MY INAUGURAL SPEECH, I WILL ADDRESS GLOBAL WARMING, OUR DEPENDENCE ON A CARBON-BASED ECONOMY, OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL, I WILL ISSUE A CALL LOVE ACTION TO TAKE ON OUR ENERGY CRISIS AND THE THREAT OF GLOBAL WARMING. -- I WILL ISSUE A CALL OF ACTION TO TAKE ON OUR ENERGY CRISIS AND THE THREAT OF GLOBAL WARMING. WE SHOULD DECIDE THAT WE ARE GOING TO AIM HIGH. THIS CAN BE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE APOLLO SHOT. EVERY SINGLE PERSON CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. IT IS NOT AS WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT DOES, IT IS WHAT WE ASK OF EACH OTHER. I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I WANT TO CONVENE THE LEADERS OF THE MAJOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMITING NATIONS, THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, THE U.S., MEXICO, BRAZIL, RUSSIA, CHINA, INDIA, SOUTH AFRICA, AND WE WILL MEET UNTIL WE GET A POST-KYOTO AGREEMENT. WE WILL NOT QUIT. I WANT TO GET IT DONE IN MY FIRST YEAR. I WILL BUILD ON WHENEVER WE CAN GET OUT OF THE BALI PROCESS. I WILL IMMEDIATELY SERVE NOTICE TO THE WORLD THAT MY ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IN SCIENCE. WE ARE ENDING THE WAR ON SCIENCE. WE WILL START LISTENING TO THE SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS WHO WILL GIVE US THE WAY FORWARD ON THIS. [APPLAUSE] I WILL PERSONALLY COMMIT TO MEET WITH THOSE LEADERS EVERY THREE MONTHS. I WANT AN AGREEMENT BY 2010. I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE ANY TIME TO WASTE. AS FAST AS WE CAN DO IT, THE BETTER OFF WE WILL BE. THE U.S. NEEDS TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO WORK WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. WHY DON'T WE ENGAGE IN A LOT OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS? WE NEED SOLAR ARRAYS IN THE DESERT. WE NEED MUCH MORE IN TERMS OF WIND ACROSS THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT ARE NOT POPULATED AND COULD BE HOOKED UP TO THE GRID. THERE IS SOME WHAT WE CAN DO. SECONDLY, I WILL IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE CONGRESS COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY GLOBAL WARMING LEGISLATION. WE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS THIS YEAR. WE RAISED GAS MILEAGE, WHICH WAS WAY OVERDUE. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE ARE FIVE BIG PIECES OF THIS, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, WE COULD GAIN SOME MUCH IF WE WERE ALL MORE CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH ENERGY WE USE THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO USE. WE COULD MAKE IT SO CLEAR. TURNING OFF LIGHTS, UNPLUGGING APPLIANCES, MOVING EVEN FASTER TOWARD THE DEADLINE WE HAVE SET FOR THE USE OF COMPACT FLUORESCENT BULBS, THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO IN OUR OWN LIVES. I WILL SAY ON MY FIRST DAY THAT WE WILL NOT BUILD OR RENOVATE ANY OTHER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS ON LESS THEY ARE CARBON NET NEUTRAL. WE WANT TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ACTUALLY BE A CONTRIBUTOR TO THE END OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE CAN LOOK AT THE 500,000 BUILDINGS IN THE FEDERAL PYRAMID INVENTORY AND EVERYONE OF THEM OF THEM -- AND EVERY ONE OF THEM COULD BE MORE EFFICIENT. WE CAN PUSH THE ENVELOPE WITH CARS BY TELLING THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS, WE WANT YOU TO STAY IN BUSINESS, WE WANT YOU IN THE RIGHT BUSINESS. WE WANT TO PRODUCING CARS THAT WILL GIVE US GREATER GAS MILEAGE AND REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND CUT OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DRAMATICALLY. AND A ONE DEMONSTRATION OF CAR THAT IS DRIVING AROUND WASHINGTON TREATED AS ONE OF THESE NEW, FANCY, BATTERIES, THE LITHIUM BATTERY, IT IS A PLUG-IN HYBRID, IT HAD 1,500 MILES ON 10 GALLONS OF GAS. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE WE CAN DO. THIS IS WHERE AMERICA IS AT ITS BEST. WE ARE THE INNOVATORS, THE INVENTORS, THE CREATORS, WE SHOULD BE THE ARCHITECTS OF THE FUTURE. ONE OF THE GREAT INDICTMENTS I HAVE OF GEORGE BUSH IS THAT HE HAS INJECTED A STRAIN OF FATALISM AND TO OUR COUNTRY'S BLOODSTREAM. WE CANNOT SOLVE THE ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING CRISIS. THAT WILL WRECK THE ECONOMY. IF WE DO NOT, WE ARE WRECKING OUR ECONOMY. $100 PER BARREL FOR OIL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO OUR ECONOMY? [APPLAUSE] I KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF YOU HERE. I SEE THE SIGN OVER THEIR. YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. EVERYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY DO TO PUT THE INCENTIVES WHERE WE NEED TO BE. I HAVE PROPOSED AN ENERGY FUND THAT WILL BE FUNDED BY TAKING THE TAX SUBSIDIES AWAY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT NEED OUR MONEY TO MAKE THESE ASTRONOMICAL PROFITS. WE WILL PUT THAT MONEY TO ALL OF THE OTHER POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED SOME FEDERAL PROGRAMS TO RETROFIT HOMES. WE NEED A WEATHER IS ASIAN PROGRAM -- WHETHERIZATION -- WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. WE NEED TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK SO THE BILLS ARE NOT SO HIGH IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] FINALLY, IF YOU ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT OUR SECURITY, BEING DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL, IF YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE DEVASTATION THAT IS PROJECTED FOR GLOBAL WARMING, BEFORE WHAT I AM PROPOSING BECAUSE IT IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY. WE WILL PUT 5 MILLION PEOPLE AT LEAST TO WORK. WE NEED A NEW JOB-CREATING SOURCE IN AMERICA. WE ARE NOT CREATING JOBS. WE HAVE HAD ONE OF THE LOWEST JOB CREATING RECORDS IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. WE NEED TO GET THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN. WHAT BETTER WAY THAN TO DEAL WITH GLOBAL WARMING? I'M EXCITED. WE WILL DO THIS AND WE WILL ASK EVERYBODY TO PLAY A ROLE IN IT. YES. [APPLAUSE] >> I AM TEACHING HERE AT A HIGH SCHOOL. >> A TEACHER HERE AT A HIGH SCHOOL. THANK YOU. >> I HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH THE DECEPTIVELY-NAMED NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU FOR TEACHING, FIRST. [APPLAUSE] I AM SO HONORED TO HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT AND SUPPORT OF THE TEACHERS HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THAT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE TO TELL YOU IF FUNNY STORY. I TOLD YOU I WOULD CHAIRED THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. WE RACK OUR BRAINS TO COME UP WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE BEST SLOGAN FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO, WE CAME UP WITH, LEAVE NO CHILD BEHIND. THAT WAS THE SLOGAN. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE IN 2000 WHEN I TURN ON THE TV AND HEAR PRESIDENT BUSH TALKING ABOUT, NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER HOW IN 2000 HE SAID HE WOULD BE A YOU NITER, NOT A DIVIDER, HE WOULD BRING AMERICA DID THE OTHER, -- A UNITER, IT WOULD BRING AMERICA TOGETHER, HE DID NOT NEED EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HE HAD GOOD INTUITION AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET WITH THE ROLE LEADERS AND HE WOULD LOOK INTO THEIR EYES AND THEIR SOUL AND SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS. REMEMBER THAT? I THOUGHT, O.K., MAYBE HE WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT LEAVING NO CHILDREN BEHIND. THE LEGISLATION THAT HE CHAMPIONED THAT IS DECEPTIVELY- NAMED, AS YOU SAY, HAS NEVER BEEN ADEQUATELY FUNDED, BREAKING THE PROMISE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH MADE TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, TO THE PUBLIC, TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. IT HAS NEVER BEEN EFFECTIVELY ADMINISTERED. IT HAS BECOME THIS BURDEN ON OUR SCHOOLS IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINES TEACHING AND LEARNING. IT IS DEMORALIZING. IT IS KIND OF MOVING TOWARD THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR INSTEAD OF UNLEASHING THE CREATIVE GENIUS AND THE LEARNING CAPACITY OF OUR KIDS. IT IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TESTING PROGRAM. THE TESTS ARE NOT ADEQUATE OR UP TO THE JOB. THE WAY THAT THEY DETERMINE WHETHER SCHOOLS ARE SUCCEEDING OR NOT IS, FRANKLY, TOTALLY DEMEANING. HERE IS THE KIND OF DECISION THAT THEY MAKE ABOUT A CLASS. SUPPOSE YOU HAVE 25 KIDS IN A CLASSROOM. FIVE ARE SPECIAL ED KIDS. THANK GOODNESS THEY ARE IN SCHOOL. THEY'RE PART OF WHAT I HELPED TO CHANGE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. FIVE ARE NOT EVEN ENGLISH- SPEAKING. 15 ARE OF VARYING APTITUDES AND PREPARATION. A TEST IS GIVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR UNDER NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. IT IS ON A SCALE OF 1-5. THE CHILDREN ON AVERAGE TEST THAT 2. AT THE END OF THE YEAR OF THE TEACHER'S EFFORTS AND THE HARD WORK, THE TEST IS GIVEN AND THE KIDS TEST THE4 -- TEST AT 4. THAT IS CONSIDERED FAILING BECAUSE IT DID NOT REACH 5. YOU ARE GETTING A WRONG IMPRESSION OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON IN LEARNING. THE OTHER THING YOU ARE DOING IS THAT KIDS WHO COULD GO WAY AHEAD QUICKLY ON THEIR OWN ARE BEING BASICALLY SUPPRESSED. THEY HAVE TO STAY IN LINE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABILITY. I WAS IN CHARGE OF HELPING TO REFORM THE SCHOOLS IN ARKANSAS MANY YEARS AGO. I AM PROUD THAT WHEN WE STARTED, PEOPLE SAID, THE SCHOOLS IN ARKANSAS WERE AMONG THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY AND WHEN WE FINISHED, THEY SAID WE DID MORE TO IMPROVE THE SCHOOLS. I BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABILITY. I TOOK TOUGH STANCE. I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY. -- TOUGH STANDS. I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY. STATES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOWER STANDARDS SO THEY LOOK GOOD. WE DO NOT GET AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING. WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARD INDIVIDUALIZED TEST-TAKING, INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT OF KIDS. CHILDREN ARE NOT JUST LITTLE TEST-TAKERS. AND THEY'RE NOT THE SAME. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES. WE SHOULD BE HELPING EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD DO BETTER OVER TIME. I AM PLEASED TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE EDUCATION COMMISSIONER. THAT IS WHAT THE COMMISSIONER HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS TRYING TO DO. I APPLAUD IT. I WILL WORK WITH THE EDUCATORS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO SEE IF WE CANNOT MAKE NEW HAMPSHIRE A DEMONSTRATION FOR HOW YOU DO IT RIGHT HELP TEACHERS TEACH AND STUDENTS LEARN. LET REAL ACHIEVEMENT TAKE PLACE. [APPLAUSE] >> MANY COUNTRIES HAVE HAD UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. MANY OF THEM HAVE FAILING SYSTEMS. THERE IS UNIVERSAL CARE, BUT YOU CANNOT GET TO IT FOR A LONG TIME. HOW DOES YOUR PLAN DIFFER AND DEAL WITH THAT? >> GREAT QUESTION. SOME COUNTRIES HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. THE COVER EVERYBODY. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE TIMELY CARE. YOU HAVE TO WAIT. HOW DO WE DEVISE A SYSTEM THAT AVOIDS THOSE KINDS OF PROBLEMS? THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A GOVERNMENT-RUN SYSTEM. THIS IS STILL GOING TO USE PRIVATE INSURANCE. FOR SOME PEOPLE, THAT IS CONTROVERSIAL. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, WE SHOULD HAVE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. I DO NOT THINK THAT IS WHAT WE WANT IN AMERICA. THIS SYSTEM IS CLOSER -- IT IS THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN. BASICALLY, YOU SIGN UP FOR WHAT YOU NEED IN HEALTH INSURANCE. IF YOU ARE A SINGLE 24-YEAR-OLD, YOU NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU ARE A 45-YEAR-OLD FATHER OF THREE. YOU SIGN UP FOR THE PLAN THAT BEST SUITS YOU. WE SET STANDARDS THAT EVERY HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY HAS TO MEET. YOU WILL NOT BE DENIED HEALTH COVERAGE BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, SOMETHING THAT HAS TO STOP. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE SO MUCH COST IN THE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET INTO A DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODEL. IT WILL STILL BE A PRIVATE- PUBLIC SYSTEM, THE WAY MEDICARE IS. MEDICARE IS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. ONE OF THE REASON IT IS LESS COSTLY THAN PRIVATE INSURANCE IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE GETTING COVERED. YOU GET THE COST DOWN AND YOU DO NOT HAVE A PROFIT FACTOR. IN THE SYSTEM-PROPOSING, IS STILL A PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES. YOU'LL HAVE NONPROFIT COMPANIES. WE WILL PROVIDE A MEDICARE-LIKE ALTERNATIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO PREFER THAT KIND OF SYSTEM. WE WILL BE VERY HEAVY ON CHOICES. THAT WILL ENSURE COMPETITION. THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEASURE WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT WORK SO WE DO NOT GET INTO -- I DO NOT WANT ONE-SIZE-FITS- ALL. DIFFERENT REGION OF -- REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY ARE DIFFERENT. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WORKS AND DISSEMINATE THAT. I THINK WE'RE PUTTING FORTH A PLAN THAT FIXES WHAT IS WRONG WITH AMERICA IN THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM, WITHOUT IMPOSING ANY KIND OF FOREIGN APPROACH. IT DOES WITH THE WORK IN AMERICA. WE ARE BIG GUN CHOICES. WE LOVE OUR TOURISTS. HAVING SAID THAT, -- WE ARE BIG ON CHOICES. WE LOVE OUR CHOICES. HAVING SAID THAT, THE OTHER COUNTRIES DO A BETTER JOB ON PREVENTION. THE LIFE SPAN IS EVEN MORE THAN OURS. WHAT THEY DO NOT DO SO WELL IS TO DEAL WITH WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE < EMERGENCY CARE. YOU NEED A KNEE REPLACED, YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS OR YEAR AND BE IN PAIN. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THEY DO BETTER THAN WE DO RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO IMPORT TO OUR SYSTEM. THAT IS WHY I CHOSE AS MY STARTING POINT THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN. WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCED IN RUNNING IT. WE CAN EXPAND IT OVER TIME UNTIL WE GET EVERYBODY IN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT HAVING TO CREATE A NEW BUREAUCRACY. WE LET THE SYSTEM OPERATES TO SEE WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT WORK. THE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS, WE NEED MORE INCENTIVES FOR DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS TO DELIVER EVIDENCE-BASED CARE. WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THAT, AND DARTMOUTH HITCHCOCK IS THE LEADER IN THIS. THEY HAVE DONE THE BEST RESEARCH ANYWHERE TO DETERMINE WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT WORK. THROUGH THIS PLAN, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO BE IN THIS PLAN, AND MOST OF THEM WILL, THEY ARE GOING TO BE ENCOURAGED AN REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT WORKS. A LOT OF WHAT THEY PAY FOR IS NOT COST-EFFECTIVE. I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE. IF YOU KNOW A DIABETIC, YOU KNOW THAT IT IS HARD TO GET A HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY THAT PAYS FOR REGULAR CHECKUPS AND YOUR FEET, YOUR EYE, THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE WHEN YOU ARE DIABETIC. A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE MADE A VERY CALCULATED DECISION. YOU MIGHT BE MY CUSTOMER THIS YEAR, BUT YOU MAY NOT BE MY CUSTOMER NEXT YEAR. WHY SHOULD I INVEST IN YOUR PREVENTIVE CARE? IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR FOOT AMPUTATED, I AM STUCK WITH THAT BILL IF YOU ARE MY CUSTOMER. IT IS A DOLLARS AND CENTS CALCULATION. AT EVERY BUT YOU DO PREVENTIVE CARE TO, AND TRY NOT TO DO IT, AND DEAL WITH THE EMERGENCIES AND TRY TO AVOID PAYING THE FULL COST IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. WE WILL TELL THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, NO MORE. IF THEY WANT TO BE IN THE BUSINESS, THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HEALTH. THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE PREVENTIVE CARE. I THINK THAT WILL HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, THAT WAY. [APPLAUSE] YES? >> I WOULD LOVE TO VOTE FOR YOU. I AM HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING PAST [INAUDIBLE] I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU SHOWED UP. IRAQ IS SUCH A MESS. >> GREAT QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS ABOUT THE VOTE IN THE SENATE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. IT WAS A NONBINDING RESOLUTION. IT URGED THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD BE DESIGNATED A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. WHY DID I VOTE FOR IT? I VOTED FOR IT BECAUSE THEY ARE A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. THEY SUPPORT AND PROMOTE AN FUND TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAS COST AMERICAN LIVES. THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY DONE SO IN IRAQ. THEY'RE THE PRIMARY IMPORTERS OF THE DEADLY PROJECTILE BOMBS THAT HAVE KILLED SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. THEY HAVE FUNDED ALL OF THE MILITIAS. THEY FUND HEZBOLLAH. THEY FUND HAMAS. WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE ENGAGED IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GIVE THEM THE CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO JUST STAND BY AND LET THEM CONTINUE UNABATED WITH NO EFFORT TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THEM. BECAUSE IT WAS A NON-BINDING RESOLUTION, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT WAS DONE, DESIGNATING THEM AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. MANY OF MY FELLOW SENATORS REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION I DID. . >> BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS A MISTAKE TO IGNORE BEHAVIOR THAT IS DIRECTLY CAUSING THE DEATHS OF AMERICANS. FOR ME, THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT IN ORDER TO TELL IT RUN THAT WE WANT DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM. WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT AND SAID THAT I THINK THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BEGIN A DIPLOMATIC PROCESS WITH IRAN, I WAS CRITICIZED BY PEOPLE. I SAID WE WOULD START AT THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL. WHEN YOU DO THEN, IT IS IMPORTANT TO BRING BOTH CARROTS AND STICKS TO THE TABLE. DESIGNATING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD, WHICH IS DEEPLY ENMESHED IN THE ECONOMY OF IRAN AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, MEANS THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL. THAT WAY, THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO GAIN BY TALKING TO US. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST WEEK'S FROM THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE, IS THAT IRAN RESPONSE TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE. IF YOU READ THE DECLASSIFIED VERSION OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE, IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT IRAN HAD CEASED ITS DIRECT PROGRAM TO PRODUCE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN 2003 BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE. AFTER WE PASS THE RESOLUTION YOU ARE REFERRING@ TO, OUR COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ SAID THAT THE IRANIANS WANT TO TALK TO US. WE HAVE SEEN A DECREASE IN THE INCOMING FLOW OF THESE WEAPONS. I DO NOT KNOW IF IT WAS A DIRECT CAUSE AND EFFECT, BUT IT HELPED CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THE IRANIANS HAD TO BEGIN MAKING THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS, WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO. I THINK THIS HAS BEEN REALLY POLITICIZED. PEOPLE HAVE SAID THINGS ABOUT IT THAT ARE NOT TRUE IN ANY WAY. BARACK OBAMA HAS CENTERED DURBAN. HE DID NOT VOTE FOR IRAQ, HE VOTED WITH ME IN IRAN. WHEN PEOPLE STARTED CRITICIZING HIM, HE ASKED IF BUSH DESIGNATED HIM A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING PHONE CALLS THAT SAY THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE ABOUT THIS. I REALLY REGRET THAT. LET'S HAVE AN ELECTION ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES. THOSE ARE DIFFICULT ENOUGH. LET'S NOT POLITICIZE AND FANTASIZE AND MAKE UP AND EXAGGERATE. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME. YES, BEHIND YOU. I CALLED ON YOUTUBE. -- I CALL ON YOU, TOO. [INAUDIBLE] >> HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN NOW? >> [INAUDIBLE] AND YOU ARE STILL PAYING OFF COLLEGE LOANS? >> ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SURE THEY CAN SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE. THIS MOTHER IT SAID TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW THERE WERE BORN TO DO IT, BUT HER DAUGHTER DESERVES TO GO TO COLLEGE. IT HAD TO SELL THEIR HOME, SHE WAS GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE. THAT IS WRONG, AND THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN AMERICA. I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. HERE IS HOW. WE WANT TO GIVE EVERYBODY A $3,500 TAX CREDIT TO HELP DEFRAY THE COST OF COLLEGE. I WANT TO INCREASE THE CO GRANTS. WE MADE SOME PROGRESS DOING THAT. WE WANT TO GIVE MORE KIDS A CHANCE TO EARN MONEY THROUGH NATIONAL SERVICE TO GO TO COLLEGE. TWO YEARS OF NATIONAL SERVICE, EARNING $10,000, ALLOWS SOMEONE TO GET OFF WITHOUT INCURRING DEBT. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, FORCING DOWN THE INTEREST RATES THAT THE STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN REQUIRING. BUT I HAVE MET@ STUDENTS HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT ARE STILL IN COLLEGE, DURING THIS ECONOMY WITH THESE REALLY LOW INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN PAYING 9% OR 10% ON THEIR STUDENT LOANS. THEY GOT HOOKED IN BY A STUDENT LOAN COMPANY. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE IS SUBSIDIZING FOR-PROFIT STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES THAT CATER EXECUTIVES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND GIVES THEM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STOCK OPTIONS. I THINK THAT IS WRONG. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL, MY FAMILY COULD NOT HELP ME. I WORK AND GOT A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP AND I BORROWED MONEY AT 2% INTEREST. WE HAD SOMETHING CALLED THE NATIONAL DEFENSE FUND ACT. IT WAS AN INVESTMENT IN ALL OF US. I WANT TO GIVE BACK TO THAT. I THINK IT IS AN INVESTMENT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] FINALLY, I AM GOING TO PUT AN END TO THOSE FINANCIAL AID FORMS THAT YOU ARE ASKED TO FILL OUT THAT ARE INCREDIBLY LONG AND COMPLICATED AND TAKE HOURS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION FOR, AND AT THE END, THEY SAY YOU DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY THING. THAT IS A CRUEL JOKE. EVERYBODY IS GOING TO QUALIFY FOR SOMETHING. ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE, YOU ARE KNOWN TO THE WILL TO DO IT AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AGAIN. >> SOMEBODY ALLUDED TO STEM CELL RESEARCH. I SAW COMMERCIAL YOU HAD THE CITY WERE FOR THAT. [INAUDIBLE] IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT IT WOULD SOLVE A LOT OF ISSUES. I HAVE PARKINSON'S. [INAUDIBLE] WHEN I HEARD THAT SPOT, YOU HAVE MY VOTE. I JUST WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. >> ABSOLUTELY, 100%. I BELIEVE -- [APPLAUSE] THIS YEN IN IS 30 YEARS OLD AND HAS PARKINSON'S. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER I WILL SUPPORT STEM CELL RESEARCH, AND THE ANSWER IS YES. ABSOLUTELY, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO. I WILL ASK THE CONGRESS, IMMEDIATELY, TO SEND ME TO PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE PASSED IN THE CONGRESS BY A HUGE MAJORITY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS VETOED. ONE IS A STEM CELL RESEARCH SO THAT I CAN SIGN IT IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE WARNED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP YOU. -- WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP YOU. [APPLAUSE] LET ME JUST SAY ONE OTHER THING. THE STEM CELL RESEARCH AND GLOBAL WARMING CONNECT TO ME IN THIS WAY. THE BUSH AND ADMINISTRATION HAS WAGED A WAR ON SCIENCE. THEY HAVE SUPPRESSED SCIENTISTS. THEY HAVE TAKEN IN PERMISSION OF WEB SITES. AND THEY HAVE TRIED TO UNDERMINE THE KIND OF SCIENTIFIC PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN SO BENEFICIAL TO US IN AMERICA. IT HAS NOT JUST SAVE LIVES, IT HAS IMPROVED OUR STANDARD OF LIVING. I AM GOING TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IN MY ADMINISTRATION THERE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED ANY INTERFERENCE WITH SCIENCE. LET THE SCIENTISTS TELL US WHAT THE FACTS ARE AND THEN WE WILL DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM, AND THAT INCLUDES STEM CELL RESEARCH. [APPLAUSE] YES? >> YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND NATIONAL SECURITY, BUT YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR MAKES UP 8% OF THE ECONOMY. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THAT? >> WHAT WOULD I DO TO EXTEND THE WORK OF THE NONPROFIT SECTOR IN AMERICA? THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR INCLUDES SO MANY OF THE ADVOCACY GROUPS AND THE SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, FAITH BASED, THE WHOLE NONPROFIT SECTOR NOT ONLY DELIVERS ESSENTIAL SERVICES, IT IS A HUGE EMPLOYER. I THINK THE MEMBER IS CLOSE TO 10% OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR -- I THINK THE NUMBER IS CLOSE TO 10% OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THEM. I SPEND SO MUCH OF MY LIFE IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR, AND IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT HIGH, AS PRESIDENT, DO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN TO EXPAND -- THAT I, AS PRESIDENT T, DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO EXPAND THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR. I THINK OF OUR SOCIETY AS A THREE LEGGED STOOL. ONE STOOL IS OUR DYNAMIC PRIVATE MARKET AND WE ARE BLESSED BECAUSE IT UNLEASHES THE INGENUITY OF AMERICANS, AND THERE IS NOT ANY OTHER LIKE IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT CONTINUES TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AND WE NEED BETTER ECONOMIC STEWARDSHIP BY OUR PRESIDENT. IT IS I WILL PROVIDE THAT, I HOPE, WHEN HE FINALLY LEAVES. THE ENTIRE WORLD IS WANTED WREATH A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEAVES. -- OF THE ENTIRE WORLD IS GOING TO BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEAVES. [APPLAUSE] OUR GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. WE NEED TO IN THE CORRUPTION AND INCOMPETENCE. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD OPERATE FOR EVERYBODY. THEY HAVE OPERATED LIKE IT IS GOVERNMENT FOR THE FEW BY THE FEW. WE NEED TO PRODUCE QUALITY RESULTS. THE THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL IS THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT. IT IS CIVIL SOCIETY, OUR FAMILIES, OUR ASSOCIATIONS, OUR ORGANIZATIONS. IT IS WHAT HAS ALWAYS MIDAMERICA UNIT. -- IT IS WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE AMERICA UNIQUE. I WANT TO DO MORE TO ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO COMPETE FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVELY DELIVERED THROUGH A NONPROFIT MODEL. I WANT TO DO MORE TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT NONPROFITS DO. WE HAD A CONFERENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE BEFORE WE LEFT. I WANT TO DO THAT EVERY YEAR AT THE WHITE HOUSE. SO, I AM OPEN TO ALL KINDS OF IDEAS TO MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE THIS THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL, WHICH MAKES LIFE MEANINGFUL, TUESDAY A VITAL AND PRODUCE WHAT WE NEED IN OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] YES? >> HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE WHO CHALLENGE IT YOUR POSITION THAT A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO ABORTION. >> HOW DO I RESPOND TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ULTRACONSERVATIVES WHO CHALLENGED MY POSITION THAT A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO ABORTION. THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE. IT HAS MANY DIMENSIONS. I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT EACH ONE OF US STRUGGLE WITH IN OUR OWN CONSCIENCE AND OUR OWN FAMILIES AND OUR OWN VIEWS OF THE WORLD AND OUR SENSE OF FATE. I BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS BROODED -- RIGID OOTED BELIEF THAT IS BASED ON OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] I ALSO BELIEVE THAT CHOICE IS REFLECTIVE OF AMERICAN VALUES BECAUSE IT IS HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE WHAT OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE LIKE IF THE GOVERNMENT WAS IN CHARGE OF INTERFERING WITH, SECOND GUESSING, CRIMINALIZING INTIMATE, PERSONAL CHOICES I HAVE WORKED TO MAKE ABORTION SAFE, LEGAL, AND RARE. I HAVE WORKED TO LOWER THE RATE OF TEENAGE PREGNANCY. I HAVE WORKED TO EXPAND FAMILY PLANNING. I HAVE TAKEN ON THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A MUCH HEAVIER EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION. I BELIEVE THAT. I THINK THAT THE MORE WE CAN HELP PEOPLE OF ALL AGES UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY ASSUME WHEN THEY BECOME SEXUALLY ACTIVE. THE MORE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION, THE BETTER OFF WE WILL ALL BE. I THINK IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN IMAGINE HOW YOU WOULD ENFORCE SOME KIND OF CRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION. I WILL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES. IN 1995, I WENT TO BEIJING TO SPEAK BEFORE THE CONFERENCE OF WOMEN. I GIVE A SPEECH THAT WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. IN YET, BY PUBLICLY CONDEMN THEM FOR THEIR PRO-ABORTION POLICIES. THEY HAVE BEEN FORCEFULLY STERILIZING WOMEN AND FORCEFULLY OF BOARDING AND WOMEN TO CARRY OUT THEIR ONE-FAMILY ONE CHILD POLICY. IT IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG FOR A GOVERNMENT TO BE MAKING THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS FOR ANY WOMAN AND HER FAMILY. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD, IN ROMANIA, THEY HAD A 5 CHILDREN PER WOMAN POLICY WHICH MEANT THAT THEY'VE ROUNDED UP WOMEN THEM TO WATCH THEM SO THAT DAYTHEY WOULD HAVE MORE CHILDREN. HUNDREDS OF CHILD LOOKED THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ENDED UP IN ORPHANAGES. THAT MAKES A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT AS TO WHY THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE LEGALLY AND MAKING THESE DECISIONS, AND THEREFORE, A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS THE POLICY OF UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] >> YES? >> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AND CLEAN ENERGY, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU WOULD DO TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE DIRTY ENERGY THAT WE RELY ON SO MUCH LIKE COAL. >> THE QUESTION IS, MOVING US TO CLEANER ENERGY, WHAT WOULD I DO TO TRY TO MOVE US AWAY FROM COAL AND NUCLEAR. I DO NOT RELY ON NUCLEAR ENERGY. WE DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE NUCLEAR ORDER TO MEET OUR DEMANDS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE THE TRANSITION TO GET TO WHERE WE MUST BE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE ENERGY OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO POWER OUR ECONOMY MUST TURN QUICKLY FROM RENEWABLE AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES. I DO NOT THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE SIGNING A NEW NUCLEAR PLANTS. I HAVE BEEN OPEN TO RESEARCH TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN STORE THE WASTE MORE SAFELY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE WASTE. CAN WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THE NUCLEAR PLANT NEAR MY HOME IS ALWAYS LINKING NUCLEAR MATERIAL INTO THE GROUNDWATER KIDD IS ALWAYS IN THE FRONT PAGES. WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO FACE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- TO FORCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REGULATE THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN ON THAT FRONT. WHEN IT COMES TO COLE, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A CRASH COURSE THAT MOVES US TOWARD DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO SEE IF IT IS REALISTIC TO SEQUESTER CARBON OF. THERE IS AN OLD COAL-FIRED PLANT THAT IS WILLING TO TRY TO MOVE TOWARDS CARBON SEQUESTRATION. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO RELY ON: BUT IS PRODUCED THE WAY IT IS PRODUCED NOW. WE ALSO CANNOT STOP RELYING ON COAL UNTIL WE COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVES. I DO NOT WANT US TO CITE ANY MORE COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS UNLESS THERE ARE GOING TO USE THE CLEANEST TECHNOLOGY, HAVE EVERY POSSIBLE SAFEGUARD ON WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING INTO THE AIR, AND WE DO THE SEQUESTRATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS HOW I DEAL WITH BOTH COAL AND NUCLEAR. THAT GENTLEMAN RIGHT THERE. YES SIR? >> GREAT QUESTION. I HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH DURING HIS CAMPAIGN BASED ON THE WORK THAT I HAVE DONE FOR 35 YEARS. OBVIOUSLY, SOME OF THESE ARE ONE TO COST MONEY. WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM? THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS TO STOP THE WAR IN IRAQ. WE COULD THEN INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY AND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. I WILL NOT EXTEND THE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS. MIGHT CUT OFF THERE IS $250,000 IN INCOME. THAT REALIZES ABOUT $55 BILLION A YEAR. I WOULD PUT THAT MONEY INTO A STARTUP FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IN ORDER TO GET THE KIND OF MODERNIZATION OF THE SYSTEM, GET THE TAX CREDITS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY DESERVE, AND I WANT TO CLOSE THE TAX INEQUITY THAT EXISTS IN OUR SYSTEM. A WALL STREET MONEY MANAGER PAYS LESS THAN A TEACHER DOES. THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS. WARREN BUFFETT IS I FAVOR BILLION YEN. HE HAS BEGUN TO EVENS WITH ME -- WARREN BUFFETT IS MY FAVORITE BILLIONAIRE. WARREN BUFFETT WAS PAYING 17%, AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS PAYING BETWEEN 25% AND 30%. I THINK AND THAT BREEDS THIS FEELING OF INEQUITY IN AMERICA. I WANT TO GET BACK TO A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING HARD AND TRYING TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE AND TAKING CARE OF AN AGING RELATIVE. ALSO WANT TO GET THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY AND THEM. I WANT TO CUT 500,000 OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS. WE ARE OUTSOURCING THE GOVERNMENT, AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, WE ARE NOT SAVING MONEY DOING IT. WE ARE JUST PUSHING A LOT OF MONEY TOWARDS PRIVATE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE POLITICALLY CONNECTED. I DO NOT THINK THAT IS FAIR. I DO NOT THINK THAT IS DRY. I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT. EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE PROPOSED IN MY CAMPAIGN, I TELL YOU I WILL PAY FOR IT. -- I TELL YOU HOW I WILL PAY FOR IT. GEORGE BUSH HAS MORTGAGED OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN SOME OF GEORGE BUSH'S ECONOMIC POLICY BY THE SAME BAR MONEY FROM THE CHINESE -- YOU CAN SUM UP GEORGE BUSH'S ECONOMIC POLICY BY SAYING BORROW MONEY FROM THE CHINESE AND BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. THIS TILMAN IN THE HAT, RIGHT THERE. -- THIS GENTLEMAN IN THE HAT, RIGHT THERE. >> [INAUDIBLE] HAVE BEEN IN BUILDINGS THAT ARE VACANT AND JOBS OF ONTO CHINA HAVE GONE TO CHINA. >> GREAT QUESTION. THIS MAN IS A COMMERCIAL REAL- ESTATE BROKER AND HE GOES IN AND OUT OF FACTORIES AND COMMERCIAL SPACES. HE HAS SEEN SO MANY BUILDINGS THAT ARE NOW VACANT AND THEY HAVE LOST THE JOBS THAT HAVE MOVED TO CHINA. HE HAS A GREAT LINE THAT I MAY STEAL. GEORGE W. BUSH IS THE GREATEST ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEER FOR CHINA. I SHARE THAT CONCERN. I HOPE TO START A CAUCUS IN THE SENATE CALL THE MANUFACTURING CAUCUS. I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN REMAIN A GREAT COUNTRY IF YOU DO NOT MAKE THINGS. I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU CAN DO IT. [APPLAUSE] OCH HALF I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO GET BACK TO CREATING JOBS NOT LOSING THEM. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THAT. ANYBODY WHO EXPORTS A JOB SHOULD NOT GET ONE PENNY OF TAXPAYER HELP TO DO IT. THAT IS STILL HAPPENING. THEY ARE ABLE TO CALL ON A LOT OF THESE TAX BREAKS, AND SOMETIMES COMPANIES DO NOT SEE THE TRUTH. THEY TAKE THE TAX BREAKS THAT ARE MEANT TO KEEP JOBS IN A CERTAIN PLACE, AND THE NEXT MINUTE THE ARGON WE HADY ARE GONE. WE HAVE TO GET TOUGHER ON ENFORCING OUR TRADE RULES. WE HAVE TO FORCE CHINA TO LIVE UP TO THEIR TRADE AGREEMENTS. TO ME, THIS IS A NO-BRAINER. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE TRADE AGREEMENTS BECAUSE IT IS GOOD TO HAVE TRADE IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE BEEN LARGELY ADVANCED BY TRADE. I'M NOT WANT TO BE TAKEN FOR A SUCKER. I DO NOT WANT TO BE TRADING AWAY AMERICA'S MIDDLE-CLASS STANDARD OF LIFE. I DO NOT WANT TO BE TRADING AWAY OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE DO NOT HAVE ENFORCEABLE LABOR AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. WE HAVE TOYS WITH LEAD IN THEM ARMED CONTAMINATED FOOD. -- WE HAVE TOYS WITH LEAD IN THEM AND CONTAMINATED FOOD. WE IMPORT STUFF THAT DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARDS, AND I AM WANT TO IN THE THAT. -- AND I AM GOING TO DO - I AM GOING TO END AT THAT. IT IS VERY THREATENING TO THE STABILITY OF OUR ECONOMY TO CONTINUE SEE THESE JOBS LOST. WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THE CREATION OF NEW JOBS. AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I WAS RECENTLY IN A SOLAR ENERGY FACTORY IN SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT DID NOT EXIST FIVE YEARS AGO. NOW IT EMPLOYS 350 PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. SENATOR TOM,>> SENATOR CLINTON, [INAUDIBLE] >> SHE WORKS IN HOME AND SECURITY HERE IN THE STATE AND WANTS TO KNOW WHAT MY VIEWS ON. AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, I HAVE VERY STRONG VIEWS ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO BE PREPARED AND READY. I THINK THAT THE WAY THE BUSH SAID ADMINISTRATION HAS MISUSED FEMA, STAFFING IT WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT QUALIFIED, AND YOU KNOW THAT FIRST HAND. I THINK IT IS AN OUTRAGE. WE HAD A FEMA ORGANIZATION THAT HAD DONE A SUPERB JOB DEALING WITH ALL KINDS OF NATURAL DISASTERS. THEY CAME IN AND BEGAN TO CLEAN HOUSE AND TURNED INTO A DUMPING GROUND FOR PEOPLE THAT THEY OWED POLITICAL FAVORS TO. THAT IS HOW WE IN THE UP WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE HORSE ASSOCIATION HEADING UP FEMA. THERE WAS NOTHING ON HIS REMAIN SO SHOWING THAT HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. I WAS AGAINST PUTTING A TEAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOME AND SECURITY. -- I WAS AGAINST PUTTING FEMA IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY PUT HIM QUALIFIED PEOPLE. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DEMORALIZED AGENCIES. AS SOON AS 9/11 HAPPEN, I TOLD THEM TO GET THE MONEY OUT TO THE LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PICK UP THE PHONE WHEN YOU DIAL 911. DON'T HAVE IT STUCK IN A STATE CAPITAL, BUT DID IT DOWN AND GET IT OUT. WE HAVE MADE SOM PROGRESS. THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE HAS MADE PROGRESS. MY OFFICE WENT TO THAT HORRIBLE HOSTAGE CRISIS SOME WEEKS AGO WITH A YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS AND VOLUNTEERS BEING TERRORIZED BY THIS MAN WHO WAS MENTALLY ILL. I WAS ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY WITH YOUR PEOPLE. BUT WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A NATIONAL SYSTEM. WE DO NOT HAVE EVERYBODY CONNECTED UP THE WAY WE NEED TO CONNECT THEM OUT. THAT IS WHAT IS MISSING. ONE OF THE OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT I WORKED ON WAS TO GET A NATIONAL 911 SYSTEM AND REQUIRE THE CELL PHONE COMPANIES TO PUT A CHIP IN CELL PHONES SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY LOCATE YOU WHEN YOU CALL 911. YOU MIGHT BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HAVE A 2 0202 AREA CODE, BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN AN EMERGENCY WILL HAPPEN. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN GREAT BRITAIN. TONY BLAIR LEAVES AND THE NEXT DAY, THERE IS A TERRORIST ATTACK. YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED ON DAY ONE WITH EVERYTHING READY TO GO. I AM AFRAID THAT WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO GET US IN SHAPE WHEN IT COMES TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. [APPLAUSE] OH MY GOODNESS, SO MANY HANDS. YES, BACK THERE? >> [INAUDIBLE] I JUST WONDER, [INAUDIBLE] >> I KNOW THAT. YOU WERE IN FOSTER CHILD? AND NOW YOU ARE IN FOSTER PARENT? AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO DO TO HELP FOSTER KIDS? [APPLAUSE] IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT I CARE MORE ABOUT THESE KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN ABUSED AND NEGLECTED. THESE ARE KIDS THAT BECOME ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. WE HAVE NOT DONE A VERY GOOD JOB TAKING CARE OF HAVE WORKED TO TRY TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT DECISIONS. I HAVE WORKED TO CREATE A TAX CREDIT SO PEOPLE WILL HAVE FINANCIAL HELP IF THEY BEGAN TO BECOME FOSTER PARENTS. I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING TO TRY TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR KIDS THE AGE OUT OF FOSTER CARE. YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. IN MOST, WHEN YOU TURN 18 OR GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, -- IN MOST STATES, WHEN YOU TOURNEY TEAM OF GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, THEY HAND YOU A BLACK GARBAGE BAG AND TELL YOU TO PUT YOUR BELONG)NGS AND THAT AND YOU ARE OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WE HAVE 25,000 KIDS WHO AGE OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM EVERY YEAR. THE ARE ON THEIR OWN. THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY BACKUP. DID NOT HAVE ANYONE WAITING FOR THEM. SOME OF THEM GO BACK TO THE ONLY PLACE THEY KNEW WHETHER OR NOT THE CONDITIONS ARE HEALTHY OR SET. WE BEGAN -- HEALTHY OR SICK. WE BEGIN TO TRY TO KEEP SOME OF THESE SERVICES BILLING SO THAT IF YOU WERE ON MEDICAID, YOU WOULD NOT LOSE YOUR HEALTH CARE AFTER YOU LEFT THE SYSTEM. THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ORPHAN FOUNDATION THAT HELPS SEND FOSTER KIDS TO COLLEGE. I AM TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THAT. I CONTRIBUTE TO IT AND I HELP THEM. THERE ARE FOSTER KIDS WHO NEEDED TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO TRY TO IMPROVE OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO TRY TO KEEP KIDS SAFE AND HEALTHY WHILE THEY ARE IN FOSTER CARE. IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC IDEAS BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE, I HOPE HE WILL TELL ME. I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN. I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT THIS. I HAVE HAD THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WORK FOR ME WHO ARE IN COLLEGE. IT IS OFTEN A MIRACLE THAT THEY SURVIVED AND ARE IN COLLEGE JUST IMAGINE BEING IN COLLEGE, AND THE DORMS CLOSED FOR CHRISTMAS BREAK. YOU MAY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. ALL YOUR CLASSMATES ARE GOING HOME FOR THANKSGIVING. YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE THE CONDITION OF OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND OUR KIDS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR MY PRESIDENCY. IT IS NOT THE KIND OF POSITION THAT WILL MAKE HEADLINES, BUT I WILL NEED YOUR HELP TO DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> THIS IS REGARDING THE SUB PRIME. [INAUDIBLE] ALL THE PEOPLE THAT BAR THE MONEY, THEY ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS. NO ONE SEEMS TO TALK ABOUT BLAMING THE PERSON WHO BORROWED THE MONEY. THE ALWAYS WANT TO BLAME THE OTHER SIDE. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT? >> THE GENTLEMAN SAYS THAT IN THE HOUSE OF PRIME MORTGAGE OF MASS, THE LENDERS AND INVESTORS AND BROKERS, THEY DESERVE THE BLAME THAT THEY HAVE FOR CREATING THIS MESS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THE BAR OF THE MONEY. PEOPLE THAT ARE ADULTS DEBT ENTERED INTO MORTGAGES THAT THEY COULD NOT PAY OR DID NOT UNDERSTAND. I AM A STRONG BELIEVER IN INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. I WAS RAISED THAT WAY AND I BELIEVE THAT IS ONE OF THE CORE VALUES THAT WE AS AMERICANS BELIEVE IN AND PROMOTE. I AM TRYING TO SORT OUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BORROWERS. THERE WERE MANY BORROWERS TO PUT INTO SUBPRIMAL ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES WHO QUALIFY FOR CONVENTIONAL FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES I THINK THAT DAY, VERY WELL, WERE MISLED. THEY WERE TOLD ONE THING AND GOT SOMETHING ELSE. I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WENT INTO THESE MORTGAGES DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. FIRST-TIME HOMEOWNERS ARE STRIVERS, FIRST-GENERATION AMERICANS. THEY GET INTO A HOME AND THE COMMON WISDOM YOU HERE FROM FAMILY AND IN FRANCE ESSAYED TO PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE AS SOON AS I CAN. AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. THERE ARE A LOT OF SPECULATORS WHO WENT INTO THIS, THINKING THAT HOME PRICES WILL ALWAYS RISE. AT THIS POINT, THE PROBLEM IS SO BIG AND THAT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS LOSING THEIR HOMES, IS ABOUT THE CASCADING EFFECT IN THE A ECONOMY. I THINK WE HAVE TO STOP THE BLEEDING. IF THAT MEANS SOME PEOPLE WHO SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER AND GET A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF BECAUSE OF ALL THESE MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO COULD STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND PAY THE INTEREST THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING ASKED, OR COULD BE, WITH THE HELP OF COUNCILORS, WORK OUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND STAY IN THEIR HOME, OR COULD CONVERT IT TO AN OWNERSHIP RENTAL AGREEMENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO WORK THIS OUT. THIS IS NOT A FREE RIDE. THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. THERE IS ENOUGH BLAME TO GO AROUND. I THINK THE INVESTORS AND LENDERS AND BROKERS AND A BAR WORST OF ALL GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE TO WORK THIS OUT FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE ECONOMY. ONCE THESE HOUSES ARE GETTING FORECLOSED ON, NEIGHBORHOODS WILL START TO DETERIORATE AND SERVICES WILL START TO DETERIORATE. WE ARE HAVE $100 A BARREL OIL. WE HAVE THE DOLLAR AT A HISTORIC LOW. WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE ECONOMY. I THINK WHERE WE CAN INTERVENE, WHICH TO TRY TO DO THAT. YES? [APPLAUSE] >> [INAUDIBLE] >> , GREAT QUESTION. HER FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT EDUCATION. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO TRY TO INCREASE TEACHER SALARIES. BECAUSE, YOU ARE RIGHT, THERE ARE NOT COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER COLLEGE-EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. IT IS A REAL PROBLEM. IT BECOMES COMPOUND WHEN IS TEACHERS GRADUATE WITH SO MUCH DEBT. IF YOU GO INTO TEACHING, FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS, WE WILL FORGIVE YOUR DEBT. I THINK THAT WE WILL START WITH AREAS OF GREAT SHORTAGE AND NEED, LIKE POOR RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AREAS OF SHORTAGE AND NEED. I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST PRIORITY. SECONDLY, I DO THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN HELP PROVIDE A PLAN TO INCREASE TEACHER SALARIES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROMISED, 31 YEARS AGO, THAT IT WOULD PAY 30 PERCENT OF THE COST OF EDUCATION. I HAVE VOTED TWICE TO HAVE BE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAID MORE, THERE WOULD BE MONEY FREED UP FOR TEACHERS' SALARIES. THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE SYSTEM. I WANT TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY. WITH RESPECT TO GAY AMERICANS, I BELIEVE, STRONGLY, THAT WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARD EQUALITY. I KNOW THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE PUT INTO AFFECT ITS CIVIL UNION LONG, WHICH I AND HIS -- [APPLAUSE] VERY IMPORTANT. PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING UNDER THOSE LAWS AND HAVE FULFILLED THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PUT UPON CITIZENS IN THE STATE'S FORCEABLE UNIONS -- STATES FOR SEVERAL UNIONS, I AM GOING TO MOVE TO TRY TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO YOU. AS WELL AS IN IN JOB DISCRIMINATION IN LENDING ALL OF THE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS WE STILL FACE IN AMERICA OVER HATE CRIMES. THERE IS A LOT THAT I WANT TO DO. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE MOVES TOWARD EQUALITY THAT AMERICA HAS MADE IT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. WE ARE JUST WANT TO GO AFTER IT. [APPLAUSE] YES, BACK THERE? >> WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU GOT INTO YOUR SYSTEM? SO THE EPOXY GLUE, THE GLUE AND EVERYTHING. YES, I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT. >> IT AFFECTED MY, JIM. I ATTEMPTED TO GET SOCIAL SECURITY. HERE I AM STUCK WITH NO HEALTH INSURANCE, NO WAY TO WORK, REPETITIVE MOTIONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE. IT WAS NOT FOR MY SISTER, I WOULD BE OUT ON THE STREETS AND PROBABLY DEAD. I DON'T KNOW, BUT HALF THE DOCTORS ARE TELLING ME THERE IS NO WAY THAT I CAN GO TO WORK, AND THE OTHER HALF SAY IT IS MY WORK ETHIC THAT IS THE PROBLEM. >> LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTION A COUPLE OF WAYS. I WOULD STAY UNTIL EVERYBODY LEFT, BUT I'M WENT TO HIS ANSWER HIS QUESTION. HE WAS EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD, MAINLY AN EPOXY. HIS SYSTEM, WHOSE GENETIC MAKEUP MADE HIM SUSCEPTIBLE AND HE HAS SUFFERED FROM ILL HEALTH EFFECTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. UNDER MY PLAN, YOU WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND WILL RECEIVE HEALTH CARE. AND SECONDLY, THE WHOLE QUESTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE REVIEWED. THEY DO NOT WANT ANYBODY TO GET ANY HELP MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. FINALLY, ON WHAT TO SAY THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THE IMPACT OF THE ENVIRONMENT TO THE EXTENT WE NEED TO KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HEALTH. THERE ARE THREE WAYS THAT YOU HAVE LESS THAN OPTIMAL HEALTH. A GENETIC PREDISPOSITIONS AND SUSCEPTIBILITIES TO DISEASE, BEHAVIOR, LIKE SMOKING AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AMONG THE MANY REASONS THAT W[ MUST LEARN THAT THE ENVIRONMENT, THIS IS I'M NOT ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, BUT ABOUT CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. THERE ARE DEFINITE HEALTH THE FAX. YOU CAN TRACK THEM, YOU CAN SEE THEM, WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THEM. I HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TRACKING SYSTEM. WE TRACK INFECTIOUS DISEASES PRETTY WELL. IF SOMEONE COMES IN WITH SOME INFECTIOUS DISEASE, WE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK IT THROUGH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT THESE CLUSTERS. WE ARE NOT TRACKING THE HALIFAX -- THE HILT THE FACTS. LOOK AT AUTISM. WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF AUTISM. 100 P -- ONE AT EVERY 150 CHILDREN IS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. THIS IS A DEBILITATING CONDITION. IT RUNS THE GAMUT FROM RELATIVELY MILD TO TERRIBLY PROFOUND. WHY IS IT INCREASING IN AMERICA? WHAT IS THE ANSWER. WHAT IS IT THAT WE ARE EXPOSING PREGNANT WOMEN TO OR BABIES TO THAT TRIGGERS THEIR GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY? I AM GOING TO FIND OUT. THE ARE GOING TO TRACK THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT COULD UNDERMINE OUR HELP. [APPLAUSE] A FINAL QUESTION? >> ONE AND SHOULD COME ON A PEER? WHAT IS YOUR NAME? >> SUSAN. WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS PLAY. >> THAT IS SO GREAT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT LETS MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER.",2015-11-07 17:11:07,2008-01-05,Penacook,New Hampshire

[APPLAUSE] WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY BETTER WAY TO START TODAY THAN TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH YOU GUYS. WE SOMETIMES NEED TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THOSE OF US WHO ARE REPUBLICANS HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS ANYBODY, AND TODAY, WE WANT TO PROVE IT. THE OTHER NIGHT, I HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH KEVIN EUBANKS AND ""THE TONIGHT SHOW"" BAND, BUT THEY ARE NOT ANY BETTER THAN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS ALL MAMA KICKS, AND I WANT TO PLAY WITH THEM A COUPLE OF SONGS TODAY, SO GIVE IT UP, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN, AND LET'S ROCK THE HOUSE.

THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> OK, WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT MAMA KICKS? I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY HAD THAT MUCH FUN AT HILLARY'S RALLY? I DOUBT THEY DID, BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN HERE THIS AFTERNOON. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO EVERYBODY FOR COMING OUT. WE HAVE HAD AN AMAZING FEW HOURS. WE LEFT IOWA LATE LAST NIGHT ABOUT 12:30 IN THE MORNING. WE ACTUALLY ARRIVED HERE ABOUT QUARTER 4:00. OPERATING AT ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF POSE ASLEEP. ONE OF THE REASONS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME MUSIC IS MAMA KICKS IS WHEN THE CAFFEINE OUT OF THE COFFEE WILL NOT QUITE KEEP YOU GOING, MAMA KICKS WILL. WE NEEDED TO GET A LITTLE BIT WAKED UP HERE THIS AFTERNOON. I WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR COMING UNPACKING THE RAFTERS AND WALLS. WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. I LOOK FOR TO HAVING A CHANCE TO VISIT WITH YOU, BUT I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOMEBODY WHO I BELIEVE IS ONE OF THE TRULY AMAZING PEOPLE THAT I'VE COME TO KNOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW HIM BECAUSE HE IS IN THE MOVIES, HAS BEEN ON TELEVISION FOR MANY YEARS. MANY PEOPLE KNOW HIM BECAUSE -- I MEAN, THERE'S THE MAN. THERE IS A LEGEND. BUT TODAY, YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE, TO MEET, AND TO HEAR THE REAL THING. HE IS ALSO A GREAT AMERICAN WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY AND WHO LOVES STUDENTS AND HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED KICKSTART THAT IS HELPING MORE INNER-CITY AND UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS TO GAIN SELF-ESTEEM AND LEARN HOW TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. I'M SO THRILLED HE IS HERE TO CAMPAIGN WITH ME. I WANT YOU TO GIVE A GREAT GRANITE STATE WELCOME TO THE ONE AND ONLY SHOP NORRIS. [APPLAUSE] -- CHOCK NORRIS -- CHUCK NORRIS. [APPLAUSE] >> THANKS A LOT. IT IS REALLY A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THREE MONTHS AGO, I DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHO MIGHT HUCKABEE -- MIKE HUCKABEE WAS. I WAS WATCHING REPUBLICAN DEBATES, AND IT LOOKED LIKE THE ROMNEY-GIULIANI SHOW. WE WERE CONFUSED OVER WHO WE REALLY WANTED TO GET BEHIND. THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I STARTED GETTING E-MAILS FROM YOUNG PEOPLE, YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS, AND TWO YOUNG MEN FROM OREGON CALLED THE HARRIS WINS -- THEY HAVE A WEB SITE CALLED REBELO UTION. IT MEANS TEENAGERS RAISING LOW EXPECTATIONS IN AMERICA. MAKING EVERYONE RISE ABOVE WHAT PEOPLE THINK THEIR LOW EXPECTATIONS ARE. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE WEBSITE. ANYWAY, THEY E-MAIL ME, AND I GOT FEMALES FROM OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS SAYING THEY WERE BACKING MIKE HUCKABEE FOR PRESIDENT. SO WE SAID IF ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO ENTHUSED ABOUT THIS MAN, WE NEED TO CHECK HIM OUT. SO WE WENT ON THE WEBSITE, STARTED CHECKING HIM OUT, RESEARCHING HIM, READING THE ARTICLES THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HIM -- THE MORE WE READ ABOUT THIS MAN, THE MORE IMPRESSED WE BECAME WITH MIKE HUCKABEE. ANYWAY, I STARTED -- I HAVE A WEEKLY ARTICLE ON WORLDNETDAILY THAT I WRITE, AND I STARTED WRITING ABOUT THE THINGS I LIKED ABOUT HIM IN MY ARTICLES. ANYWAY, HIS STAFF STARTED READING MY ARTICLES, SO THEY CALLED ME AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD DO A PROMO FOR HIM. I SAID I WOULD BE GLAD TO. I'M ENDORSING HIM. I'M BEGGING HIM. ANYTHING I WOULD BE -- ANYTHING I COULD DO TO HELP HIM, I WOULD BE GLAD TO. I HAVE A RANCH IN TEXAS RIGHT OUTSIDE HOUSTON. SO ANYWAY, THEY SLOW UP TO THE RANCH, AND THEY WANTED TO DO THIS PROLOGUE -- PROMO. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT. [APPLAUSE] HE SAYS I HAVE TWO WORDS FOR IMMIGRATION, THAT IS CHUCK NORRIS. ANYWAY, DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS CHUCK NORRIS FACTS THING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS? IT IS AMAZING. ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO, I STARTED GETTING THESE CHUCK NORRIS FACTS ON MY E-MAIL. I WAS READING THEM AND SET THESE THINGS LOOK PRETTY FUNNY. EVERYONE ALWAYS ASKS ME WHICH ONE IS MY FAVORITE. I'LL SAY THAT THEY WANTED TO PUT CHUCK NORRIS ON MOUNT RUSHMORE, BUT THE GRANITE WAS NOT TOUGH ENOUGH FOR HIS BEARD. [APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, WE DID THIS LITTLE PROMO. ANYWAY, IT WENT UP ON YOUTUBE, GETTING 1.5 MILLION HITS IN ONE DAY. [APPLAUSE] SO BECAUSE OF THAT SPARK, IT REALLY SPARKMIKE GOING. THE THING IS, IT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE MESSAGE BEHIND IT. -- IT --MIKE -- IT REALLY GOT MIKE GOING. IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN IF HE DID NOT HAVE A MESSAGE THAT RESONATES WITH AMERICA. AND HE DOES. MIKE HAS A VISION NOT TO BE STATUS QUO LIKE WE HAVE BEEN GOING. IT HAS BEEN THE SAME THING EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IT STILL STAYS STATUS QUO. AND WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THAT. EDUCATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO ME. THAT IS WHY I STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED KICKSTART. I TEACH MARTIAL ARTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I GRADUATED 50,000 KIDS OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] I CURRENTLY HAVE 6000 KIDS IN THE PROGRAM. WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT THE PROGRAM, THE MARTIAL ARTS PROGRAM THAT I HAVE, IS THAT IT WORKS BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. THE LEFT SIDE IS YOUR LOGIC SIDE AND THE RIGHT SIDE IS MORE CREATIVE SIDE, AND MARTIAL ARTS IS A WAY OF WORKING BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. MOST OF OUR KIDS -- ONE AT RISK A GOT A FULL SCHOLARSHIP TO MIT. MANY OF THEM HAVE GRADUATED WITH DEGREES. IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. THE THING IS THAT MIKE SEES THIS. HE KNOWS THE EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. I'M FULLY ON BOARD WITH HIM. ANOTHER THING IS OUR TAX STRUCTURE. OUR TAX STRUCTURE IS COMPLETELY OUTDATED. THE IRS IS ARCHAIC. IT IS OUTDATED, AND IT IS TIME TO MAKE A CHANGE. THE MIDDLE CLASS PAPER SAID OF THE TAXES IN AMERICA -- THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE. IT IS TIME FOR CORPORATE AMERICA TO BE PAYING THAT 80 PERCENT TAXES. [APPLAUSE] I'M BITING OFF MY NOSE BECAUSE I'M PART OF THAT. I'M IN THE UPPER 10 PERCENT, BUT I DO NOT MIND. I GROW UP POOR AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO STRUGGLE AND ACHIEVE THE SUCCESSES IN MY LIFE, BUT THE THING IS -- IT IS NOT FAIR. FOR YEARS, I SAID, WHY SHOULD I PAY MY FAIR SHARE OF TAXES IF ALL THE OTHER CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE? THAT WAS ALWAYS MY REASONING, BUT I DID NOT FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. I DID NOT FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT BECAUSE MY CONSCIENCE WAS REALLY BOTHERING ME. THE THING IS THAT MIKE CAME UP WITH THE SOLUTION TO BE ABLE TO LET THE MIDDLE CLASS KEEP ALL THEIR MONEY AND LET CORPORATE AMERICA PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. THE THING IS WHEN THEY GO OUT AND BUY THEIR YACHTS, THEIR JETS, MAKE THEM PAY FOR IT. WE WERE AT A STORE ONE DAY WHEN A PRINCE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST CAME OVER AND BOUGHT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE, TOOK IT, PUT IT ON HIS FOUR JUMBO JETS AND FLEW BACK TO THE MIDDLE EAST, PAYING NO TAXES. IS THAT FAIR? HE SHOULD BE PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE OF TAXES WHEN HE COMES OVER HERE. LET THEM BE THE ONES THE SUPPORT AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE THING -- MIKE HUCKABEE HAS THIS VISION. I'M TELLING YOU -- NOTHING IRRITATES ME MORE THAN MEETING IN THE PRESS WENT MITT ROMNEY SAYS MIKE H IS A BAPTIST MINISTER. -- MIKE HUCKABEE IS A BAPTIST MINISTER LIKE HE JUST THAT OF THE PULPIT AND IS TRYING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR FOR 12 YEARS IN ARKANSAS. WHEN HE TOOK OVER THE GOVERNORSHIP IN ARKANSAS, THERE WERE $200 MILLION IN DEBT. WHEN HE LEFT, THERE WERE $860 MILLION IN THE BLACK. HE IS A GOOD STEWARD OF HIS MONEY. [APPLAUSE] LOOK WHAT HE HAS DONE ON THIS CAMPAIGN. ON THIS CAMPAIGN, HE HAS BEEN OUTSPENT 20 TO ONE. HE STILL WON IN IOWA. IT SHOWS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONCERNED HOW MUCH MONEY YOU SPEND. THE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THE MESSAGE YOU ARE GIVING THEM TO LEAD US INTO THE FUTURE PROSPEROUS THE END PEACEFULLY. THAT IS WHAT MIKE HUCKABEE IS DOING. [APPLAUSE] MY WIFE REMINDED ME TO REMIND ALL YOUNG PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND VOTE. [APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT. EVERYONE SAYS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CAMPAIGN WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO OUT AND VOTE ANYWAY. BELIEVE ME -- I DO NOT HAVE -- I'M NOT TOUGH ENOUGH FOR THAT JOB. PEOPLE SAY, ""MUSTAFA -- YOU OR MIKE HUCKABEE?"" -- ""WHO IS TOUGHER?"" HE IS OUT THERE LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO FOR AMERICA. I'M NOT THAT TOUGH. I COULD CHOKE SOMEBODY OUT, BUT I'M NOT TOUGH ENOUGH TO DO THAT. THE THING IS THAT IS WHAT MIKE HUCKABEE IS. HE IS A TOUGH GUY. WHEN WE WERE AT THE RANCH -- I HAVE A 2000 SQUARE FOOT GYM WHERE I TRAIN. I THOUGHT I WOULD TEST HIM. I SAID I WAS GETTING READY TO WORK OUT AND ASKED IF YOU LIKE TO WORK OUT WITH ME. I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH MOXIE HE HAD. HE SAID SURE, THAT HE WOULD BE GLAD TO. I SAID, GOOD, LET'S GO PUT ON THE GLOVES. ANYWAY, I HAVE TO SAY, MIKE HUCKABEE IS A STAND-UP GUY. WE DID SOME SPARRING, TECHNIQUES, AND HE STAYED RIGHT IN THERE WITH ME. I SAID THIS WAS GOOD, THAT HE WAS A STAND-UP GUY. [APPLAUSE] THE THING IS IS THAT MIKE HUCKABEE IS THE MAN. HE CAN LEAD US PROSPEROUS THE TO THE FUTURE. LIKE I SAY, I DO NOT WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO, LIKE I DID, IS GO ON HIS WEBSITE. CHECK HIM OUT. DECIDE FOR YOURSELVES IF THIS IS THE MAN YOU FEEL SHOULD LEAD OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT I DID. I DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MAN. I WAS UNDECIDED. WHEN I STARTED CHECKING HIM OUT, GOING ON THE WEBSITE, I SAW WHAT A GREAT MAN THIS GUY IS. THAT IS ALL I'M ENCOURAGING YOU TO DO. JUST GO ON THE WEBSITE AND CHECK HIM OUT. THEN, IT YOU FEEL LIKE I DO, I HOPE YOU'LL GO TO THE POLLS NEXT TUESDAY AND VOTE FOR THIS MAN. THAT IS ON ASKING. THE THING IS, IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT IDEA, THAT IS WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT AMERICA. YOU HAVE YOUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AND I HAVE CHOSEN MIKE HUCKABEE. I BELIEVE HE IS A MAN THAT SHOULD LEAD OUR COUNTRY, AND I HOPE YOU ALL FEEL THE SAME WAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU, CHUCK. >> A K, SO CHUCK SAID HE WOULD NOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THAT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY. I'M AFRAID HE WOULD BEAT ME. BUT I HAVE AN IDEA. I THINK YOU GUYS WILL LIKE THIS. WHAT ABOUT CHUCK NORRIS FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE? [APPLAUSE] AND IF NOTHING ELSE, AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE THE SECURITY DETAIL FOR THE SECRET SERVICE. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR COMING UP. WE HAVE HAD A LITTLE FUN THIS AFTERNOON. I HOPE THAT DOES NOT BOTHER ANYBODY. SOMETIMES I THINK ONE OF THE REAL CHALLENGES OF POLITICS IS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE TAKE THEMSELVES MORE SERIOUSLY THAN THEY TAKE THE ISSUES THAT TOUCH THIS COUNTRY. I'M A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT TIME -- HAS A GREAT TIME IN LIFE. THAT BOTHERS SOME PEOPLE. I HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED LATELY BECAUSE I SEEM TO BE HAPPY ABOUT LIKE. CRITICIZED BECAUSE I HAVE FUN. SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WILL SAY THEY THINK IT IS A SERIOUS JOB. SO ALIVE. BEING PRESIDENT IS A SERIOUS JOB. RUNNING THIS COUNTRY IS SERIOUS BUSINESS. -- SO DO I.. BUT THERE IS A REASON THAT I'M ABLE TO HAVE FUN, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS. I LOVE AMERICA, AND THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY, AND THERE ARE NOT MANY PLACES ON THIS PLANET THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE AS HAPPY AS WE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE THING WE HAVE CALLED FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. IT IS THE GREATEST GIFT THAT HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN TO US BY OUR GOD AND OUR FOREFATHERS. I'M REALLY PROUD OF BEING A STATE THAT UNDERSTANDS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LIBERTY AND FREEDOM AND CERTAINLY ABOUT INDEPENDENCE. NEW HAMPSHIRE DECLARED ITS INDEPENDENCE SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY FINALLY CAME AROUND TO WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE FIGURED OUT. THAT IS THE INDEPENDENCE AND HAVING A SPIRIT OF LIBERTY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE. PATRICK HENRY SAID IT -- ""GIVE US LIBERTY OR GIVE US DESK."" -- DEATH."" I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU BETTER LET THESE FOLKS LIVE FREE, OR YOU WILL DIE. THAT IS HOW IT GOES. LAST NIGHT, WHEN WE LEFT IOWA, I LEFT VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN THAT STATE THAT PROVED THAT MONEY IN POLITICS IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS A MESSAGE IN POLITICS. IT IS A GREAT STATEMENT BY THOSE FOLKS LAST NIGHT. THEY PROVED THAT THEY WERE NOT FOR SALE. THEY PROVED THAT THEY WERE NOT EVEN FOR RENT. THEY PROVED THAT THEY WANTED A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS BASED UPON HOW CANDIDATES STOOD ON THE ISSUES, NOT WHAT THEY COULD FIND WRONG WITH SOMETHING ELSE, EVEN IF THEY HAD TO MAKE IT UP. I THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE THAT PARTVERY IDEA. AND TO PROVE THAT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY CANDIDATE HAS RAISED, BUT WHAT KIND OF FUTURE AND IDEAS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. IF ANY OF US HAVE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY WHEN WE RUN FOR OFFICE, IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO SAY ""LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE GUYS RUNNING AGAINST ME"" BUT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME THINGS RIGHT WITH THIS NATION, BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE COULD DO BETTER. I'M A PERSON WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD IT IS, BUT I'M RUNNING FOR OFFICE BECAUSE I KNOW IT COULD BE A LOT BETTER. I KNOW WE COULD DO BETTER IN SOME AREAS. I KNOW WE COULD DO BETTER IN PROTECTING THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE UNSECURED BORDERS AND OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EVEN REALLY TRIED TO ADDRESS. AS A RESULT, IT IS HARDER FOR YOU TO GET ON YOUR AIRPLANE YOUR HOME TOWN AND IT IS FOR PEOPLE TO GET ACROSS OUR INTERNATIONAL BORDERS, AND THAT HAS GOT TO BE FIXED. EVEN THOUGH WE GOT TO GET ON OUR KNEES EVERY NIGHT AND THANK GOD THAT WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO BREAK INTO AND NOT ONE THEY'RE TRYING TO BREAK OUT OF, EVERYBODY OUGHT TO LIVE BUT YOU'LL LOCK -- BY THE RULE LAOF LAW. IT IS NOT AN ISSUE OF SOMEHOW NOT LIKING PEOPLE, BUT WHEN EVERYONE TO COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, NOT THE BACK DOOR, AND TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY, THE LEGAL WAY, SO THAT IF THERE IS GOING TO BE IMMIGRATION, IT IS GOING TO BE DONE LEGALLY OR NOT AT ALL. THAT IS WHY I SUGGEST WE BUILD A SENSE, HAVE A CLEAR PATH WHEN THAT STARTS IN A PERSON'S HOME COUNTRY. THEY GET IN THE BACK, NOT THE FRONT OF THE LINE, AND THEY DO THINGS UNDER THE RULE LOF LAW. THAT IS HOW THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE HERE AND ANYWHERE ELSE. OUR CURRENT CONGRESS HAS FUMBLED THE BALL. AS A GOVERNOR FOR 10 AND A HALF YEARS, I FOUND THAT MANY TIMES, WE HAVE FOLKS THAT MAY DECISION S IN WASHINGTON AND HAD NO IDEA HOW IT WOULD AFFECT THESE DAYS. WE HAVE THE 10TH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS WE SHOULD HAVE STRONG STATES, STRONG, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, NOT AN OVERLY POWERFUL CENTRALIZED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE DANGER OF THAT IS THAT WHOEVER GETS CONTROL OF IT HAS TOO MUCH CONTROL AND TO MUCH POWER. . >> BY THE WAY, ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HE FACES IS GETTING A GOVERNMENT WHO KNOWS THAT ITS PURPOSE IS TO BE SERVED. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WEEK, THIS IS ABOUT A WEEK. -- THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME, THIS IS ABOUT WEEK. -- ABOUT WE. I WAS THRUST INTO OFFICE BECAUSE MINE PREDECESSOR WAS CONVICTED OF FELONIES. BY THE WAY, HE WAS AMONG A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE COMMITTED CRIMES AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS. FOR A WHILE THERE, THE FIVE MOST FEW WORDS OF AN ARKANSAS POLITICIAN WERE, ""WITH THE DEFENDANT PLEASE RISE."" YOU GOT IT. FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, JULY, 1996, I PUT A FRAME WITH A PICTURE ON THE WALL IN MY OFFICE IN LITTLE ROCK. IN THAT PICTURE FRAME, THERE WAS A BRASS INSCRIPTION THAT SAID, ""OUR BOSS."" MY PICTURE WAS NEVER IN MY FRAME -- IN THAT FRAME. IN FACT, I MADE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME REALIZED WHO THE BOSS WAS. IT WAS NOT THE GUY SITTING IN THE CORNER OFFICE WITH A VIEW OF THE ARKANSAS RIVER. EVERY WEEK OR SO, WE CHANGED THAT PHOTO. IT MIGHT BE THE PICTURE OF A COUPLE CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OR A SCOUT GETTING HIS EAGLE AWARD, OR SOME TEENAGER WHO HAD RESCUED SOMEONE IN AN ACT OF HEROISM IT MIGHT BE A SOLDIER -- HAIR WAS IN. IT MIGHT BE A SOLDIER. IT WAS ALWAYS AN ORDINARY CITIZEN MADE HIS MARK. THE PERSON IN THAT PHONE WHO WAS OUR BOSS. WE WORK FOR THAT PERSON. THAT PERSON DID NOT WORK FOR US. WHOEVER CAME THROUGH THE DOORS OR WROTE A LETTER, THEY WERE NOT INTERRUPTING US. THEY WERE NOT BOTHERING US. THAT IS WHO WE WERE ELECTED TO SERVE. WE HAD 2.7 MILLION BOSSES, AND IT WAS OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOOK CARE OF THEM FIRST. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT SAME SPIRIT TO WASHINGTON D.C. AND THE WHITE HOUSE. WE NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT I HAVE BECOME THE RULER OF THE NATION, BUT RATHER THE SERVANT OF THE NATION. THE PEOPLE STILL DO ROLE. THAT IS WHAT THEY DO EVERY TIME WE HAVE AN ELECTION. THE RULE. THEY MAKE DECISIONS. THEY MAKE CHOICES. THEY MADE THE CHOICE FOR CHANGE. WE ALL KNOW SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE, BUT IT TAKES LEADERSHIP TO GET IT FIXED. CLEARLY, WE HAVE AN ISSUE. AN ISSUE OF BEING WOUNDED AND ENSLAVED TO MIDDLE EAST OIL AND THIS WEEK, OIL WENT TO OVER $100 A BARREL. HOW LONG ARE WE WERE TO CONTINUE THOSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO INSULATE US TO THEIR OIL. IT IS TIME THAT A PRESIDENT SAYS THAT WITHIN 10 YEARS, WE WILL BECOME ENERGY INDEPENDENT WITH DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED, RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. WE CAN TELL THE SUN THE IRRADIANCE TO KEEP THEIR OIL BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED ANY MORE THAN ANY THEIR SAND. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO SAY AS A NATION. IF A COUNTRY IS ONE TO BE FREE, IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO DO THREE OWNS. ONE OF THE THINGS IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO DO -- BE ABLE TO DO THREE THINGS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS TO BE ABLE TO DO, EVERY TIME WE GO TO FILL UP AT THE PUMP, YOU ARE PAYING SO THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF TERRORISM IS ACTUALLY HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO FUNCTION. WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF WE CUT OFF THEIR SUPPLY OF TO MAKE THE VERY WEAPONS THAT THEY USE AGAINST US. STOP THE FINANCING THROUGH OUR OIL, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A MAJOR DENT IN STOPPING SOME OF THEIR CAPACITY TO DO THE DAMAGE. IT WILL NOT BE EVERYTHING. WE DO FACE A VERY SERIOUS IN A. ONE OF THE THINGS IN NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO IS HAVING THE KIND OF MILITARY THAT IS SO STRONG THAT NOBODY ON THIS EARTH WANTS TO ENGAGE IN BATTLE BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS LIKE TAKING ON CHUCK NORRIS. YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HOPING TO GET OUR MILITARY AND BEEFED UP TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS CHUCK NORRIS APPROVED. BUT WE DO HAVE TO USE THAT MILITARY, WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT IT ENTERS WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE, AND ONE THING WE WILL NOT ALLOW TO HAPPEN IS TO LET THE POLITICIANS INTERRUPT THE BATTLEFIELD COMMAND DECISIONS THAT OUGHT TO BE MADE BY PEOPLE WITH BLOOD ON THEIR BOOTS AND MEDALS ON THEIR CHEST. THAT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH MEANS THAT THERE IS LESS LIKELIHOOD, NOT MORE LIKE A, THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEND A POWERFUL SOFTWARE BATTLE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT FACES IS TO MAKE THIS ECONOMY WORK FOR EVERYBODY. MY OWN PARTY TALKS ABOUT HOW GREAT THE ECONOMY IS DOING. FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, IT IS. BUT IF YOU ARE A PERSON FOR WHOM GASOLINE PRICES MATTER, 70 CENTS A GALLON MORE THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR IS AFFECTING YOU. EVERYTHING YOU BUY, SOME MORE MONEY. IT HAS TO BE TRANSPORTED TO THE STORE. IT IS THE MILK YOU DRINK FOR THE BRILLIANT, IT COST MORE AT THE SHELF. THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT ARE PAYING MORE TODAY, BUT THEY ARE NOT MAKING MORE TODAY. THEIR INSURANCE IS COSTING MORE, PARTICULARLY THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. WE HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS. IT IS NOT JUST AT 47 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNINSURED, BUT THE GREATER CRISIS IS THAT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN. WE WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ARE CATASTROPHICALLY ILL BEFORE WE EVEN IN CASES THAN THE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO BE PUTTING THE MONEY ON THE PREVENTION SIDE, NOT ON THE INTERVENTION SIDE. WE'RE -- OUR SYSTEM IS UPSIDE DOWN. >> USA. U.S. AID. THE USA. >> WHASOME OF THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY TO MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH CARE. I AM GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DO NOT TRUST THE GOVERNMENT OR THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO TAKE CARE OF ME. I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF ME. I THINK OUR HEALTH PLAN OUGHT TO EMPOWER YOU. YOU DECIDE, WITH YOUR DOCTOR, WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU. IF SOMEBODY ELSE IS MAKING THE DECISION, THEY ARE MAKING THE DECISION BASED ON THEIR OWN POCKET, NOT ON MY HEALTH. YOU NEED TO HAVE A SAY IN THAT. THE HEALTHIER YOU LIVE, THE LESS EXPENSIVE IT IS FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOUR COURSES WILL RESULT IN BENEFITS THAT YOU CAN LIVE WITH. YOU CAN LIVE ANYWHERE YOU WANT. THERE ARE TO BE INCENTIVES TO YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYER SO THAT THE BETTER CHOICES THAT YOU MAKE, WHICH ARE YOURS TO MAKE, RESULT IN MORE AFFORDABILITY IN YOUR PLAN AND MORE PORTABILITY SO IT IS NOT JUST KIND TO WHERE YOU WERE, BUT IT IS TIED TO YOU. WHEN CHUCK WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TAX SYSTEM, A LOT OF PEOPLE DREAM OF A SMALL BUSINESS, BUT WHAT THEY FIND OUT IS THAT THERE "" -- TOUGHEST COME PETITION -- THE TOUGHEST COMPETITION IS NOT SOME GUY FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BUT SOMEONE FROM THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT. TAXATION, REGULATION, AND LITIGATION MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO FULFILL THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE NEED TO BE THE PARTY AND THE PEOPLE THAT BELIEVES IN THE STRENGTH OF THE SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER IN THE OF KRONOR. 80% OF ALL THE JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS. AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE IT SO THAT A PERSON CAN SIT DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE AND SKETCH OUT HIS OR HER IDEA. EVEN ON THE BACK OF THE DINNER NAPKIN, AND THE RESULT CAN BE THAT THAT CAN GROW INTO A BUSINESS THAT THRIVES AND HIRES PEOPLE AND BUYS THINGS AND SELLS THINGS AND CREATES AN ECONOMY. THAT IS HOW AN ECONOMY IS CREATED. WHEN PEOPLE MOVE PRODUCTS AND THINGS AND THEY BUILD THEM. WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE' PEOPLE FAIL NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WORK HARD ENOUGH, BUT THAT THEY CANNOT COMPETE WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THE REASONS WE NEED A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF OUR TAX SYSTEM IS BECAUSE THE ONE THAT WE HAVE PENALIZES PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSIDIZES ITS RESPONSIBILITY. I WAS HERE IN MANCHESTER A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS VISITING A MACHINE SHOP AND TALKING TO ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES. HE SAID THAT HE WAS WORKING TWO SHIFTS BECAUSE HE HAS A DAUGHTER IN GRAD SCHOOL A CORNELL. HIS DAUGHTERS GRASS WILL COST $54,000 A YEAR. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT, I TOLD HIM I WAS GLAD MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT CLEAN GRANT SCHOOL AT CORNELL. HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS IN THE NEW TAX BRACKET, AND HE IS PAYING MORE IN TAXES ON THE SECOND CHURCH THEM WHAT HE IS MAKING ON SECOND SHIFT. -- SECOND SHIFT THAN WHAT HE IS MAKING ON SECOND SHIFT. IF HE BUYS SOMETHING AND SELLS IT, HE TAXES THE CAPITAL GAINS. AND IF THE POOR GUY DIES FROM WORKING THAT HARD, WE WILL TAX THEM AT HIS DEATH. WE WILL GIVE HIM ANY WEEKEND. THAT IS ONE A POLLSTER FOR FOX NEWS SAID THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS MORE AFRAID OF AN AUDIT FROM THE IRS, THAN HE OR SHE IS OF GETTING MUGGED. YET, WHEN YOU GET MUGGED, IT ONLY TAKES A FEW SECONDS AND THEY CAN ONLY GET WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOU. BUT WHEN THE IRS COMES AFTER YOU, THEY WANT TO TAKE EVERY LAST DIME YOU HAVE, AND THEY WILL SPEND YEARS GETTING THERE. I HAVE A BETTER SUGGESTION. GET RID OF THE IRS. IN ALL THE TAXES ON OUR INCOME AND MOVED TO A CONSUMPTION TAX THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO PAY, INCLUDING ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPERATING IN THE MULTIBILLION- DOLLAR UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE NOT ONLY PAYING YOUR TAXES, BUT YOU ARE PAYING TAXES FOR THE DRUG DEALERS, THE PROSTITUTES AND DRUG DEALERS. THAT IS A TAX SYSTEM THAT MAKES MORE SENSE. THIS COMING TUESDAY, YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STAND, AND I HOPE YOU WILL SEND A MESSAGE TO THE REST OF AMERICA THAT THERE IS A FRESHMAN IN WIND BLOWING IN THIS COUNTRY. -- THERE IS A FRESH NEW WIND BLOWING IN THIS COUNTRY. A SYSTEM WHERE WE PAY TEACHERS WHAT THEY ARE WORTH, AND GIVE THEM THE KIND OF QUALITY SALARIES AS I DID IN MY STATE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT DO WHAT TEACHERS DO FOR FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE SHOULD RESPECT -- EXPECT RESULTS. EDUCATION OUGHT TO BE ABOUT THE STUDENT, NOT ABOUT THE SCHOOLS. IT OUGHT TO DEPERSONALIZED, JUST LIKE YOU ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. FOCUSING ON THE STUDENT, NOT WHAT HAS BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED FOR ITS INSTITUTIONS AND THE SYSTEM ITSELF. THAT MEANS PUTTING A NEW EMPHASIS ON A BROADER CURRICULUM. STIMULATE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN SO IT IS NOT JUST TO BLUNT CITED EDUCATION. KIDS ARE NOT A DATA BASE. THEY ARE FREE THINKING PEOPLE. THEY NEED THE CREATIVITY THAT COMES FROM MUSIC AND ART EDUCATIONS. WE MIGHT ACTUALLY SEE SOME STOPPING OF THIS 6000 KIDS EVERY DAY THAT QUIT SCHOOL. NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE DUMB, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE BORED. PROGRAMS LIKE KICKSTART ""KICKSTART"" THAT CHUCK NORRIS AND HIS WIFE STARTED. THESE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO TAKE A STAND AND MAKE A STATEMENT. I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA PROBABLY DO NOT THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE PUNDITS THAT SAY THAT HUCKABEE DID WELL IN IOWA, BUT HE WILL NOT DO WELL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHY NOT? I HAVE NOT LIVED HERE, AND I HAVE NOT RUN FOR OFFICE HERE BEFORE. I HAVE NOT SPENT BRAZILIAN GAZILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I PLEDGE TO YOU THAT IF YOU GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL NOT JUST REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE, I WILL REMEMBER WHERE YOU CAME FROM BECAUSE I PROBABLY CAME FROM THE SAME PLACE YOU DID. PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THEY REALLY DO WANT A PRESIDENT WHO REMINDS THEM OF THE TIME THEY WORK WITH, NOT THE GUY THAT LAID THEM OFF. QUITE FRANKLY, I UNDERSTAND STRUGGLE. LIVE, FOR ME, WAS NOT A CRYSTAL STAIR CASE. I WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY WHERE NO MAIL UPSTREAM FROM ME HAD EVER GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. MY MOTHER'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY, I AM ONE GENERATION FROM DIRT FLOORS AND OUTSIDE TOILETS. MY MOTHER HAD TO GO TO WORK EARLY TO PAY FOR THE YOUNGER ONES. MY DAD WORKED TWO JOBS. HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER FOR THE CITY OF HOPE, ARKANSAS. LIKE SO MANY AMERICANS, WHAT HE REALLY WANT, MORE THAN ANYTHING, WAS FOR HIS KIDS TO LIVE BETTER THAN HIM. MY PARENTS MADE INCREDIBLE SACRIFICES SO THAT I COULD HAVE A BETTER LIFE. SOME OF THOSE SACRIFICES, AUGUST CAME TO KNOW YEARS AFTER THEIR DEATH. THE WAYS AND THAT THEY SAID NO TO THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY COULD SAY YES TO MY SISTER AND MYSELF. BUT THEY KNEW THAT AN EDUCATION WOULD BE IMPORTANT. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOOK REVENGE OF LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY, AND RECOGNIZING WHAT A GREAT GIFT WAS TO BE AN AMERICAN. NINTH LOOK BACK, AND I REALIZE THAT THEY PREPARED FOR LIFE THAT THEY COULD NEVER IMAGINE. MY DAD NEVER THOUGHT I COULD BE THE GOVERNOR. AT 8-YEARS OLD, HE TOLD ME TO A SPEECH TO HEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT. HE SAID THAT I MIGHT LIVE MY WHOLE LIFE AND NOT MEET A GOVERNMENT IN PERSON. LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT HIS SON WOULD BECOME GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS, AND WITH THE HELP OF YOU PEOPLE ON TUESDAY, I WILL BE ON MY WAY TO BE THE 44TH PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AMERICA IS STILL A GREAT COUNTRY. CHUCK WAS PRETTY GENEROUS EARLIER, WHEN HE SAID THAT YOU GO VOTE. I HAVE A DIFFERENT. I THINK IT MATTERS A WHOLE LOT TO YOU VOTE FOR. IF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT EVER YOU CAN'T GET TO THE POLLS. IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO VOTE FOR ME, I DON'T WANT YOU GOING ANYWHERE ON TUESDAY. ORDER A PIZZA AND HAVE IT DELIVERED. AND DO NOT GO ANYWHERE. STAY HOME. I AM LOOKING FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO HELP CHANGE THIS COUNTRY. I AM LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE PART OF THE COST, NOT JUST A CAMPAIGN. -- PART OF A CAUSE, NOT JUST A CAMPAIGN. WE REALLY CAN BE INDEPENDENT OF ENERGY. WE REALLY CAN'T DO THINGS THAT MAKE US A SAFER NATION BY HAVING A STRONG DEFENSE. WE CAN BE A NATION THAT IS BETTER, BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN BE TURNED IT WRITES OUT UP -- RIGHT SIDE UP. WITH MORE EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE, I AM ASKING YOU TO GIVE ME A CHANCE. THE CHANCE TO TAKE THAT JOB AND SERVE YOU. I WILL GIVE YOU MIGHT BURY BEST EFFORT. I REALIZE NOW THAT THE GREATEST GIFT WE HAVE IN THIS MISSION IS TO GET TO BE FREE. WE OUGHT TO BE CELEBRATING IT. THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE ANYTHING IN OUR LIVES THAT TURNS US ON MORE THAN UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WOULD CUT AN ABSOLUTE FEAR EVERY DAY, WE WAKE UP IN FREEDOM. FREEDOM IS NOT ALWAYS FREE. IT, SOMEBODY SOMETHING. I HAVE A FRIEND -- IT COSTS SOMEBODY SOMETHING. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A TEACHER. SHE DECIDED TO DO AN EXPERIMENT. SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THE STUDENTS WERE JUST NOT THAT AWARE OF WHAT A SPECIAL GIFT IS TO BE AN AMERICAN. SO, OF THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL, SHE TOOK ALL OF THE SCHOOL DEATHS OF THE CLASSROOM. THE KIDS COME INTO THE CLASS AND THERE ARE NO DESKS. A WALKING IN AND ASK WHERE THE DUCKS ARE. SHE SAID THAT YOU DID NOT GET A DESK IN HER CLASSROOM UNTIL THEY TOLD HER HOW YOU EARN IT. SOME OF THEM SAID THEY HAD TO BE PAID. SHE SAID YOUR ONE TO B HAVEN MY CLASS, I PROMISE YOU, BUT THAT WILL NOT GET TO A DESK. BY NOON, ALL FOUR OF THE NETWORK TELEVISION AFFILIATES IN LITTLE ROCK THAT COME OUT THERE. THE HAD CAMERA CREWS AND WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS TEACHER WHO HAD LOST HER MIND. THE LAST PERIOD OF THE DAY, NO ONE HAD FITTED OUT. THE KIDS CAME IN AND SAT ON THE FLOOR. SHE TOLD HIM THEAT IT LOOK LIKE THAT NO ONE WAS BORN TODOOR TO FIGURE IT OUT. SHE OPENED THE DOOR, AND 24 VETERANS WALK AND CARING SCHOOL BUS. SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EARN THEIR DESK. THESE GUYS ALREADY DID. THOSE SCHOOLED ASKS THAT YOU SIT IN, THAT WE DID NOT CHARGE YOU FOR, IT COSTS SOMEBODY SOMETHING. IT COST THE FRIENDS OF SO THESE GUYS THEIR LIVES. -- OF SOME OF THESE CANSGUYS THEIR LIVES. I JUST NOT WANT TO DO THINK THAT IT DID NOT COST SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY. PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN US FREEDOM. WHEN NEED TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION THAT IF WE EVER SEND PEOPLE TO DEFEND OR ACQUIRE THAT FREEDOM OR TO PRESERVE THAT FREEDOM, WHEN THEY COME HOME, WE NEED TO REMEMBER THE JOB THAT THEY DID, AND LET NOTHING STOP US FROM MAKING SURE THAT WE HONOR THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE TO THEM. AND THAT FREEDOM COST THEM SOMETHING PRECIOUS, AND WE OWE THEM EVERYTHING FOR IT. [APPLAUSE] TUESDAY, YOU WILL GO TO VOTE. AND WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE, YOU WILL HELP CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT.

THANK YOU FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WITH US. SENATOR CLINTON HAS ARRIVED AT MANCHESTER. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> ARE YOU READY FOR AN ELECTION TOMORROW? -- ARE YOU READY FOR AN ELECTION TOMORROW? HOW ARE YOU READY TO PICK THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? IF YOU ARE READY TO CHOOSE, I AM READY TO LEAD, SO WE CAN TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACKU. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS AN AMAZING CROWD, AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN FOR THE LAST HOUR, -- [APPLAUSE] I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU ALL AND ESPECIALLY TO SEE MY DAUGHTER. >> I ACTUALLY THINK WE CAN SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS HERE TONIGHT. THERE IS SO MUCH ENERGY HOMEGROWN, MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE ENERGY, THE VERY BEST KIND. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT. I KNOW THE HOUR IS LATE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO WORK UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSE TO REACH AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE, AND I NEED YOUR HELP. [APPLAUSE] MY HUSBAND HAS JUST ARRIVED, AND I WANT TO GIVE HIM A BIG WELCOME AND INVITE HIM UP HERE. [APPLAUSE] LET ME ASK YOU -- ARE YOU READY TO PICK A PRESIDENT WHO CAN GO INTO THE OVAL OFFICE ON MONDAY WHAT AND START MAKING THE TOUGH DECISIONS THAT AMERICA NEEDS -- GO INTO THE OVAL OFFICE ON A DAY ONE AND START MAKING THE TOUGH DECISIONS THAT AMERICA NEEDS? ARE YOU READY FOR A PRESIDENT THAT WILL GO AND GET THINGS DONE IN IRAQ AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE? ARE YOU READY TO PICK A PRESIDENT WHO WILL WORK TIRELESSLY UNTIL EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN HAS QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, AND NOBODY IS LEFT OUT? HON[APPLAUSE] ARE YOU READY TO PICK A PRESIDENT WHO WILL GET THIS ECONOMY WORKING AGAIN FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO DESERVE A PRESIDENT ON THEIR SIDE? ARE YOU READY TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE EACH AND EVERY CHILD, EVERY BOY AND GIRL AS THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE AND WILL GET RID OF SNOW CHILD LEFT BEHIND? -- NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND? [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU READY TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL START REACHING OUT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AND AND THE ERA OF HON-- AND THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL? ARE YOU READY FOR A PRESIDENT THAT WILL STAND UP FOR THE OIL COMPANIES AND BEGIN TO HAVE ALL GROWN -- TO HAVE ALL GROWN UP FUEL WHERE WE PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS -- HOMEGROWN DEAL WHERE WE WILL PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK. ARE YOU READY FOR A PRESIDENT THAT WILL TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR PLANET? [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU READY TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO GETS UP EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND REMEMBERS, MADE IT POSSIBLE -- REMEMBERS WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO HAVE THE HONOR AND PLEASURE OF REPRESENTING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, BECAUSE I PROMISED THAT IF NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL BE THERE FOR ME, I WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU, EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, THIS ELECTION -- [LAUGHTER] >> THIS ELECTION IS SO SERIOUS. WE CAN GET CARRIED AWAY BY THE RALLIES, AND IT IS SO MUCH FUN TO COME OUT AND SEE ALL OF YOUR FACES AND TUESDAO SEE ALL OF THE COMMITMENT THAT EACH OF YOU BRINGS TO THIS ELECTION BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE STAKES ARE HIGH, BUT I KNOW, TOO, THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT. WE HAVE BEEN SET BACK AT A NATION. WE HAVE SEEN OUR VALUES UNDERMINED. WE HAVE SEEN OUR EYES ALIENATED AND OUR ENEMIES EMBOLDENED. -- SEEN OUR ALLIES ALIENATED AND OUR ENEMIES EMBOLDENED. MANY AMERICANS HAVE WORKED AS HARD AS THEY COULD -- THIS MORNING AT ONE OF MY EVENTS, THAT A WOMAN WHO WAS WORKING TWO JOBS. HER HUSBAND IS WORKING TWO JOBS. HOW MANY OF YOU ARE WORKING TWO JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN AMERICA? EVERYWHERE I GO I MEET PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO DO NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE. HOW MANY OF YOU DO NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE OR KNOW SOMEBODY WHO DOES IT -- WHO DOES NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE? EVERYWHERE I GO I HEAR ABOUT THE ECONOMY SHEDDING JOBS, ALWAYS BEING FORECLOSED ON, AND WE ARE A HARDWORKING PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WHAT WE HAVE NOT HAD IS A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD -- WE HAVE A GOOD JOB HERE IN AMERICA FOR THE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] SO I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR VOTE TOMORROW, IF YOU WILL TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION, I PROMISE YOU THAT WE TOGETHER WILL ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT AMERICA SHOULD BE SETTING FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN, BECAUSE WE ARE A GREAT AND GOOD NATION, AND WE HAVE GOT TO START ACTING LIKE HOW IT AGAIN. WE HAVE GOT TO BELIEVE IN OURSELVES AGAIN. WE HAVE TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK OFF AGAIN. WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE IF WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING SO. [APPLAUSE] BUT THERE ARE CHOICES IN THIS ELECTION. THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING IT, BUT WE BRING A DIFFERENT IDEA ABOUT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT AMERICA DESERVES. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL, TOGETHER, BEGAN TO SET OUR COUNTRY ON OF THE RIGHT TRACK, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT WILL TAKE. SOME PEOPLE -- [APPLAUSE] EUAN EL -YOU KNOW -- THERE IS THAT OLD SAYING, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE, ASK A BUSY WOMAN TO DO IT, BUT I BELIEVE YOU DO NOT GET PAID BY DEMANDING IT OR BY HOPING FOR IT -- YOU DO NOT GET CHANGED BY DEMANDING IT OR BY HOPING FOR IT, YOU GET IT BY WORKING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO ACHIEVE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE HAPPEN, AND I WANT TO ESPECIALLY TALK TO ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT AND UNDECIDED VOTERS WHO ARE HERE. I HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORTERS WI VERY STRONG LUNGS AND VOCAL CORDS. [APPLAUSE] BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT THE PEOPLE CAME HERE TO FINALLY MAKE UP THEIR MIND. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS DECISION, AND YOU WANT TO KNOW FROM ME WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT I WILL BE, WHAT KIND OF WORK I WILL DO FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE WILL MAKE TO THE OTHER, AND THE FIRST THING I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT ME OR ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES. WE WILL ALL BE FIRED NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. -- WE WILL ALL BE FINE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. I DID NOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I NEEDED MORE ATTENTION FROM THE PRESS OR BECAUSE I WANTED TO LIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN. I DAY 8, BUT YOU WILL ALL BE -- I DID IT -- BUT YOU WILL ALL BE INVITED WHEN WE GET BACK. [APPLAUSE] I DID EIGHT BECAUSE I CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. THIS COUNTRY HAS GIVEN ME SO MUCH, AND A LOT OF IT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH. IT WAS MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND GENERATIONS BEFORE WHO FOUGHT THE WARS, CREATED THE JOBS, DID THE HARD WORK TO BUILD AMERICA, AND AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LAND OF BUILDERS AND ARCHITECTS OF A BETTER FUTURE, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE SEE OURSELVES THAT WAY AGAIN. WE HAVE GOT TO BEGIN TO LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE OBSTACLE IN THE WAY -- EVERY CHALLENGE THAT AWAITS -- EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT CAN BE SEIZED, BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WE WILL SLOWLY BUT SURELY LOSE THE VERY ESSENCE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE BARRIERS, EXPLORE THE NEW FRONTIERS. WE ARE THE ONES YOU SENT A MAN TO THE MOON AND BROUGHT HIM BACK SAFELY AND CREATED THE INTERNET AND LITERALLY TRANSFORMED THE WORLD, AND WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN, BUT IT IS NOT ONLY GOING TO TAKE A NEW PRESIDENT -- ALTHOUGH THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE WILL INHERIT FROM GEORGE W. BUSH, AMONG MANY, IS THIS WAY HE HAS GOVERNED BY USING FEATURE. -- FEAR. HE HAS DIVIDED US. HE HAS MADE US FEEL AS THOUGH WE COULD NOT SEIZE THE FUTURE ANY LONGER. WE CANNOT HAVE IT ARREST ON HEALTH CARE WITHOUT WRECKING OF THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. -- WE CANNOT HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE WITHOUT WRECKING THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. WE CANNOT REIN IN THE OIL COMPANIES AND OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES WITHOUT UNDERMINING OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH. SINCE WHEN DID AMERICA BECOME THE CANNOT DO NATION? THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP OUR MIND AND GO AFTER WHATEVER GOALS WE SET, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. HERE IS WHY I WANT TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT. I WANT TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT SO THAT WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE BACKBONE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. IT IS THE GUARANTOR OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND TO MANY FAMILIES FEEL LIKE THEY ARE NOT GETTING AHEAD ANYMORE. THEY WATCH EVERYTHING INCREASE IN PRICE FROM HEALTH CARE TO ENERGY TO EDUCATION, AND THEY SEE THEIR INCOMES EITHER STANDING STILL OR DRINKING, AND THEY ARE ASKING THEMSELVES, BECAUSE THEY HAVE -- STANDING STILL OR SHRINKING, AND THEY ARE ASKING ME, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I AGAIN, WITH AN ECONOMIC POLICY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR THE MAJORITY AMERICANS AND NOT JUST THE WEALTHY THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY PRESIDENT BUSH. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO MOVE BACK THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE I DO NOT INTEND TO MARKET THE FEATURES OF OUR CHILDREN. WE ARE A MONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO BUY OIL FROM DAYTHE SAUDIS. WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON LEFT OF US, WE HAD A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. [LAUGHTER] -- [APPLAUSE] HERE ARE TWO WAYS WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO THAT RESPONSIBILITY. WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO HAVING PEOPLE WHO MAKE MORE THAN $250,000 A YEAR PAY THE TAX RATES THEY WERE PAYING BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES THAT TO MANY WALL STREET INVESTMENT MANAGERS HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH SO THEY PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN A TEACHER OR A SECRETARY OR NURSE OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO IS ACTUALLY WORKING EVERY DAY FOR A LIVING. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY TAX INCREASES ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX BURDEN BECAUSE YOU HAVE EARNED IT, HAVING LIVED THROUGH THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF THIS BUSH PRESIDENCY. [APPLAUSE] IN FACT, WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO GET JOBS GROWING AND GROWING AGAIN, AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS WITH A NEW ENERGY POLICY, AN ENERGY POLICY THAT PUTS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK. THERE IS NO REASON WE CANNOT DO THIS, AND I AM TALKING ABOUT GOOD JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED. JOBS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA. IF WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT ENERGY EFFICIENCY, ABOUT NEW FORMS OF FUEL FOR OUR CARS OR NEW WAYS TO ELECTRIFY ARE ALL MORE BUSINESSES, WE ARE GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE ENERGY. WE ARE GOING TO BE INNOVATORS AGAIN, AND I BELIEVE WE WILL CREATE AT LEAST 5 MILLION GREEN- POWERED JOBS IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS IF WE DO THIS RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] AND WHILE WE ARE AT IT, WE ARE GOING TO BE COMBATING GLOBAL WARMING, BECAUSE THERE ARE ALSO JOBS IN DOING THE RIGHT THING. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE GOTTEN A LEAD ON US. THEY ARE CREATING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS FOR WHY KELLY IN A MORE ENERGY-DEPENDENT -- THOUSANDS -- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS BY CREATING A MORE ENERGY- INDEPENDENT SYSTEM. I WANT US TO START EXPORTING PRODUCTS WE MAKE BEEN SET UP IMPORTING PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE TAKING HEART TECHNOLOGY -- THAT ARE TAKING OUR TECHNOLOGY AND USING IT AGAINST US. THERE IS SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE, AND I HAVE DONE THIS FOR A LONG TIME, AND I KNOW IT IS HARD, BUT I THINK I HAVE COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT WILL ACTUALLY GET IT DONE, BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE, AND YOU ARE HAPPY WITH IT, NOTHING CHANGES, BUT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE OR YOU HAVE IT AND IT DOES NOT COVER WHAT YOU NEED AT IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE, WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH PLAN. CONGRESS HAS A GOOD PLAN FOR ITSELF AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. OVER 250 OPTIONS. THE AVERAGE COST IS LESS THAN YOU CAN GET THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER OR THROUGH THE MARKET PLACE, AND WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TAX CREDIT SO YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO AFFORD IT, AND SMALL BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE, BUT IF THEY DO, THEY, TOO, WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE TAX CREDITS, BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO BURDEN SMALL BUSINESS. WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO MAKE A BETTER PROFIT AND EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE, PLUS PROVIDE HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE HEALTH CARE POLICIES COVER WHAT THEY SHOULD. THEY SHOULD COVER PREVENTION. THEY SHOULD COVER MENTAL HEALTH. I HEAR THAT ALL OVER THE STATE. I JUST LEFT A RALLY IN SALEM, AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, PLEASE, MAKE SURE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE MENTAL HEALTH. I JUST LOST MY SON. I HEAR THAT ALL OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE HAVE GOT TO END THE STIGMA OF MENTAL HEALTH AND PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO START DOING MORE RESEARCH INTO WHAT CAUSES DISEASE AND HOW TO CURE IT. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO RAISE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH CARE AND BUDGET AND -- INTO PUTTING MONEY INTO FINDING CAUSES AND CURES FOR DISEASES FROM CANCER TO AUTISM, FROM ALZHEIMER'S TO DIABETES. WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE DISEASES, AND WE ARE GOING TO DO IT BY MAKING SMART INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING STEM CELL RESEARCH, WHICH INCLUDES SO MUCH PROGRESS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS -- I AM PROPOSING A PLAN THAT LEAVES NO ONE OUT. I COULD NOT LIVE WITH MYSELF IF I INTRODUCED A PLAN THAT WOULD LEAVE PEOPLE OUT. WHO WOULD I LEAVE OUT? I HAVE MET SO MANY PEOPLE YEAR -- I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE IS IN THE AUDIENCE, BUT BARBARA HAS BECOME A FRIEND OF MINE. THERE SHE IS, AND I MET BARBARA AFTER A RALLY LIKE THIS, AND I WAS SHAKING HANDS AS ALL OF US DO AFTER BIG EVENT LIKE THIS, AND I TRY WHEN I SHAKE PEOPLE'S HANDS DO THE PEOPLE IN THE EYE. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT -- I TRY WHEN I SHAKE PEOPLE'S HANDS TO LOOK THE PEOPLE IN THE EYE. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT I SEE THEM. AND SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HER SON, HER SON WHO WAS BORN WITH A HEART CONDITION, HAS HAD FOUR SURGERIES, AND IS STILL WITH US. A WONDERFUL YOUNG BOY WHO IS NOW DOING WELL AND GOING TO SCHOOL, BUT SHE SAID TO ME, I WANT TO THANK YOU. AND I SAID, WHAT FOR? SHE SAID, FOR THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, BECAUSE IT WAS A PROGRAM I HELPED START 10 YEARS AGO, AND NOW 7000 CHILDREN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HAVE HEALTH CARE SO THEY CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF BY BARBARA'S SON. THOUGH I AM GOING TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH CARE THAT COVERS EVERYBODY -- SO I AM GOING TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH CARE THAT COVERS EVERYBODY. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] EDUCATION IS STILL THE PASSPORT TO OPPORTUNITY, AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM PREPARES ALL OF OUR CHILDREN FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. I WANT TO START BY MAKING SURE THAT THE PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM ARE AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN WHO ARE 4 YEARS OLD SO THEY CAN BEGIN TO GO TO SCHOOL, AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE START WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN SETTING OUR TEACHERS AGAINST OUR FAMILIES, OF SETTING OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS AGAINST OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AMERICA HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL. I WANT TO WORK WITH THEM, AND I WILL END NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, BECAUSE IT HAS NOT WORKED. [APPLAUSE] AND LET US BE SURE THAT WE MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS LAST FOUR DAYS. IT IS A NUMBER ONE CONCERN THEY RAISE WITH ME, BECAUSE I HAVE MET TO MANY FAMILIES ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT. I MET A WOMAN WHO TOLD ME THEY MIGHT HAVE TO SELL THEIR HOUSE TO SEND THEIR DAUGHTER TO COLLEGE BECAUSE HER HUSBAND WORKS, BUT SHE IS DISABLED AND THEY DO NOT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO SAVE LIVES, SO WE ARE GOING TO -- DO NOT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THIS, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT SO THAT YOU CAN EARN MONEY BY DOING SERVICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE. [APPLAUSE] AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO END THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY'S HALL OF SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FUTURES -- HOLD OF SO MANY OF PEOPLE AND THEIR FUTURES, BECAUSE IT IS WRONG. AND I WILL ALSO ADD THAT LONG FINANCIAL AID FORM THAT YOU FILL OUT AND DO NOT GET ANYTHING FROM IT. [APPLAUSE] I ALSO WANT US TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE. WE HAVE A LOT OF HARD-WORKING, WONDERFUL YOUNG AMERICANS THAT DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE, I DO NOT GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. LET US START RESPECTING THEM MORE. LET US START GIVING THEM MORE APPRENTICESHIPS PROGRAMS. EVERY FIFTH OF PERSON IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CHANCE AT A GOOD FUTURE -- EVERY DAY ON A PERSON IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CHANCE FOR A GOOD FUTURE -- EVERY YOUNG PERS INON AMERICA SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CHANCE FOR A GOOD FUTURE. AND WE ARE GOING TO ADD ON TOP OF SOCIAL SECURITY SOMETHING CALLED THE AMERICAN RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE START SAVING, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW MOST PEOPLE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO MARGIN TO FALL BACK ON, SO WE ARE GOING TO MATCH THE FIRST $60,000 THAT YOU MAKE -- WE WILL MATCH THE FIRST $60,000 YOU SAVE BECAUSE WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE SAVINGS, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE MORE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AVAILABLE. IT SHOULD NOT JUST BEFORE SOME EMPLOYEES OR EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES, AND WE WILL TAX THE LONGTERM CHALLENGES OF SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT WE WILL NOT DO IT ON THE BACK OF MIDDLE- CLASS FAMILIES. [APPLAUSE] I WILL NOT SUPPORT -- OF LIKE MY OPPONENTS, I WILL NOT SUPPORT RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX SO IT BECOMES A HUGE TRILLION DOLLAR TAX INCREASE. WHAT WE WHEAT -- WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL SECURITY IS TO GET BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. THAT WILL REPLENISH THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND, AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, AND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE. WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE, THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO WHEN WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL SECURITY, WHEN WE TACKLE THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND, BECAUSE ALL OF THESE ISSUES -- AND I KNOW THERE ARE THOSE THAT ACT AS THOUGH WE CAN JUST MAKE WASHINGTON DISAPPEAR. WHEN THEY ARRIVE THEY WILL JUST ORDER EVERYBODY TO ACT RIGHT AND BE NICE. I DO NOT THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE THE REACTION. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE WILLING TO DIG IN AND FIGHT HARD TO MAKE THE CHANGES WE NEED. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT EFFORT, BUT I HAVE PROVEN THAT I CAN AND DO WORK ACROSS THE PARTY LINES, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS ELECTED -- THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TOOK A CHANCE ON ME, AND THEY SENT ME TO THE SENATE. THERE WERE THOSE WHO SAID, SHE WILL NEVER WORK WITH REPUBLICANS, AND REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER WORK WITH HER, BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW ME AND THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE. I BELIEVE WHEN PEOPLE GIVE YOU THEIR VOTES YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE BEST RESULTS YOU CAN. . >> BECAUSE I THINK WORKING ACROSS PARTY LINES IS WHAT IS NECESSARY TO FIND COMMON GROUND. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED MORE OF IN AMERICA. WE NEED TO MEET EACH OTHER, HEAR EACH OTHER. WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW TO STAND OUR GROUND. AND I THINK I HAVE PROVEN THAT I KNOW HOW TO DO BOTH, AND I WILL TAKE THAT EXPERIENCE RIGHT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. BECAUSE I THINK IT TAKES STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO MAKE THE CHANGES WE NEED IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL -- WE WILL REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GOING TO REFORM IT TO MAKE IT MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCESSIBLE AND COMPETENT AND SENSITIVE. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK AGAIN BECAUSE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS IT'S BEEN TURNED INTO A GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW, BY THE FEW, AND FOR THE FEW. AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT IT IS MEANT TO BE. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A RADICAL, OLD FASHIONED IDEA. HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE POSITIONS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN THE GOVERNMENT AGAIN? [APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE GOING -- WE'RE GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON THE NO BIG CONTRACTS AND CRONYISM. WE'RE GOING TO WORK FOR PUBLIC FINANCING. WE'RE GOING TO GET THE GOVERNMENT INTO THE 21ST CENTURY TO MAKE IT MORE COST EFFECTIVE. NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO SEE A GOVERNMENT WASTE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, SEE THESE NO BID CONTRACTS NOBODY CAN EXPLAIN OR HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. I WANT TO PUT EVERYTHING ON THE INTERNET. I WANT YOU TO SEE THE BUDGET OF EVERY AGENCY. I WANT YOU TO TRACK EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN YOUR GOVERNMENT. YOU PAY FOR IT. YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD EVEN HAVE A GOVERNMENT BLOGGING TEAM WHERE PEOPLE IN AGENCIES ARE CONSTANTLY TELLING ALL OF YOU, THE TAXPAYERS, THE CITIZENS OF AMERICA, EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON SO THAT YOU HAVE UP TO THE MINUTE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOUR GOVERNMENT IS DOING SO THAT YOU, TOO, CAN BE INFORMED AND HOLD THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVE TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD. AND THAT BEGINS BY ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME. [APPLAUSE] AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO ON THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT I BECOME PRESIDENT. I'M GOING TO ASK THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND THE SECURITY ADVISE SORS, TO GIVE ME A PLAN TO BEGIN WITHDRAWING TROOPS WITHIN 60 DAYS. SOME MIGHT SAY, WHY DO YOU NEED A PLAN? THE ANSWER IS UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE HAS PLANNED. I GOT WORRIED ABOUT THIS LAST SPRING, AND I WROTE TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SAYING I WANT A BRIEFING ABOUT THE PLAN TO WITHDRAW THE TROOPS. THEY WROTE BACK AND SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU. AND I SAID, YES, YOU ARE. SO WE HAD A BRIEFING, AND IT WAS CLASSIFIED SO I CAN'T TELL YOU THE DETAILS, BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT IT WASN'T VERY DETAILED. AND, YOU KNOW, ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE MILITARY KNOW WITHDRAWING TROOPS IS DANGEROUS. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR CONVOYS ALL THE WAY OUT, WHETHER WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE NORTH OR SOUTH. WE HAVE TO GET ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT OUT. WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE A LOT OF VALUABLE, LETHAL EQUIPMENT BEHIND. I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT DO WE DO FOR OUR AMERICAN CIVILIANS WORKING FOR EMBASSY, BUSINESSES, CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS, AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE IRAQIS WHO SIDED WITH US? YOU KNOW, I WENT TO FALLUJAH IN 2005 WITH JOHN MCCAIN. HE AND I HAVE DONE SOME TRAVELING TOGETHER. AND WHAT HAPPENS ON THE ROAD STAYS ON THE ROAD. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE WENT IN TO FALLUJAH SHORTLY AFTER THE MARINES HAD TAKEN IT BACK. AND I TALKED TO SO MANY OF THE MARINES WHO WERE THERE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND BLOODY BATTLE. AND I KNOW ONE YOUNG MARINE CAPTAIN PRETTY WELL. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I NEVER WOULD HAVE SURVIVED, MY MEN WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR OUR IRAQI TRANSLATOR. NOW, THEY KNOW HE IS A MARINE TRANSLATER AND HE AND HIS FAMILY ARE TARGETED. SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN AN HONORABLE WAY WHO TOOK CARE OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN IRAQ WHEN THEY WERE IN HARM'S WAY. [APPLAUSE] AND THEN, I THINK WE CAN BRING HOME ONE TO TWO BRIGADES A MONTH. THAT'S WHAT THE MILITARY ADVISE SORS I HAVE TALKED TO HAVE SAID. AND WE WILL BRING THEM HOME. AND WHEN WE BRING THEM HOME, LET'S TAKE CARE OF THEM. LET'S GIVE THEM -- [APPLAUSE] LET'S GIVE THEM THE HEALTHCARE THAT THEY NEED. LET'S GIVE THEM THE SUPPORT, THE COMPENSATION THAT THEY HAVE EARNED. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU I THOUGHT I WAS BEYOND BEING OUTRAGED BY GEORGE BUSH OR DICK CHENEY. I MEAN, DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THEIR ADMINISTRATION I USED TO YELL AT THE TELEVISION SET. I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP. THE VICE PRESIDENT SHOOTS SOMEBODY. I MEAN, AND THEN A FEW MONTHS AGO IT HAPPENED TO ME. WHEN I HEARD THAT THE PENTAGON WAS TRYING TO TAKE BACK THE SIGNING BONUSES GIVEN TO YOUNG AMERICANS WHO ENLISTED IN THE MILITARY, IT WAS BEYOND SHAMEFUL. AND SO I TEAMED UP WITH ANOTHER REPUBLICAN SENATOR. THIS TIME FROM ALABAMA. AND I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU WE PASSED A LAW PROHIBITING THE PENTAGON FROM VIOLATING OUR DECENCY, OUR VALUES, HURTING OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN WOUNDED. [APPLAUSE] I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS PRESIDENT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF OUR VETERANS. I THINK IF SOMEBODY HAS SERVED OUR COUNTRY, WE INCUR AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE THEM IN RETURN. AND WE WILL GIVE A NEW 21ST CENTURY G.I. BILL OF RIGHTS TO OUR YOUNG VETERANS COMING BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS BACK TO THOSE WHO ARE STILL WITH US FROM WORLD WAR II, AND I WANT TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION FROM THE VETERANS FROM MY GENERATION WHO SERVED AND FOUGHT IN VIETNAM WHO NEVER GOT THE SUPPORT, RESPECT, SERVICES THEY DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT FOR ME, IT CAN BE SUMMED UP BY SAYING WE WANT TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. SEE, I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THE FIRST GENERATION TO BREAK FAITH WITH THE PURPOSE OF AMERICA. PURPOSE OF AMERICA IS PROGRESS, BETTERMENT, GIVING PEOPLE A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR OWN DREAMS. OH, SURE, WE DISAGREE ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS. ONE THING THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT ABOUT IS THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM HAS TO REMAIN REAL. IT HAS TO BE ACHIEVEABLE. EVERYBODY HAS TO FEEL THEY HAVE A CHANCE. WE CAN'T GET THE DECK STACKED AGAINST HARD WORKING, MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE BELIEVE IN OUR PURPOSE AND IN FULFILLING IT BY WORKING IN THESE GOALS TOGETHER. SO I'M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. I BELIEVE THAT THIS ELECTION IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD AS I CAN BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME THE POLLS CLOSE TOMORROW TO REACH AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE. [APPLAUSE] AND I ASK YOU -- I ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS, AND I ASK YOU TO TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS, TALK TO YOUR FAMILIES ABOUT WHAT'S AT STAKE BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE HIGH. THE JOB IS HUGE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO TURN OUR COUNTRY AROUND, BUT I AM CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC WE CAN DO THIS. I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO THIS. WE, TOGETHER, CAN DO THIS. IF WE START ACTING LIKE AMERICANS AGAIN. AND AS I LOOK TOWARD OUR FUTURE, I SEE WHAT CAN BE. WE CAN REGAIN RESPECT AROUND THE WORLD. WE CAN ONCE AGAIN FEEL PROUD OF OUR NATION. WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING THESE GOALS THAT WILL LITERALLY TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, AND WE CAN -- YES, WE CAN -- MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH.

WHAT THIS IS REGULAR BURGER, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE BUFFALO VERSION. IT IS A WHOLE WHEAT BUN WITH SPINACH. THIS COULD BE, ANYONE WHO IS THIS WILL LOSE WEIGHT, WILL VOTE FOR MIKE HUCKABEE, AND WILL LIVE FOREVER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN. THIS WILL BE AN INTERNATIONAL TASTE SENSATION. >> HE CAN PUT IT DOWN RIGHT THERE. >> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M GOING TO PUT IT DOWN. DON'T YOU ENJOY WATCHING US EAT? >> IT IS ON A WHOLE GRAIN BUN. AND THAT MAKES IT PERFECTLY OK. GOOD LEAN BEEF, WITH SPINACH AND TOMATO. IT IS KIND OF LIKE A SALAD WITH SOME VERY HEALTHY BREAD. THIS IS A NEW HAMPSHIRE THING OUT. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. THIS IS NOT A WORD. THIS IS NO HEAVY LIFTING. IT IS NOT BAD. THE PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF THAT I AM NOT IN THE DEEP SOUTH BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENTS. THE HOSPITALITY IS THE SAME AS WE WOULD EVER EXPERIENCED. I HAVE REALLY BEEN IMPRESSED EVER WE HAVE BEEN. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN NICE AND KIND. PEOPLE TAKE THEIR POLITICS SERIOUSLY, BUT THEY TAKE BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS SERIOUSLY, TOO. I AM TRULY THRILLED THAT WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED SO WELL. I CAME HERE THIS SUMMER, AND EVERYBODY WITHIN COULD SIT AT ONE TABLE AND WE HAVE ROOM FOR GUESTS. NO DOUBT THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MOMENTUM GOING. WE HAVE SINCE IT OVER THE PAST TWO AND THAT ONE HALF MONTHS. -- THE PAST TWO AND ONE-HALF MONTHS. WE CAME OUT OF IOWA WITH A STRONG LINK TO OUR BACKS. THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, EVERYWHERE WE HAVE BEEN, WE HAVE OVERFLOW OF THE VENUES. IT IS UNDER BEDLAM. THAT IS GOOD. WE COULD NOT ASK FOR MORE. PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE HAVE BEEN HOSPITABLE ENTHUSIASTIC. THAT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR US. THEY EVEN MAKE SPECIAL BIRDERS. AFTER I HAVE SERVED BY A SECOND TERM AS PRESIDENT, THIS MURDER WILL BE THE SIGNATURE ITEM.

SHE IS ANNOUNCES ITS $70 BILLION STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT WOULD INCLUDE ENERGY AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS TAX REBATES. THIS IS ABOUT AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] >> IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE, BACK IN SUNNY CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA, THE STATE OF THE CALIFORNIAN DREAM. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE AT IBW. BEFORE I BEGIN, I WOULD LIKE TO CALL UP OUR FRIENDS WHO ARE ALL HERE TO CELEBRATE AND SUPPORT. PLEASE HELP ME IN WELCOMING CHELSEA CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] LT. GOV. JOHN GARAMENDI. [APPLAUSE] AND THE GREAT SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY. HILARY. HILARY. HILLARY. HELP ME IN WELCOMING AS WELL BE GREAT CONGRESS MEMBER REPRESENTING THIS DISTRICT, MY FRIEND, MY SISTER, LUCILLE MAURER BALL ALLARD. [APPLAUSE] I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF. LET ME SAY FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE IBEW. [APPLAUSE] YEAR LATER, MY FRIEND, MY BROTHER -- YOUR LEADER. [APPLAUSE] OVER THE YEARS, THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY HAVE ALL COME TOGETHER AROUND THE IDEA THAT IN AN AMERICA THAT IS TOO RELIANT ON FOREIGN OIL, WE NEED TO BEGIN TO INVEST IN IT AND DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AT THE SAME TIME, WE NEED TO CREATE A GREENIE ECONOMY, A GOOD ECONOMY, ONE THAT RAISES THE WAGES OF WORKING PEOPLE. THE IBEW UNDERSTANDS THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE, AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU IN YOUR LEADERSHIP, THIS TRAINING CENTER, WHICH IS A STATE OF THE ART TRAINING CENTER AROUND THE NATION. [APPLAUSE] I SAID IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE SUNNY STATE, IN THE GOLDEN STATE. AS YOU KNOW, I WAS IN IOWA THREE TIMES IN DECEMBER. IT WAS COLD -- VERY COLD. FROM THERE, AND I WENT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR FIVE DAYS. [APPLAUSE] WHEN PEOPLE ASK IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WHY I WOULD LEAVE SUNNY CALIFORNIA IN THE DEAD OF WINTER FOR IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, I SAID, ""IT IS SIMPLE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN MY LIFETIME. [APPLAUSE] AND I'M HERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU AGREE IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN YOUR LIFETIME AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] I SAID THAT THIS IS THE DEEPEST AND MOST TALENTED FIELD OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES THAT I CAN REMEMBER FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN VOTING. I STARTED VOTING IN 1972 IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. I SAID THAT AMERICA WOULD BE BLESSED TO HAVE ANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS A LEADER, AND YET, AFTER LOOKING AT ALL OF THE CANDIDATES, I SAID I'M HERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE TOUGH AND PERILOUS TIMES IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL GET US OUT OF THAT WAR AS QUICKLY AND SAFELY AS POSSIBLE. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT THAT DOES NOT JUST TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE. A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE FOR A GENERATION. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM AN OVER DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL CREATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW JOBS FOR THE FUTURE. [APPLAUSE] AND SO I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH THE OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE HERE TODAY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE ASK HOW CALIFORNIA IS GOING, HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE, WE ARE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT WE NEED A CHANGE IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, THAT WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING, AND THAT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON IS THE WOMAN -- [APPLAUSE] WHO, ON THE FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, WILL GET US THERE. [APPLAUSE] AND NOW, IT IS MY HONOR -- AND MY HONOR AND MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE A MAN THAT NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HE HAS SERVED IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND A SENATOR, AS AN APPOINTEE IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. HE KNOWS BETTER THAN ANYONE JUST WHY WE NEED HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT NOW. PLEASE HELP ME IN WELCOMING THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, MY FRIEND, JOHN GARAMENDI. [APPLAUSE] >> MAYOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR -- NOT THE INTRODUCTION, BUT FOR SETTING THE STAGE FOR WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON BECOMES THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] MARVIN, IT IS GOOD TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF LABOR. IT IS GOOD TO BE IN YOUR HOUSE, AND IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING ON TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF GREEN TECH WORKERS THAT WILL TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU JUST A VERY FEW MOMENTS WHY I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT THE CENTER BECOMES THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THESE ARE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE PERSONAL TO ME AND TO MY WIFE. FIRST OF ALL, I KNOW THAT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON UNDERSTANDS WORKING WOMEN AND FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] PATTI AND I WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE OF JANUARY 1993, SHORTLY AFTER 2 -- PRESIDENT CLINTON BECAME PRESIDENT. AT THAT BREAKFAST, THE DISCUSSION CENTERED AROUND THIS OUTSTANDING YOUNG WOMAN, CHELSEA, AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A SLEEK BEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE OR A SLEEPING AT SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME. -- A SLEEP-IN AT THE WHITE HOUSE OR A SLEEP-IN AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE SENATOR SAID SHE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE THERE BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT MET ALL THE PARENTS. THAT IS WHAT EVERY PARENT UNDERSTAND. SECONDLY AND ON THE SAME POINT, SHE DID A TERRIFIC JOB RAISING THIS YOUNG LADY. [APPLAUSE] SECOND POINT -- THERE IS NO ELECTED LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES THAT UNDERSTANDS MORE ABOUT THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE THAN SENATOR CLINTON. WE NEED A PRESIDENT -- [APPLAUSE] I WAS THERE WORKING WITH SENATOR CLINTON WHEN THOSE TOUGH DAYS WERE BEFORE US IN THE EARLY 1990'S. . >> THE FUTURE IS DEPENDENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THIS SENATOR UNDERSTANDS THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THAT. THOSE WHEN MACHINES AND THOSE SOLAR PANELS, SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT. [APPLAUSE] IN BRINGING BACK TO AMERICA IN THE HIGH-PAYING JOBS THAT THE IBEW LOCAL 11 WILL BE CONDUCTING AS WE TRANSITION TO A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM HERE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND MY FOURTH POINT IS THIS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT IS NOT ONLY EXPERIENCED IN THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF THIS NATION, BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT FACE THE REST OF THE WORLD. THERE IS NO OTHER CANDIDATE THAT HAS TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD, REPRESENTING AMERICA AND AMERICANS, CONTACTING AND WORKING WITH LEADERS AND INTERESTED PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT HAS ALL KINDS OF STAMPS ON THEIR PASSPORT AND UNDERSTANDS THE NEEDS OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. THIS CENTER WILL BE THE PRESIDENT THAT HAS THAT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE WE DO LIVE ON THIS GLOBE, NOT ALONE, BUT TOGETHER WITH OTHERS. IT IS IMPORTANT. [APPLAUSE] THIS RACE IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. THIS RACE IS ABOUT CHANGE. EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THAT. WE TALK ABOUT THAT EVERY FOUR YEARS. THIS RACE IS ALSO ABOUT SOMEONE WHO COULD GET THE JOB DONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THIS IS THE PERSON THAT CAN DO IT. SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, GO FOR IT, HELP OUR NATION. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED TO BE HERE. I SAY ALL THE TIME THAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. I THOUGHT I WOULD COME TO WHERE THE FUTURE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK MARTIN FOR NOT ONLY WELCOMING US HERE, BUT FOR GIVING ME A FEW MINUTES WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE TRAINING TO CREATE THESE NEW JOBS OF THE FUTURE. I AM SO EXCITED THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE CAN BE A MODEL FOR WHAT WE MUST DO AROUND AMERICA. THANK USE, SO MUCH, MARTIN. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK MY FRIENDS WHO ARE HERE WITH ME. I APPRECIATE THE STRONG STATEMENT OF ENDORSEMENTS FROM JOHN GARAMENDI. I AM AMAZED AT ALL THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE IN A BIPARTISAN WAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO SETTLE -- TO SET THE FUTURE IN MOTION. [APPLAUSE] AND I APPRECIATE MY FRIEND AND SISTER, YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN, WHO HAS BEEN A STALWART CHAMPION. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. THAT WE TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO GET UP EVERY DAY AND BE THE VERY BEST THAT THEY CAN. LUCILLE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND I WAS SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE MAYOR'S HELPED DURING OUR TIMES IN THE COLD IN THE SNOW. EVERY TIME I SAW HIM, HE WAS ON FIRE. HE NEEDED TO BE BECAUSE HE WAS SHIVERING HAVE THE TIME. HE GOT OUT THERE AND HE MADE THE CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY. IT IS REALLY A CASE FOR ALL OF US. AS THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES, HE NEEDS A PRESIDENT THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE THAT ALLLOSS ANGELES REMAINS A GREAT CITY CARRIED. I CAME HERE TODAY TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I WANTED TO ASSURE PRESIDENT. TO ME, RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS NOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING. THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE, DON'T YOU? YOU SEE IT ON THE INTERNET AND YOU HEAR IT ON THE RADIO. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT YOUR FAMILY IS, YOUR FUTURES, IT IS ABOUT YOUR JOBS, YOUR HEALTH CARE, YOUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. IT IS ABOUT YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS THAT SERVE OUR COUNTRY FAR AWAY FROM HOME. IT IS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I AM GOING TO GIVE THIS ELECTION BACK TO YOU. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE ALWAYS, IN 35 YEARS OF WORKING ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WOMEN CA, WHEN, AND OTHERS. I HAVE HEARD THE VOICES DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, AND IT MAKES ME BOTH HUMBLE AND MORE DETERMINED AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] I WAS IN LAS VEGAS YESTERDAY, GOING DOOR TO DOOR. I MET WONDERFUL ARE WORKING FAMILIES. I ALSO MET CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN LAID OFF. I'M MET WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE. I MET FAMILIES WHO ASKED ME HOW THEY WERE EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY THEIR CHILDREN'S COLLEGE TUITION. I HEAR ALL OF THE VOICES OF AMERICA. ONE PARTICULAR QUESTION THAT I HEAR A LOT OF TODAY IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE ECONOMY. WHERE ARE WE? THIS ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR EVERYBODY. PART OF WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE SIGNED IS -- GOT TO DECIDE, SOME SAYING THE ECONOMY IS GOING THERE. SOME SAY NOT YET. THE STATISTICS ARE ONE THING. THE STORIES ARE SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT. IF YOU HAVE LOST YOUR JOB BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION HAS SLOWED DOWN, YOU DO NOT CARE WHAT THE ECONOMISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT IS WHO IS GOING TO HELP YOU. I GET UP AND I TRY TO WORK AND THERE IS NOT WORK THERE. IF YOU HAVE LOST YOUR HEALTH CARE, BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANY REFUSES TO PAY FOR THE PROBLEM THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE, OR THEY WILL NOT EVEN GIVE IT TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE, OR EMPLOYER NO LONGER PROVIDES IT, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON IS TALKING ABOUT. WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB, AND EVERYWHERE THAT YOU GO, YOU ARE TOLD THAT THOSE JOBS ARE NO LONGER PLENTIFUL IN CALIFORNIA OR AMERICA BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL BEEN SHIPPED OVERSEAS, IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT YOU ARE TOLD, IT IS WHAT YOU FEEL. IT IS HOW YOU FEEL DEEP DOWN. MAYBE THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. EVERYONE OF US WHO WAS JUST ON THE STAGE IS A PRODUCT OF THAT AMERICAN DREAM. EVERYONE OF US WORK OUR WAY INTO THE POSITIONS WE ARE. NOBODY HANDED US A THE KIND OF SILVER PLATTER. SOME OF THE SPUR OF BARRIERS TO GET THERE. SO, WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WORKING HARD. WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO REWARD THAT HARD WORK. THE WAY THAT AMERICA HAS ALWAYS WORKED IS THAT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, YOU WILL GET AHEAD. YOUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES THAN YOU HAVE HAD. AND YOU CAN LOOK BACK AT YOUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS, AND KNOW WHAT PRYDE THEY MUST FILL BECAUSE OF THE PROGRESS THAT YOU AND AMERICA HAVE MADE TOGETHER. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PURPOSE OF AMERICA, WHICH IS THAT PROGRESS AND NOT PRYDE, CONTINUES FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL THERE AND EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] LONG BEFORE YOU HEARD FOLKS TALKING ABOUT SLIDING INTERES INTO A RECESSION, I SAW IT AND I FELT IT. I SAW HARD-WORKING PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND THEY BEGAN TO THINK AND NOBODY EVEN SEES THEM ANYMORE. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT, WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT, THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. IT IS ALMOST LIKE WE ARE INVISIBLE, PEOPLE TOLD ME. WELL, THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT I GREW UP IN. THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT I WANT TO BE THERE FOR OUR FUTURE SO, THERE WILL BE NO INVISIBLE AMERICANS WHEN I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. CROWD: HILLARY, HILLARY,. >> FOR ME, POLITICS IS NOT A GAME. IT IS SERIOUS BUSINESS ABOUT OUR FUTURE. IT IS ABOUT HELPING EVERYONE GET THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DREAMS, YOUR FUTURE. WHEN I SEE A PROBLEM, I KNOW THAT AMERICA IS UP TO MEETING IT IF WE HAVE LEADERS UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO BE UNITED AND TRY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. IN ORDER TO FACE THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING THAT AMERICA CANNOT DO IF WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO DO IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE COMMON PURPOSE OF AMERICA, AND THAT WILL BE THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESIDENCY. TO LISTEN TO YOU AND YOUR VOICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND DELIVER RESULTS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] SO, HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE. WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT, DESPITE THE HAPPY TALK FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE REPUBLICANS, IS NOT WORKING. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAS LOST $1,000 IN INCOME OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS HAVE DOUBLED. ENERGY COSTS HAVE GONE UP $2,000 SINCE GEORGE BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT. PEOPLE TRY TO ACT LIKE A FAX TO NOT MATTER. FACTS GET IN THE WAY OF SOARING RHETORIC OR POLITICAL COMBAT. A BUT FACTS ARE STUBBORN. YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE TALK FROM PRESIDENT BUSH ABOUT TAX CUTS. IF YOU ARE WEALTHY AND WELL- CONNECTED, THAT TALK WAS TURNED INTO ACTION. BUT IF YOU WERE A MIDDLE-CLASS WORKING FAMILY, WHATEVER TAX CUT YOU GOT FROM GEORGE BUSH, YOUR ENERGY COSTS WENT UP THREE TIMES MORE. SO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON A LOT OF THESE TOUGH ISSUES UNTIL WE REALIZE THAT WE HAVE TO GET THE TO OIL MEN OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AND BEGAN TO CHANGE DIRECTION. [APPLAUSE] CROWD: HILLARY, HILLARY, HILLARY, HILLARY, HILLARY. >> I HAVE LAID OUT A LONG-TERM STRATEGY ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO STABILIZE AND GROW THE ECONOMY. I WANT TO GET BACK WHERE WE SEE MILLIONS OF JOBS CREATED IN AMERICA. I KNOW WE CAN DO THAT. BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT WE CAN WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 20 OF NEXT YEAR. TOO MANY JOBS WILL BE LOST. TOO MANY HOMES WILL BE FORECLOSED ON. TOO MANY PEOPLE WILL GO WITHOUT HEALTH CARE. WE CANNOT WAIT. THAT IS WHY I AM CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SOME QUICK ACTION TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT THIS SLIDE TOWARD RECESSION. UNLIKE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN, WHICH FOCUSED ON TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, MY PLAN FOCUSES ON HARD-WORKING FAMILIES THAT NEED THE HELP RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] NOW, HERE IS WHAT I WILL DO TOMORROW, IF I COULD. FIRST, I AM PROPOSING A $30 BILLION FUND TO HELP HARD-HIT COMMUNITIES AND DISTRESSED HOMEOWNERS WHETHER THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS. RIGHT HERE, IN CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE 95,000 HOMES IN FORECLOSURES RIGHT NOW. YESTERDAY, IN NEVADA, NEVADA HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF HOME FORECLOSURES IN AMERICA. I SAT DOWN AT A RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS TALKING TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HOMES. YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS, WHEN IT COMES TO FORECLOSURE, CANNOT STAY IN VEGAS. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THIS FUND WOULD GIVE STATES AND COMMUNITIES, THE MAYOR, THE SPEAKER, THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, IT WOULD DO YOU RESOURCES TO PROVIDE AT RISK FAMILIES WITH DESPERATELY NEEDED SERVICES, LIKE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND HELP REFINANCING THESE ON AFFORDABLE LOANS -- THESE UNAFFORDABLE LOANS. EVERYTHING FROM MAINTAINING VACANT PROPERTIES TO SERVICES LIKE COMMUNITY POLICING. SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS MORTGAGE CRISIS IN A VERY NARROW WAY. CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE AT RISK FOR LOSING THEIR HOMES ARE ALREADY HAVE. IF YOU HAVE HOME FORECLOSURES IN A NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU ARE LIKELY, IN THIS HOUSING MARKET, TO HAVE VACANT PROPERTIES. WHEN YOU HAVE VACANT PROPERTIES, YOU ATTRACT PEOPLE THAT YOU DO NOT WANT BEING YOUR KIDS. YOU BEGIN TO HAVE LOWER PROPERTY TAX REVENUES, SO SERVICES GET CUT BACK WHICH MAKES THE PROBLEM EVEN WORSE. I WANT US TO START UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERY PROBLEM WE FACE IN AMERICA, WE ARE IN IT TOGETHER. IT IS NOT US VERSUS THEM, IT IS ALL OF US TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS, AND I BELIEVE WE CAN START BY FOCUSING ON THIS. SECOND, I AM CALLING FOR COMPREHENSIVE ACTION TO END THE HOUSING PROBLEM. HERE IS WHAT I WOULD DO. I AM CALLING FOR A 90 DAY MORATORIUM ON FORECLOSURES. NO FORECLOSURES FOR THREE MONTHS SO IF THE BANK IS ABOUT TO FORECLOSE ON YOUR OWN, YOU WOULD HAVE SOME BREATHING WENT TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR MORTGAGE COULD HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR HAD STARTING LAST MARCH, I HAVE SAID THAT WE HAVE HAD PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO PUT HOMEOWNERS INTO MORTGAGES THEY COULD NOT AFFORD BECAUSE THEY GOT MORE MONEY FOR HAVING A HIGHER INTEREST RATE MORTGAGE. YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY WHO COULD PAY A GOOD INTEREST RATE ON A MORTGAGE WHO WERE PUSHED INTO ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES. ONCE THEY GO UP, THEY ARE BEYOND SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR. WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT COULD STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND PAY THE MORTGAGE THAT ARE PAYING. BUT A LOT OF PRESSURE IS COMING FROM THE INVESTORS THAT BOUGHT THESE MORTGAGES. IT IS NOT YOUR LOCAL BANK OR THE FELLOW WHO SOLD IT TO YOU WHO IS NOW HOLDING THE MORTGAGE, IT IS SOMEBODY SITTING IN SHANGHAI OR IN DUBAI OR IN BERLIN ARE AND LONDON OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET AN INTEREST RATE RETURN, AND IF YOU STOP ME FROM GETTING THAT, THEN I AM I GETTING THE RETURN ON MY INVESTMENT. THAT IS WHY I WENT TO WALL STREET LAST MONTH. I REPRESENT WALL STREET, AND I AM PROUD TO DO THAT. THEY GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES. ON THIS ISSUE, WALL STREET IS COMPLICITOUS. WITH THE BANKS AND THE LENDERS AND EVERYBODY WHO TOOK HIS VANTAGE OF AMERICANS [APPLAUSE] IF WE CAN GET A MORATORIUM, WHICH CAN HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE HOMES. YOU WANT TO JUMP HOUSE PAYMENTS UP TO $1,500 AND YOU KNOW THEY CANNOT PAY FOR THAT. THEN I WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO FREEZE INTEREST RATES FOR FIVE YEARS. LET'S JUST SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RAISE THE INTEREST RATES ON OUR MORTGAGES. [APPLAUSE] WE WANT TO CONVERT THESE UNAFFORDABLE MORTGAGES INTO LOANS THAT FAMILIES CAN PAY FOR. IF YOU HAVE AN ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES AND IS ABOUT TO SKYROCKET, YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO STAY IN YOUR HOME AND PAY AFFORDABLE PAYMENTS NOW, WE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE TO END THE ABUSIVE PRACTICES THAT GOT US WHERE WE ARE. THIS IS WHAT MIGHT GET THE MOST UPSET ABOUT. I HEARD ABOUT IT YESTERDAY, TALKING TO HOMEOWNERS IN NEVADA. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE FIRST- TIME HOMEOWNERS, OR MOVED TO A LARGER HOME HOME, SIGNED THESE MORTGAGE PAPERS. I SCANNED MY MORTGAGE PAPERS. I DID NOT READ THEM. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS IN ALL THAT FINE PRINT. MOST PEOPLE WHO SIGNED ON THE DOTTED LINE WERE LIED TO ON WHAT THEY WERE TOLD. A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THEY TALKED TO THEIR FRIENDS AND HER FAMILY. IN ADDITION TO INTEREST PAYMENTS, PEOPLE STARTED TO PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE CHECK BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING. WHAT THEY DID NOT KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A PROVISION IN A LOT OF THESE MORTGAGES FOR PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. IF YOU TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING, IN YOUR MIND, THEN YOU GOT HAMMERED WITH AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. THE INVESTORS DID NOT WANT TO TO PAY OFF ANY SOONER. THEY WANTED TO PENALIZE YOU FOR TRYING. THERE ARE A LOT PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE BEING PUNISHED WHAT WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WAS THE RIGHT THING. NOW, WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST IN AN EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR FAMILIES WITH SKYROCKETING HEATING BILLS THIS WINTER. TODAY, MORE THAN 40 MILLION FAMILIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ASSISTANCE, BUT ONLY ABOUT 16% RECEIVE IT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN THE BELOW ZERO CHILL FACTOR AND SAYING TO US THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS. THEY CANNOT GO WITHOUT THE HEAT. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT? MAYBE THEY WILL NOT TAKE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. MAYBE THEY WILL NOT MAKE A MORTGAGE PAYMENT AND AND TRY TO CATCH UP WITH THAT LETTER. THAT IS WHY I WOULD PROVIDE $25 BILLION IN ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR HAD AN UP TO COVER EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO NEEDS IT. SO WE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING. [APPLAUSE] FOURTH, I WOULD EXTEND AND EXPAND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, INCLUDING DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF WEEKS THAT PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE. IF YOU ARE OUT OF WORK, AND YOU WERE STRUGGLING TO FIND A JOB, THEN YOU DESERVE A REAL EXTRA HELP. IF THE ECONOMY IS SLIDING INTO RECESSION, THERE MIGHT NOT BE A JOB THERE FOR YOU. SO WHAT ARE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON? IF YOU GET THAT MONEY IN YOUR POCKET, YOU WILL SPEND IT. THAT WILL GIVE THE ECONOMY AN IMMEDIATE BOOST. [APPLAUSE] AND FINALLY, I TOLD YOU WHAT I WOULD DO TO TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. HERE IS WHAT I WOULD DO TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THE IBEW AND IS DOING. THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE I WOULD PUT MONEY. I WOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO JUMP-START A GREEN COLLAR JOB OF ALL ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] -- GREEN COLLAR JOB GROWTH ALL ACROSS AMERICA. SOMETIMES, WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS, I GET BLANK STARES. I REALLY DO. BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT KNOW IF THEY HAVE NOT SEEN IT. PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT WHITE COLLAR JOBS THEM BLUE-COLLAR JOBS, BUT THE IDEA OF GREEN COLLAR JOBS IS SOMETHING THAT FOLKS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE. BUT I'VE TEAMED UP WITH ONE OF MY FELLOW SENATORS A FEW MONTHS AGO AND WE PASSED LEGISLATION TO PUT FEDERAL DOLLARS DOLLARS INTO BRING COLLAR JOBS. THESE RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS ARE HIGH-WAGE JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUT SOURCED. THIS IS WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE INVESTING IN WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS. [APPLAUSE] SO, NUMBER ONE, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT A GREEN BUILDING FUND TO REBUILD AND RENOVATE PUBLIC BUILDINGS, LIKE SCHOOLS, LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUILDINGS, TO MAKE THEM MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, AND I WOULD DO IT IMMEDIATELY. I WOULD ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYING THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY NEW FEDERAL BUILDINGS BUILT OR ANY ONE OF THE 500,000 THAT WE HAVE NOW RENOVATED UNLESS THEY BECOME ENERGY FASHION AND MOVED TOWARD CARBON NEUTRALITY. [APPLAUSE] THIS WOULD CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS AND EVENTUALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS. PEOPLE WOULD BE PUT TO WORK INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE AHEAD OF US. THAT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE WE CAN CATCH UP IN A HURRY IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT. YOU HAVE TO KNOW -- K. GERMANY, GERMANY DECIDED TO INVEST AND DOLLARS IN NEW ENERGY, PARTICULARLY SOLAR. THE LAST TIME I LOOKED, I DON'T THINK THE CLIMATE IN GERMANY IS AS GOOD AS IT IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE PUT MANY PEOPLE TO WORK IN A MUCH SMALLER ECONOMY, INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS. THEY DID ARE DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MOVE PRACTICALLY AND QUICKLY TOWARD RENEWABLE ENERGY. I WOULD ALSO PURSUE A CRASH WERE AUTHORIZATION PLAN TO HELP PEOPLE INSULATE THEIR OWN HOMES. YOU CAN SAVE UP TO 20 PERCENT ON YOUR ENERGY BILLS IF YOU START TODAY. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY HEATING IN THE COAL AND COOLING IN THE HOT. YOU CAN SAVE 20%. ON WHAT PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. HERE ARE JOBS GOING INTO INSULATE HOMES. MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE THICKER GLASS AND LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DELIVER ON THAT 20 PERCENT SAVINGS. I WOULD BEGIN TO ASK THE UTILITIES TO INVEST IN CONSULTATION. WE NEED TO START SAVING ON ENERGY. I HAVE TO APPLAUD CALIFORNIA. BACK IN THE 1970'S, WHICH SOME OF US CAN REMEMBER, [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] A LOT OF US WAITED IN LINE FOR GAS A LONG TIME. I REMEMBER GETTING MACRAME CAR IN LINE AT 5:00 A.M.. SPENDING AN HOUR OR TWO AND HAVE SOMEBODY WALK DOWN THE LINE OF CARS AND TELL US THEY HAD RUN OUT OF GAS. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST WAKE-UP CALL AN AMERICAN HISTORY HER HEAD -- CALL IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. THE PRICE OF OIL FELL. WE GOT OLD INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. NOT CALIFORNIA, CALIFORNIA TOOK A HARD LOOK AT GAS MILEAGE AND BEGAN TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. THEY TOOK A HARD LOOK GET ELECTRICITY USAGE. TODAY, ON AVERAGE, A CALIFORNIAN USES 50% LESS ELECTRICITY THAN ANYBODY ANYWHERE ELSE IN AMERICA. CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY, MADE A DIFFERENCE -- [APPLAUSE] AND I AM STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THE STATE IS TRYING TO DO TO BEGIN TO REGULATE TAILPIPE EMISSIONS. IT IS IN A BIG FIGHT WITH THE EPA AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, BUT CALIFORNIA TO BE THE LEADER AGAIN. I WOULD ALSO OFFER TAX CREDITS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE ENERGY CONSERVING FORCES. THIS IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IT IS SMART. I WAS RECENTLY BRIEFED ABOUT A NEW PLUNGE IN ELECTRIC CAR THAT RUNS ON A NEW BATTERY BY AN AMERICAN CARMAKER. THAT IS MY GOAL, TO HAVE THESE CARS MADE HERE IN AMERICA. AFTER TEST DRIVING IT FOR SIX MONTHS, THEY GOT 1,500 MILES ON 10 GALLONS OF GAS. NOTHING ABOUT THIS. -- THINK ABOUT THIS. IF HENRY FORD WERE TO GO UP TODAY AND A LOT IN THE PARKING LOT AND ASKED A COUPLE OF THE IBEW MEMBERS TO LET HIM LOOK IN YOUR CAR, HE WOULD BE AMAZED AT THE SIZE AND THE POWER. HE WOULD BE AMAZED AT THE GPS, THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY WOULD TALK TO YOU UNTIL YOU WERE TO GO. THAT IS SCIENCE FICTION. THEN HE WOULD LIVE UP THE HOOD, AND WHAT WOULD HE SEE? THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. IT REALLY HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE THE MODEL T. WE NEED EVERYTHING FROM OUR VEHICLES TO OUR HOMES, TO OUR UTILITIES, AND MAKE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO WORSEN AND ALL THAT I PROPOSED WAS PUT INTO PLACE AS A JUMP START TO GET CONSUMER SPENDING AGAIN, THEN I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK IT PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL $40 BILLION IN TAX REBATES TO WORKING AND MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, NOT TO THE WEALTHY. THEY HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN THEIR SHARE OF OUR TAX DOLLARS HER HEAD THIS RELIEF WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THE OTHER INITIATIVES I HAVE OUTLINED TODAY. IT WOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE, SHORT-TERM HELP, IT TARGETED TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. IT WOULD BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. IT WOULD THIS BE EASY, NO. I THINK IF IT WERE EASY, SOME OTHER COUNTRY WOULD DO IT. WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT HIS HEART. WE ARE THE INNOVATION NATION. YEARS FROM NOW, I HOPE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WILL LOOK BACK AT THIS ELECTION, AND SAY THANK GOODNESS. THIS IS WHERE AMERICA CAME BACK, AND WE CAME BACK STRONG. YES, RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE IN A BITTER COLD. WE HAVE TO DIG OURSELVES OUT. I WANT TO PASS OUT SHELLS TO EVERYBODY. I DO NOT THINK IT IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST TO BORROW MONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. ELECTIONS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SPEECHES. THEY ARE NOT JUST ABOUT ALL THE CAMERA SHOWING UP. THEY ARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A LEADER HAS TO FINALLY MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS. WE'VE GOT CHALLENGES AROUND THE WORLD. WE HAD ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES, AND I AM LISTENING AND I HAVE ALWAYS LISTENED. I WANT TO BE YOUR VOICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS AMERICA'S COMMON PURPOSE. LET'S MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. CROWD: HILLARY, HILLARY, HILLARY, HILLARY. >> LET ME JUST SAY THAT I HAVE LEARNED MORE BY AND LISTENING. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE ABOUT ANYTHING ON THE MINDS. IF YOU HAVE TO GIVE BACK TO WORK OR YOU HAVE TO GET ON TO YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT, THANK YOU FOR COMING. BUT THOSE OF YOU THE WANT TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS, THEN I WILL CALL ON THE HANDS THAT I SEE. >> NO, THAT IS CERTAINLY THE KIND THIS OFFER I HAVE HAD. BUT I WOULD PROBABLY GET ARRESTED. >> IRID CAN EVEN THINK ABOUT WHO MIGHT RUNNING MATE WILL BECOME A BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. WE HAVE A LOT OF DELEGATES OF FOR GRABS. I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE MY CASE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. YES, I SEE THAT LADY'S HIM RIGHT THERE. >> HERE COMES A MICROPHONE. I KNOW IT IS A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD. >> HI, MY NAME IS AUDREY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME THE WAY YOU HAVE TRAILBLAZED. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION. I WAS WONDERING WHY YOU VOTED THE WAY THAT YOU DID FOR THE IRANIAN NATIONAL GUARD AS FAR AS CATEGORIZING THEM AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. >> THAT IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. HERE ARE THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT OF IT WAS THE RIGHT VOTE. THE WAY THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT OPERATES, AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND THIS, THERE IS REALLY TO GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT OF LIGHT AND IN A SHOT -- I HAVE BEEN A SHOAHMADINEJAD. THEN THERE IS ANOTHER ONE. THEY HAVE SUPPORTED TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD. THEY HAVE SUPPORTED IN HEZBOLLAH. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS FROM ARGENTINA TO SAUDI ARABIA AND BEYOND. THEY ALSO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF AMERICANS IN IRAQ. THEY HAVE SINNED IN EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. THEY HAVE SAID IN A TECHNICAL ADVISERS. THOSE ARE THE FACTS. I HAVE BEEN AGAINST, VOCALISE SO, AGAINST CAUSING A MILITARY CONFRONTATION WITH IRAN. THAT SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED. HE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. WE HAVE TO PREVENT HIM FROM TAKING INTO ANOTHER WAR. [APPLAUSE] AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT IRAN. THEY RESPOND TO CARROTS AND STICKS DESIGNATING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, GAVE US ANOTHER TOOL TO USE IF WE PURSUE DIPLOMACY, WHICH IS WHAT I AM ADVOCATING. WE SHOULD BE HAVING DIPLOMACY. I THINK YOU ARE BETTER WHEN YOU GO INTO DIPLOMACY IF YOU COME WITH SOME THINGS THAT THEY MIGHT LIKE, WITH SOME TOUGH MEASURES THAT THEY DO NOT LIKE. SHORTLY AFTER THEY WERE DESIGNATED A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, OUR MILITARY COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND SAID THAT THEY BEGAN TO SEE A DECREASE IN THE INFLOW OF WEAPONS USED AGAINST AMERICANS. THEY RESPOND TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE. WE LEARNED THAT THEY STOPPED MUCH OF THEIR EFFORT TO GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN 2003 BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THEM. IT IS VERY UNFAIR AND MISLEADING TO CHARACTERIZE THAT VOTE AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A VIEW TO LABEL THEM AND THEN USE THAT LABEL TO REIN THEM IN AND PREVENT THEM FROM EXPLODING IN THE REGION WITH TERRORISM AND FINANCING FOR ALL KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT ONLY AGAINST OUR INTERESTS, BUT VERY DESTABILIZING. EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR THAT CERTAINLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT WAS NOT SOME KIND OF VOTE TO HELP GEORGE BUSH. I THINK THAT WHAT I HAVE DONE TO MAKE THAT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IS TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT SAYS THAT GEORGE BUSH DOES NOT HAVE ANY AUTHORITY WHATSOEVER TO DO ANYTHING MILITARILY AGAINST IRAN. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW IS BILL? >> HOW DOES BILL? HE IS GREAT. HE WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I TOLD HIM WHERE I WAS COMING, THIS MORNING, BECAUSE WE HAD A WHOLE ENERGY AUDIT DONE ON OUR HOME. WE HAVE AN OLD FARMHOUSE. IT IS GREAT TO LIVE IN. BUT IT WAS PRETTY LUCKY. IT ARE UTILITY BILLS WERE PRETTY HIGH. WE HAVE NOW MOVED ALL OF OUR LIGHTING TO COMPAQ FOR ASSEMBLED, AND WE HAVE BEGUN TO INSTALL WINDOWS WITH A HIGHER RATING. WE HAVE TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE OUR HOME LOSS OF A PROBLEM. IN NEW YORK, WHERE WE LIVE, YOU EAT WITH HEATING OIL. IT IS REALLY EXPENSIVE. SAVING MONEY, WE ARE TRYING TO USE CLEAN ENERGY AND WE ARE BUYING WIND ENERGY. HE WAS SO EXCITED WHEN HE HEARD THAT I WAS COMING TO SEE WHAT THE IBEW WAS DOING TO BE THE LEADER IN THIS INDUSTRY. WENT BACK THERE? >> YOU MENTIONED THE WHOLE THE WE NEED TO DIG OURSELVES OUT. GIVE US A SHOVEL AND TELLS WHERE TO START DIGGING. >> THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. I WANT TO GIVE $5 BILLION TO THIS EFFORT THAT YOU ARE EXEMPLIFYING. WE MAY HAVE TO SEND SOME OF YOUR FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO SHOW PEOPLE OTHER MEMBERS WHAT WE CAN DO. I INTEND TO GIVE YOU A LOT OF SHELLS. I NEED YOUR HELP. SO MANY PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] YES? >> WE ARE WORKING WITH CITIES TO PROMOTE CLEAN AIR AND HOW LONG INITIATIVES. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE TO THE NEEDS OF THE CITY'S TO INCORPORATE THEIR AGENDAS. >> I AM PLEASED THAT THE MAYOR IS HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING HAILED AS THE MOST ENERGY- EFFICIENT CITY IN AMERICA. WE HAVE TO DO THIS ACROSS AMERICA. THIS IS GOOD FOR RURAL AMERICA BECAUSE TO GET A LOT OF BIOFUELS. JOHN IS A FARMER. THERE ARE FARMERS ALL ACROSS AMERICA THAT ARE MAKING MONEY BY HAVING WIND TURBINES ON THEIR FORM. WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH EVERYTHING. GEOTHERMAL, I HAD BEEN IN HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE FUELLED BY GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT EVERYTHING, AND THE CITIES CAN REALLY PROFIT FROM THIS. WE CAN GET ENERGY COSTS DOWN. IN EVERY CITY IN AMERICA, WE HAVE THE RESIDUE OF THE PREVIOUS INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY. LOSS OF TOXIC SITES. PLACES THAT ARE HARD TO BUILD ON BECAUSE THERE ARE SO EXPENSIVE TO CLEAN UP. YOU COULD PUT A SOLAR ARRAY OR WIND TURBINES THERE. WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT THIS. THERE IS A GREAT PROGRAM IN OAKLAND THAT IS TRAINING INNER- CITY KIDS. THERE ARE MAKING IT CLEAR THAT TRAINING INNER-CITY KIDS TO BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF CLEAN ENERGY PUTS THEM TO WORK AND GIVES THEM A JOB SKILLS AND THE REAL FUTURE. WE ARE GOING TO GROW THIS SEGMENT OF THE ECONOMY. WE ARE TO DO THIS ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] BACK THERE? YES. [INAUDIBLE] >> DURING KATRINA, HE SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT BASICALLY BANNED UNIONS FOR WORKING ON THE KATRINA DISASTER. WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR US? >> THE LABOR AGREEMENTS WERE SUCH SHORTSIGHTED APPROACHES, THAT THERE ADMINISTRATION WAS SUCH SO ANTI-UNION AND AN ANTI LABOR THAT THEY ACTUALLY TOLD BUSINESS IS NOT TO COOPERATE WITH UNIONS. THERE WERE TOLD NOT TO HAVE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. WE HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO GIVE SOME OF THEM GOING. A LOT OF OUR CONTRACTORS, THEY SAID THIS WAS GREAT FOR US. WE HAVE RELIABLE UNION LABOR. IT IS ACTUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO IT OVER AGAIN. HE DID NOT HAVE ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE HAD DOWN THE ROAD. [APPLAUSE] AMONG THE MANY THINGS I'M GOING TO DO WITH IN THE FIRST DAYS OF BECOMING PRESIDENT, I WILL ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, OVERTURNING THE BUSH'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON HE ALWAELAS YES? >> I HAVE A BUSINESS IN GLENDALE. PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS, AND THEY DO NOT COME TO MY SHOP ANYMORE. THE LAST THREE YEARS, I HAVE HAD NO MONEY BECAUSE I AM NOT 65. WHEN YOU COME RESIDENT, -- WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, TO YOU HAVE ANYTHING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT I'M ABLE TO REOPEN MY BUSINESS? >> GREAT QUESTION. [APPLAUSE] SMALL BUSINESS DOES CREATE MOST JOBS IN AMERICA. SMALL BUSINESSES WERE SOARING DURING THE 1990'S. MORE SMALL BUSINESSES WERE SUCCESSFUL. THAT CREATED THE MARKET AND HAD A GOOD PRODUCT. THEY ALSO HAD A SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AT CARED ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES. WE WERE THERE WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES NEED. WE WERE THERE TO GIVE YOU SUPPORT. WOMEN OWNED AND MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES AND NOT GET A FAIR SHAKE. I WILL CERTAINLY BEGIN TO DO THAT. SECONDLY, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT SMALL BUSINESSES GET HELP ON HEALTH CARE AND ENERGY COSTS. SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY TOUGH FOR CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES TO MANAGE. AS JOHN GARAMENDI WAS SANE, HE AND I HAVE WORKED ON THIS BEFORE. ONE THING THAT WE WILL DO IS GIVE TAX CREDITS SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HELP YOUR EMPLOYEES GET HEALTH CARE. FINALLY, WE HAVE TO GET THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] THE ECONOMY HAS TO PRODUCE JOBS. UNEMPLOYMENT IS UP. THE DOLLAR IS SO WEAK THAT EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF OUR MANUFACTURING PLANTS ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOW DOLLAR COME WE HAVE LOST SO MANY MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT ARE WE BEHIND ON THIS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR SMALL BUSINESS, BIG BUSINESS, AND FAMILIES IS TO GET A ECONOMY WORKING AGAIN. I WILL DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE] [APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE KNOWN SINCE THE YEAR 2000 AND I WOULD VOTE FOR YOU FOR PRESIDENT. I KNEW YOU WERE BORN TO RUN, HILARY. [APPLAUSE] MY DAUGHTER JUST TEXT MESSAGED ME AND ASK IF YOU HAD ANY RESERVATIONS BEING THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT? >> NO, NOT AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO RUN TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT AND BREAK THE GLASS CEILING. [APPLAUSE] MIGHT 88 YEAR-OLD MOTHER IS LIVING WITH US. SHE WAS BORN BEFORE WOMEN COULD VOTE IN AMERICA TREATED WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF OUR DAUGHTERS, AND ALL OF THE OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE, IT HAS BEEN EXCITING, EVEN IN MY OWN LIFETIME, TO SEE THE PROGRESS. I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN, I AM RUNNING BECAUSE I BELIEVE I AM THE MOST EXPERIENCED PERSON TO DO THE JOB FOR OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] YES? I LOVE THE SLOGAN. IS EARTH, ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY. >> I AM A LOCAL 11 ELECTRICIAN. HOW DO YOU INTEND ON BRINGING HOME IN AND RETURNING THEM SAFELY. WE'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH HOW GOVERNMENT IS DISCHARGING MEMBERS WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF PERSONALITY DISORDER WHEN IT REALLY DOIS PSD. >> HOW MANY VETERANS TO HAVE IN THIS AUDIENCE? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. HERE'S WHAT I WILL DO. AS SOON AS I AM ELECTED, I WILL ASK THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND MY SECURITY ADVISERS TO GET ME A PLAN SO THAT I COULD BEGIN BRINGING HOME OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WITHIN 60 DAYS. THE REASON I HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN IS BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE PLANNING BY THE TIME I GET THERE. I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT. LAST SPRING, I WROTE TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND I SAID THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE BRIEFED ON WHAT PLANNING THAT WE HAVE DONE TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME SAFELY. THEY SAID THERE WERE OUT OF TOWN, AND I TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE. WE FINALLY GOT A HEARING, AND IS CLASSIFIED, SO I CANNOT TALK IN DETAIL ABOUT IT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WAS PRETTY CURSORILY. THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT WANT THE PENTAGON TO DO THE KIND OF OPERATIONAL PLANNING. IF YOU'RE TO MOVE TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT, YET TO BE REALLY AWFUL. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THEM OUT IN CONVOYS, WHICH HAS BEEN THE PRINCIPAL WAY THAT WE HAVE LOST OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AND HAVE SO MANY THOUSANDS INJURED. I ALSO SAID THAT WE CAN BEGIN WITHDRAWING OUR TROOPS WITHIN 60 DAYS. I THINK THAT WE CAN BRING OUT ONE TO TWO BRIGADES THAT TIME. THEY'VE ARE WORKING FOR CHARITABLE GROUPS. WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE IRAQIS WHO SIDED WITH US? I WENT INTO FALLUJAH WITH JOHN MCCAIN. WE WERE THERE SHORTLY AFTER THE MARINES HAD TAKEN BACK FALLUJAH IN A VERY BLOODY BATTLE. I MET A LOT OF THE YOUNG CAPTAIN'S AND MAJORS WHO HAVE LED THAT BATTLE. ONE CAPTAIN SAID THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR OUR IRAQI TRANSLATOR, ME AND MY MEN WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED. THEN HE SAID THAT PEOPLE NOW KNOW THAT HE WAS A TRANSLATOR FOR THE MARINES, SO HE AND HIS FAMILY ARE TARGETED. HE ASKED ME WHAT I WAS FOR TO DO ABOUT THEM. I TOLD HIM THAT I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE HONORABLE FOR AMERICAN TO LEAVE PEOPLE BEHIND HAD BEEN FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE WITH OUR SOLDIERS. WHEN WE BRING THEM HOME, LET'S TAKE CARE OF THEM. WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS THAT WE ARE BRINGING HOME PROFOUNDLY INJURED YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. IT IS NOT ONLY PHYSICAL, IT IS ALSO A PSYCHOLOGICAL, EMOTIONAL. I WAS AT WALTER REED A FEW MONTHS AGO CHECKING ON NEW YORK SOLDIERS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE BEING TAKEN CARE OF. I MET A YOUNG ARMY CAPTAIN. HE HAD LOST HIS RIGHT ARM IN AN ATTACK. HE LOST HIS RING FINGER ON HIS LEFT HAND BECAUSE HIS WEDDING BEN, UNDER THE HEAT OF THE EXPLOSION, HAD MELTED INTO ITS CENTER. I ASK HIM HOW HE WAS DOING AND HE SAID THE PEOPLE AT HELPING HIM WERE TERRIFIC. HE ASKED WHERE HE HAD TO GO TO GET HIS BRAIN BACK. IN ADDITION TO POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, WE HAVE A NEW INJURY CALLED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. IT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR IN PROXIMITY TO EXPLOSIONS HIT IT LITERALLY SHAKES YOUR BRAIN. YOU LOOK FINE, MAYBE YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL INJURY, BUT THIS YOUNG MAN SAID THAT HE HAD GONE TO WEST POINT, AND NOW HIS WIFE HAS TO GIVE HIM A LIST EVERY MORNING THAT TELLS THEM WHERE TO GO ON WHAT TO DO. I HAVE COMMITTED MYSELF TO PASS LEGISLATION TO TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF OUR HEROES COMING HOME. BUT I THINK WHEN SOMEONE SERVES OUR COUNTRY, WE TAKE AN OATH, WHETHER WE RAISE OUR HANDS OR NOT TO SERVE THEM. , TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS, AND I WILL. I PROMISE YOU THAT. AND THERE ARE SO MANY HANDS AND SO MANY PLACES. YES, YOU, DEAR? >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MY NAME IS SUSAN. I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS IN LOS ANGELES. IT IS HARD TO FOLLOW THE ONE THAT YOU WERE JUST AS FIRM BECAUSE I WAS SO POIGNANT. IF YOU WANT TO BRING THE ECONOMY UP, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT IS OWED BY COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA. WE DO NOT HAVE OUR COUNTRY AS THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS. HOW DO WE DO ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, AND DO THAT WITHOUT BEING MANIPULATED BY FORCES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES? >> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. I HAVE BEEN WARNING ABOUT THIS. I WARNED ABOUT IT WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH CAME INTO OFFICE WE HAD A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. [APPLAUSE] WE HAD FAITH REJECTED 546 TRILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DO WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE SURE SECURITY WAS STABLE AT TO MAKE SURE THAT MEDICARE WOULD ALWAYS BE THERE. WE NOW HAVE A NINE TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT. THAT DEBT IS OWED TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY. WE OWE MONEY TO EVERYBODY. WE HAVE SOME VERY BIG LENDERS LIKE CHINA. PEOPLE SAY TO THE ALL THE TIME THAT WE NEED TO GET TOUGH ON CHINA OVER TRADE AND OVER CURRENCY MANIPULATION. I STARTED SAYING FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO, HOW YOU GET TOUGH ON YOUR BANKER? HAD USED THEM UP AND TELL SOMEBODY THAT YOU SO MUCH MONEY TO, AND BECAUSE THE BUSH REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SO FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE, THE CONTINUED TO BORROW THIS MONEY FOR TWO REASONS. TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY AND THE WAR IN IRAQ IT SO HERE'S WHAT WILL WARM TO DO. WHEREUNTO IN THE WAR IN IRAQ. THAT MEANS $300 MILLION THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO BE SPENT IN IRAQ ANY LONGER. [APPLAUSE] . I THINK I CAN TAKE A COUPLE MORE. I WANT TO GO TO PLACES I HAVE NOT BEEN. THERE IS A LEADING BACK THERE IN BLUE. -- A LADY BACK THERE IN BLUE. >> [INAUDIBLE] RIGHT. >> [INAUDIBLE] HERE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT. I HAVE TRIED TO DO IT IN THE PAST AS A SENATOR, BUT I THINK WE CAN REALLY MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS. WE STILL HAVE TAX BREAKS IN OUR TAX CODE THAT GO TO COMPANIES THAT MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS. THE BIGGEST ONE IS THIS ONE. IF YOU HAVE A COMPANY HERE IN AMERICA -- DOES NOT MATTER WHAT SIZE IT IS -- YOU PAY TAXES ON YOUR PROFITS THAT YOU REALIZED IN AMERICA, BUT WE HAVE A BIG TAX BREAK, SO THAT EACH YOU MOVE JOBS HERE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY AND YOU MAKE A PROFIT, AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT BRING MONEY HOME, YOU DID NOT HAVE TO PAY TAXES. SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN EFFECT IS SUBSIDIZE THE LOSS OF OUR JOBS. THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY. SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO BUSINESS AND CREATE JOBS IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO STOP THEM, BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT -- WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM A PENNY OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO END ALL OF THOSE TAX BREAKS. [APPLAUSE] YES, RIGHT THERE. >> I VOTED FOR YOUR HUSBAND IN MY FIRST ELECTION. AND AGAIN WHEN HE WAS REELECTED, WHICH IS GREAT. MY FATHER HAS BEEN A BUSINESS OWNER FOR 30 YEARS. HE IS NOT OF THE BEST OF HEALTH, AND WE TRIED TO GIVE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR HIM, BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD IT. IT IS ABOUT $1,000 TO COVER HIM FOR MONTHS. -- PER MONTH. WE REALLY NEED GOOD HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THE SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. AND BECAUSE OF YOUR HUSBAND AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE HE DID GIVE US DURING THE TIME HE WAS OUR PRESIDENT, MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE, BUT NOW THAT THEY ARE GETTING OF AGE, IT IS GOING TO BE EVEN HARDER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORKING, AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN COLLEGE, SO THEY WILL BE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE FOR A CERTAIN TIME. WE REALLY NEED SOMETHING VERY STRONG FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. >> YOUR 100 PERCENT RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] -- YOU ARE 100 PERCENT RIGHT. ONE OF THE PROGRAMS I HELPED TO START 10 YEARS AGO WAS THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH YOUR YOUNGER SIBLINGS ARE NOW ON. WE HAD 6 MILLION KIDS AROUND THE COUNTRY GET HEALTH INSURANCE WHO NEVER HAD IT BEFORE, AND I WANT TO EXPAND AS SO IT COVERS EVERY CHILD. I HAVE A PLAN THAT WOULD GIVE YOUR FATHER, YOUR MOTHER, YOURSELF, AND EVERYBODY HERE HEALTH INSURANCE IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE IT, AND IT IS VERY SIMPLE. EACH YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER, THROUGH A GOOD UNION CONTRACT, AND YOU ARE HAPPY WITH IT, NOTHING CHANGES. YOU KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE, BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION IF SOMETHING DOES CHANGE TO JOIN PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED AND PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE AFFORDABLE INSURANCE, OR IT DOES NOT COVER WHAT THEY NEED BECAUSE WE WILL OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN TO EVERYBODY. CONGRESS HAS A REALLY GOOD PLAN FOR ITSELF AND ITS STAFF AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE OVER 250 DIFFERENT CHOICES THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS. IF YOU ARE 24 YEARS OLD, SINGLE, HEALTHY, YOU MAY NEED JUST HEALTH INSURANCE AGAINST A CATASTROPHE LIKE A CAR ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IF YOU ARE A 45-YEAR-OLD FATHER TWO, YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR KIDS. EVERYBODY WILL BE ELIGIBLE, AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PICK AMONG THESE 250 PLANS THAT COVER PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE, MENTAL HEALTH CARE, DENTAL CARE BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY GET HEALTHIER, NOT GET SICKER. THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT NEEDS YOU HAVE, AND IF -- . [APPLAUSE] IF YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF WHAT THE PLAN IS THAT I GET THROUGH THE CONGRESS, IT IS CHEAPER THAN WHAT YOU CAN GET THROUGH AN EMPLOYER OR WHERE YOU GET THE PRIVATE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE TAXPAYERS PAY 75 PERCENT OF THE COST. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS OPEN IT UP AND SAY IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD IT, WE WILL PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS. WE WILL GIVE THEM TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. WE WILL LIMIT WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR HEALTH PREMIUMS SO THAT YOU CAN BUDGET IT. IT WILL NOT BE JUMPING OF THE WAY IT IS TODAY. $1,000 FOR AN INDIVIDUAL FOR A MONTH. $1,200 FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY POLICY IN AMERICA. AND WE WILL HELP SMALL BUSINESSES BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT, AS I SAID BEFORE. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY EASIER FOR ME TO SAY, ""LET'S LEAVE SOME PEOPLE UP"" BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID THAT. ONE OF MY LEADING OPPONENTS DECIDED NOT TO COVER EVERYBODY. BUT WHO YOU LEAVE OUT? DO YOU LEAVE OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY SICK? WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL AND JUST HOPE THEY DO NOT GET SICK? I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT NOT TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON OUR PROBLEMS, BUT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. I WILL SOLVE THEM. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE]",2015-11-07 17:13:31,2008-01-11,Commerce,California
http://www.c-span.org/video/?203565-1/huckabee-campaign-event,Huckabee Campaign Event,Mike Huckabee,"REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MIKE HUCKABEE CAMPAIGNED IN DESTROIT, MICHIGAN FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE PRIMARY. HE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF HIS ECONOMIC POLICIES AS A GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS AND HOW HE COULD IMPLEMENT THEM AS PRESIDENT. . >> I WAS THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I GOT TO THE MEETING EARLY. I DECIDED TO MAKE SURE I WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE. I WAS GOING UP THE STAIRS INTO THE BUILDING AND ANOTHER MAN WAS GOING OUT. TO MAKE SMALL TALK CAN'T MAKE SURE THAT I WAS AT THE RIGHT LOCATION, -- TO MAKE SMALL TALK AND MAKE SURE THAT I WAS AT THE RIGHT LOCATION, HE EITHER DID NOT RECOGNIZE ME OR HE DID NOT CARE. HE SAID IT WAS WITH THE ROTARY CLUB MET BUT I PICKED A BAD DAY TO VISIT BECAUSE THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WAS GOING TO TALK THAT DAY. [LAUGHTER] I AM ALREADY VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE STILL HAVE A ROOMFUL OF PEOPLE. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL EXPERIENCES IN MICHIGAN. MY FAVORITE HAPPEN WHEN MY WIFE AND I CAME UP AND SPENT THE WEEKEND WITH THE ENGLISLERTS. WE WORKED ON WELFARE REFORM WITH EACH OTHER. WE GOT TO SEE IT IMPLEMENTED. WE SAW THE JOY HELPING GET PEOPLE FROM STATE DEPENDENCY TO INDEPENDENCE. HE WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THAT. HE IS A GREAT GUY AND A DEAR FRIEND. WE WENT OUT TO THE ISLAND. WE SPENT A WEEKEND FISHING. WE ATE THE CATCH OF THE DAY. JOHN REMAINS A GOOD FRIEND. I KNOW HE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE STATE IN A WONDERFUL PERSON. I AM ALSO THRILLED BECAUSE MICHIGAN IS HOME TO MOTORS AND MANUFACTURING. IT IS ALSO HOME TO SOME OF THE GREATEST MUSIC OF ALL TIME. MY PLAN IS TO GO BY THE MOTOWN MUSEUM AND SEE WHERE THE FAULT BROTHERSEE WHERE THE FUNK BROTHERS LAID DOWN SOME TRACKS. I ALSO ENJOY A GRAND FUNK. IT IS ANOTHER GREAT BAND AND OF THE STATE. THE MUSIC FROM MICHIGAN IS WONDERFUL. PEOPLE LOOK AT MAN MICHIGAN IN THE MESS IN CAPTURINGAND THE MANUFACTURING BASE AS BEING ONE OF THE COUNTRY. THE EPICENTER OF THE IMPORT ARSENAL WAS MICHIGAN. I SAY THIS IN PART BECAUSE I AM IN MICHIGAN AND THERE IS AN ELECTION ON TUESDAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT I ALSO SAY IT BECAUSE IT IS THE TREES. IN MANY WAYS, IT WAS THE MANUFACTURING AND GENIUS OF MISSION THAT SAVED THIS COUNTRY WHEN WE HAD TO TURN OUR CAPACITY TOWARDS TAKING CARE OF OUR WAR EQUIPMENT TO FIGHT OUR WAY THROUGH THE SECOND WORLD WAR. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE CAPACITY TO QUICKLY MOBILIZE THOSE RESOURCES, WE MIGHT NOT BE SITTING HERE WITH THE FREEDOM THAT WE HAVE TODAY. I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A TIME IN OUR HISTORY WHEN MICHIGAN SAVED AMERICA. NOW IT MAY BE TIME FOR AMERICA TO HELP SAVE MICHIGAN. [APPLAUSE] A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM MY STATE CAME HERE THROUGH THE YEARS BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT THE FARM ECONOMY HAD DRAMATICALLY CHANGED IN THE SOUTH. THEY NEEDED JOBS. MANY OF THEM CAME HERE AND THEY FOUND WORKE. THEY FOUND A GOOD WORK. THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND CONSISTENCY FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THERE WERE ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PUT MONEY ASIDE FOR THE FUTURE. WHERE I COME FROM, THAT WAS NOT THE WAY A LOT OF PEOPLE GROW UP. THAT INCLUDED MY OWN FAMILY. ANOTHER WAS THE OLDEST OF SEVEN CHILDREN. -- MY MOTHER WAS THE OLDEST OF SEVEN CHILDREN. THEY WERE DIRT-POOR WITH OUTDOOR TOILETS. MY FATHER GREW UP IN THE TOWN OF HOPE, ARKANSAS. HE WAS A FIREMAN. ON HIS DAYS OFF, HE WORKED AS A MECHANIC. HE WORKED WITH HIS HANDS AND GOT THE DIRT OF THE DAY ON HIS HANDS AND NEVER COULD QUITE GET IT OFF. IT IS TRUE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY SO WE HAD IN MY HOUSE AS A LITTLE CHILD WAS LAVA SOAP. FOR THE UNINITIATED, IT MEANS I WAS IN COLLEGE BEFORE I FOUND OUT IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HURT WHEN YOU TOOK A SHOWER. I AM ALWAYS AMAZED AT THE PEOPLE GO TO SPAS TO GET EXFOLIATED. A BAR OF THAT SOAP WILL DO IT AND IT WILL ONLY COST 50 CENTS. [LAUGHTER] I DO NOT RECOMMEND MEN GIVE THAT TO THEIR WIVES AS VALENTINE GIFT. [LAUGHTER] MY PARENTS GREW UP LIKE MANY OTHER CHILDREN IN THE DEEP SOUTH. THEY KNEW POVERTY AND STRUGGLE. THEY KNEW HARDSHIP. THEY WERE NEVER ASSURED THAT THERE WOULD BE THE FOOD THE NEXT DAY. THEY WENT THROUGH THE DEPRESSION AND A WORLD WAR. THEY WANTED ONE THING FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THEY WANTED US TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE. NO MAIL BEFORE ME AND EVEN GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL MUCH LESS ON TO COLLEGE. MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO HAVE AN EDUCATION. THEY KNEW IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION AND WORKER. THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF AMERICA STILL GET DOWN TO HARD WORK, A GOOD EDUCATION, AND STRONG FAMILY. THOSE THINGS HAVE ALWAYS MADE IS THE CENTERPIECE OF THE WORLD ECONOMY. I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS PARTS OF IT THAT ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. IT IS OFTEN THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT ANY COUNTRY HAS TO BE ABLE TO DO IN ORDER TO REMAIN FREE. IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO FEED ITSELF. IF IT WERE DEPENDS ON ANOTHER COUNTRY TO FEED ITS COUNTRY AND OUTSOURCES THE FOOD, WHOEVER CONTROLS THE FOOD IS IN CHARGE OF THE FUTURE. IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO FUEL ITSELF. IT IS URGENT THAT WE BECOME ENERGY INDEPENDENT WITH DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED AND SELF- SUFFICIENT ENERGY SOURCES. IF WE DO NOT, WE WILL FOREVER BE ENSLAVED TO THOSE WHO MAKE OUR ENERGY. THEY WILL CONTROL THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THEY WILL CONTROL OUR ECONOMY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. THEY WILL ALSO CONTROL OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] A COUNTRY HAS GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR ITSELF. THAT MEANS IT MUST BE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE ITS OWN WEAPONS OF SELF-DEFENSE. THE REASON THAT MANUFACTURING IS IMPORTANT TO THIS COUNTRY IS NOT JUST ABOUT JOBS. THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH OF A REASON. BUT IT IS ALSO A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. THE DAY THAT WE OUTSOURCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR WEAPONS OF SELF-DEFENSE IS THE DAY THAT WE OUTSOURCED OUR NATIONAL SECURITY TO WHOEVER IS SUPPLYING THE DISEASE. THAT SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO ALL OF US AND CERTAINLY TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MUST BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE CAPACITIES TO FIGHT FOR OURSELVES. A FEW MONTHS AGO, ALL OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WERE INVITED TO DEARBORN, MICH., FOR SOME OF THE DEBATES. HE MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF THEM. HE MAY HAVE STAYED AWAKE FOR SOME OF THEM. -- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF THEM. YOU MAY HAVE STAYED AWAKE FOR SOME OF THEM. WE WERE ASKED ABOUT HOW WE THOUGHT THE ECONOMY WAS DOING. EACH OF MY COLLEAGUES GAVE GLOWING VIEWS OF THE ECONOMY. THEY QUOTED RIGHT FROM THE PLAYBOOK OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE TALKING POINTS. I GUESS THAT IS WHAT ANY GOOD REPUBLICAN WOULD DO. WHEN THEY CAME TO ME, I HAD A DIFFERENT TAKE. I'M NOT JUST A CONTRARIAN, BUT I TRY TO THINK SEE THINGS HONESTLY AND REALISTICALLY. THEY SAID THE ECONOMY WAS DOING GREAT, PARTICULARLY THE MACRO ECONOMY. WE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE CAN LOOK AT THE GDP AND THE STOCK MARKET. MANY OF THE INDICATORS ARE REFLECTING A STRONG ECONOMY. BUT I SAID THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MACRO ECONOMICRO ECONOMY AND TALK TO THE PEOPLE ON THE LINE, YOU MIGHT GET A VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARDER THIS YEAR THAN THEY DID LAST YEAR. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE RISING AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION, AND BECAUSE EDUCATIONAL COSTS ARE SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL, AND BECAUSE FUEL PRICES ARE UP SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHERE THEY WERE ONE YEAR AGO -- IT MAY NOT BOTHER PEOPLE AT THE TOP. BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT PEOPLE WHO CAN BARELY PUT GAS IN THE TANK ARE BARELY PUTTING FEUD ON THE TABLE-- ARE ALSO BARELY PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. YOU ARE AFFECTING THEIR LIFESTYLE. WHEN THEY HAVE LESS DISCRETIONARY INCOME, THERE IS LESS MONEY TO PURCHASE THINGS. THE MERCHANTS START SUFFERING. THE MANUFACTURERS AND TRANSPORTERS START SUFFERING. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ECONOMY STARTS AFFECTING EVERYONE IN THE ECONOMY. I CANNOT BELIEVE THE IDEA THAT WE CAN HAVE TWO DIFFERENT AMERICAS. WE ARE ONE AMERICA. THAT MEANS WE RISE AND FALL TOGETHER. WE NEED TO UNITE TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN RISE TO THE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE. WE HAVE HAD MANY SUCCESSES. WE DO FACE SOME CHALLENGES. [APPLAUSE] LET ME MENTION THE CRISIS TODAY. WE HAVE LOST TWO 0.4 MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY. -- WE HAVE LOST 2.5 MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY RECENTLY. AT THE CENTER OF OUR UNIVERSE IS THE FAMILY, NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MY FOCUS ON STRONG FAMILIES AND MARRIAGES. THEY SAY THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH GOVERNING. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT. A STRONG AND STABLE FAMILY IS STABLE ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY. IF A PERSON GETS MARRIED AND STAYS IN A SOLID MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP, THEY GET A HIGH- SCHOOL DIPLOMA COME AND GET A JOB AND KEEP IT, AND REMAINED EMPLOYED STEADILY, THEY 90% CHANCE OF NEVER DROPPING INTO POVERTY. IF WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON THOSE THREE THINGS. WHEN DOES BREAK DOWN, WE SEE THE SPIRAL TOWARDS POVERTY. -- WHEN THOSE THINGS START TO BREAK DOWN, WE SEE THE SPIRAL TOWARDS PARTY. MY STATE IS VERY DEMOCRATIC. 90% OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE DEMOCRATS. I ALWAYS POLITICALLY PUSHED AGAINST THE WIND. HAVING SAID THAT, MY PARTY HAS GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POVERTY, DISEASE, HUNGER, HOMELESSNESS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. [APPLAUSE] WE MUST BEGIN TO BE LEADERS IN THIS ISSUE FS. THE CRISIS IS REAL AND IS TOUCHING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE. THERE IS A CAUSE -- THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WOULD CHOKE THE ECONOMY IN THIS COUNTRY. ONE OF THOSE IS FAILED EDUCATION. 6000 KIDS IN THIS COUNTRY DROP OUT OF SCHOOL EVERY DAY. THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO BE EMPLOYED IN MOST BUSINESSES. I ONCE TALKED TO A LARGE EVERY CLUB OF 500 MEMBERS. I SPOKE TO THEM WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR. I ASKED HOW MANY OF THEM COULD OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES IF NO ONE THEY EMPLOYED AT ANYTHING BUT A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT DROPOUTS. I WAS TALKING ABOUT A HIGH- SCHOOL EDUCATION AND NOTHING BEYOND IT. I WAITED AND NOT A SINGLE HAND WENT UP. I ASKED IF THEY COULD RUN THEIR ENTIRE OPERATIONS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH THE HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL LEVEL BEING HIGH SCHOOL. NOT ONE PERSON OUT OF THE 500 COULD SAY YES. THEY KNEW THAT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND HIGH SCHOOL, AT LEAST A FEW YEARS OF ADDITIONAL TRAINING, -- WE NEED A BARE MINIMUM OF 14 YEARS OF EDUCATION TO BE PREPARED FOR THE JOB MARKET. THE KIDS ARE NOT DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY ARE DUMB. THEY ARE BORED. WE HAVE TO FOCUS EDUCATION ON THE STUDENTS INSTEAD OF THE INSTITUTION ITSELF. PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE SEEN THE FAILURE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT A FOCUS ON TURNING KIDS INTO ROBOTS. WE TRY TO DOWNLOAD INFORMATION INTO THE LEFT SIDES OF THEIR BRAINS. WE HAVE SO FOCUSED ON VERY GOOD THINGS LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE. WE SHOULD DO THAT. BUT WE HAVE DONE IT TO THE EXCLUSION OF MUSIC AND ART. WHEN WE DO THAT, WE FAIL TO STIMULATE THE CREATIVE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. WE DO NOT HAVE AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. WE HAVE A DATA DOWNLOAD. I SUGGEST WE REDESIGN THE CURRICULUM AT EVERY STATE LEVEL SO WE UNLEASH WHAT I CALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTIO INSTRUCTION. WE EXTENDED THE CURRICULUM SO THAT EVERY STUDENT HAS MUSIC AND ART PROGRAMS. IT IS NOT EXTRA FOR TWO OR EXTREMIS. IT IS ESSENTIAL. -- IT IS NOT EXTRA RAINIES NEOUS. IT IS ESSENTIAL. TAXATION IS ALSO SOMETHING ELSE THAT HURTS US. I VISITED A MACHINE SHOP A FEW MONTHS AGO. I TALKED TO A MAN WHO WAS WORKING TO DIFFERENT SHIFTS AT THE MACHINE SHOP. HE SAID HE WAS DOING IT BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY. IT COST $54,000 PER YEAR. MY FIRST REACTION WAS THAT I WAS VERY GLAD MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT GOING THERE. [LAUGHTER] HE SAID THAT BECAUSE HE WAS WORKING THE SECOND SHIFT, HE WAS IN A HIGHER TAX BRACKET. THE HARDER HE WORKED, THE MORE THEY TAKE OUT OF HIS PAYCHECK. MOST OF HIS SECOND SHIFT WAS GOING TO PAY TAXES ON THE INCREASED INCOME. RATHER THAN BEING WORKED REWARDED FOR WORKING HARD, HE WAS BEING PENALIZED. IF HE INVESTED IT, HE WOULD BE TAXED FOR THAT. IF YOU BOUGHT AND SOLD SOMETHING, HE WOULD BE TAXED AS WELL. IF YOU WORKED SO HARD THAT HE DIED, WE WOULD TAXES INHERITANCE. WE WOULD GET HIM ANY WAY WE COULD. THE SYSTEM IS UPSIDE DOWN. IT IS COUNTER INTUITIVE TO A PROPER ECONOMY. I TOLD HIM HE COULD QUIT BOTH SHIPS AND GET GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. WHEN HE QUIT WORKING ALTOGETHER, HIS DAUGHTER QUALIFY FOR SOME ASSISTANCE. I HOPE HE DID NOT TAKE THE DEVICE BECAUSE I WAS KIDDING. BUT WHAT KIND OF CRAZY SYSTEM IS IT THAT DOES NOT REWARD HARD WORK THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY THE GREATEST ONE ON EARTH? >>-- I HOPE HE DID NOT TAKE THAT ADVICE BECAUSE I WAS KIDDING. THE TAX SYSTEM IS OUT OF CONTROL. I WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT. LET ME MENTION OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HURTING OUR ECONOMY. THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO COMPLICATE LIFE FOR THE BUSINESS PERSON AND THE ENTREPRENEUR. IT IS TO FACILITATE IT. IT SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER SO THAT IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT GET IN YOUR WAY. IT SHOULD BE PAVING THE WAY SO THE IDEA CAN WORK. THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON THE IDEA OF SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE WHO STARTED WITH NOTHING MORE THAN HARD WORK, A DREAM, AND MAYBE A HANDFUL OF MONEY THEY COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER. IN SOME CASES, IT WAS BY MORTGAGING THEIR HOMES AND BARLEY FROM FRANCE. -- AND BORROWING FROM FRIENDS. FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION IS ANOTHER PROBLEM. MANY PEOPLE COULD NOT STAY IN BUSINESS BECAUSE THEIR COMPETITION WAS THE COURT SYSTEM. THEY NEVER KNEW WHAT THE LIMIT OF THE LIABILITY MIGHT BE. THERE HAS TO BE SOME FINITE CAPACITY TO HAVE MUCH RISK THERE IS IN TERMS OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. AN ECONOMY CANNOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT IT. I AM CRITICIZED SOMETIMES BECAUSE WE DID A ROGUE PROGRAM. I INHERITED THE WORST ROADS IN THE COUNTRY WHEN I BECAME THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. THE TRUCKERS MAGAZINE SAID THEY WEREN'T THE WORST. THEY SHOULD KNOW. -- THE TRUCKERS MAGAZINE SAID THAT THEY WERE THE WORST ONES IN THE COUNTRY. THEY SHOULD KNOW. WHEN I LEFT OFFICE, THEY SAID THERE WERE THE BEST. IF WE DO NOT REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THEN WHAT IS THE SYSTEM UPON WHICH TO BUILD THE ECONOMY? YOU CAN BUILD THE GREATEST CARS BUT THE REDS ARE NOT GOOD, IT WILL NOT MATTER. WE ONCE SAW IN THE STRUCTURE AS A VITAL PART OF SECURITY AND THE ECONOMY. WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR, I REALIZED THAT I NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE PER-CAPITA INCOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MY STATE. IT WENT UP BY 50.3% DURING MY TENURE AS GOVERNOR. I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT. WHEN YOU RAISE THE PER CAPITA INCOME, EVERYTHING ELSE FLOATS UP ALONGSIDE IT. THERE SEVERAL ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE IN PLACE TO DO THAT. I THINK THIS IS A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT GOVERNORS HAVE. ISSUES CANNOT BE INDIVIDUAL. THEY MUST BE SEEN AS INTEGRATED PARTS OF AN OVERALL PLAN AND STRATEGY TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE FOR EVERY CHILD. THE CONCEPT IS THIS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT TEND TO SEE THINGS AS INDIVIDUAL ISSUES. THERE WILL FOCUS ON HEALTH OR EDUCATION OR JOB CREATION ON NATIONAL SECURITY. GOVERNORS DO NOT HAVE THAT LETTER. WE HAVE TO SEE THE WHOLE BATTLEFIELD AND NOT JUST ONE OR TWO OF THE BATTLES. -- GOVERNORS DO NOT HAVE THAT LUXURY. I ASKED THE LEADER OF THE FORTUNE 500 GALLONSCOMPANY TO GET SOME TOP BUSINESS PEOPLE TOGETHER. I WANTED US TO LOOK AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. IT WAS THE FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER I SIGNED TO AUTHORIZE THEM TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEM. I WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE SYSTEM WAS COLD AND FOG. I WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO BE MORE CAPITAL WITH THE TAXPAYER MONEY. -- I WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE SYSTEM WAS ANTIQUATED AND FLAWED. WE GOT OUR STATE TO THE POINT WHERE BROWN UNIV. IT SAID WE HAVE BECOME THE MOST SOPHISTICATED STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN DEALING WITH INTERNET TECHNOLOGY. OUR STATE WAS ESSENTIALLY OPEN 24/7, 3 AND 65 DAYS PER YEAR. YOU COULD DO ANYTHING ONLINE THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED TO GO TO A STATE OFFICE ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE. THAT INCLUDED GETTING A HUNTING LICENSE AND EVEN CHECKING YOUR DEAR ONLINE. SOME PEOPLE DID NOT ACTUALLY GET ONE, THEY DETECTED ON LINE TO MAKE IT LOOK AT IT. -- THEY JUST CHECKED IT ON MINE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY DID. [LAUGHTER] THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD FUNCTION LIKE THAT. FAMILY FRIEND THELY PRACTICES WERE PRIORITIZED. MOTHERS AND FATHERS ULTIMATELY WILL RAISE THEIR CHILDREN THAN THE GOVERNMENT WILL. WE SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE THE FAMILY. IT IS THE KEY TO MAKING SURE THERE IS CONTINUITY FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT. THAT PROVIDES FOR THERE TO BE A STABLE ECONOMY. WE CANNOT DISCUSS THE ECONOMY WITHOUT TOUCHING ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH. I DID NOT SAY HEALTH CARE. WE DO NOT HAVE THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE A HEALTH CRISIS. WE SPEND 70% OF OUR GDP ON HEALTH CARE. 80% OF THAT MONEY GOES TO DEAL WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. IT COULD BE PREVENTED OR CURED IF WE WERE HEALTHIER. THE ENTIRE HEALTH CRISIS DEBATE CENTERS AROUND ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT QUALITY. THE REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE NO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE HAVE A DISEASE CARE SYSTEM. WE FOCUS ON INTERVENTION AT THE CATASTROPHIC LEVEL. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION. IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE TO PREVENT AN ILLNESS THAN TRY TO FIX IT ONCE IT IS OUT OF CONTROL. THAT IS THE DIRECTION THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE MOVING [APPLAUSE] IN]. WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR, WE'VE MADE MAJOR CHANGES. NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO SEE HEALTH CARE COSTS RISING AT TWICE THE RACERATE OF INFLATION. YOU CANNOT DO IT WITH A BUSINESS. YOU CANNOT DO AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT EITHER. WE CONTACTED WITH A MICHIGAN COMPANY CALLED HELP MEDLATH ALTH MEDIA. WE FOUND OUT THAT WHEN YOU PUT PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN PLACE, PRODUCTIVITY GOES UP IN A VERY MEASURABLE TERMS. OUR PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED BY ALMOST $2,300 PER PERSON. WE PUT THE FOCUS ON HELPING PEOPLE TO BE WELL, MAINTAINING NORMAL BODY WEIGHT, EXERCISING, NOT SMOKING. THE BASIC THINGS. THESE ARE NOT AS HEALTH ISSUES. THIS IS THE MAJOR ECONOMIC DRIVER IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE WE SPEND IN THE ENTIRE DEFENSE BUDGET, INCLUDING PAYING FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ. OUR GDP IS SO OUT OF PROPORTION OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT IN EVERY OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY, NOBODY SPENDS THAT KIND OF MONEY ON HEALTH CARE. SWEDEN SPENDS 10.5%. THE SAVINGS PER YEAR FOR US WOULD BE $700 BILLION. YOU COULD DO A LOT OF THINGS IN AMERICA WITH THE MONEY. WE CANNOT. WE'RE PAYING FOR PEOPLE TO BE SICK. WE SHOULD TRY TO PUT THE FOCUS ON THEM BEING WELL FED THEIR BASIC PRINCIPLES WE NEED TO CONSIDER. -- WE SHOULD TRY TO PUT THE FOCUS OF THEM BEING WELL. THERE ARE BASIC PRINCIPLES WE NEED TO CONSIDER. WE SHOULD FACILITATE THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM. WE SHOULD NOT PENALIZE PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSIDIZE IRRESPONSIBILITY. THE BEST GOVERNMENT IS THE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS A GOVERNOR, THE LAST THING I WANT IS MORE MANDATES. SOME PEOPLE LOVE THEM. I HATE THEM. WASHINGTON LAST DOES WHAT TO DO BUT NOT GIVE US THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. -- WASHINGTON LOVES TO TELL US WHAT TO DO BUT NOT GIVE US THE MONEY TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] I WOULD REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL REGISTER. THAT IS MONEY COMING OUT OF YOUR POCKET FOR THE COST OF REGULATION. I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THAT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO ALLOW PEOPLE. IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO THE ECONOMISTS. LEADING ECONOMISTS WERE ASKED TO DESIGN AND IDEAL TAX SYSTEM. MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD COME BACK WITH A FLAT TAX. THEY CAME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT IS A FLAT TAX AND IS ALSO FINE AT. IT IS ALSO FAMILY FRIENDLY. WE WOULD TRANSFORM THE TAX SYSTEM FROM ONE WHERE WE TAX PRODUCTIVITY TO TAXING CONSUMPTION. TAXES WOULD BE MOVED TO THE RETAIL LEVEL, AT THE CONSUMPTION LEVEL. THERE WOULD BE NO TAX ON CORPORATE OR PERSONAL INCOME. THERE WOULD BE NO TAX ON INHERITANCE OR CAPITAL GAINS. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EARN WEALTH. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO WORK HARDER AND INVEST. WE WOULD NOT DISCOURAGE THEM. IT COULD BE THAT THE $10 TRILLION CAPITAL PARKED OFFSHORE TO PROTECT IT FROM THE TAX SYSTEM -- WHAT HAPPENED THAT CAME BACK INTO THE ECONOMY AS CAPITAL INVESTMENT? WHEN DIVINIZE IF AMERICA BECAME THE TAX HAVEN OF THE WORLD -- WOULD NOT IT BE NICE IF AMERICA BECAME THE TAX EVEN OF THE WORLD? INSTEAD OF SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COMPLY WITH THE TAX CODE, THAT MONEY COULD GO BACK INTO YOUR BUSINESS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, CREATING BETTER PRODUCTS. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS DID NOT HAVE THE EMBEDDED 22% TAX IN THEIR PRODUCTS? THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH EUROPEANS WITHOUT IT. THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN IF AMERICANS HAD A PLAYING FIELD THAT WAS LEVELED -- THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN MICHIGAN IF AMERICANS HAD A PLAYING FIELD THAT WAS LEVEL. IT IS NOT THAT WAY NOW. IT IS DIFFICULT TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO DUMP THEIR PRODUCTS IN OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT THE SAME TAX SYSTEM. IT WOULD INCREASE OUR GDP BY OVER 10% THE FIRST YEAR. IT WOULD INCREASE OUTPUT. REAL WAGES WOULD INCREASE BY 8%. WE WOULD NOT HAVE AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. EVERYONE WOULD BE ON THE BOOKS. A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL ME POPULIST AND OTHER THINGS. MY GOAL IS NOT TO MAKE RICH PEOPLE POOR. IT IS TO MAKE IT SO THAT POOR PEOPLE HAVE A SHOT AT THE AMERICAN DREAM AND MAY BE BECOMING RICH THEMSELVES. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE WAY AMERICA SHOULD WORK FOR EVERYBODY. [APPLAUSE] THE GOAL OF GOVERNMENT IS ONLY TO BE THE REFEREE. IT SHOULD MAKE TO THE RULES ARE FOLLOWED. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO PUT ON THE JERSEY AND GET IN THE GAME AND TRY TO TAKE THE BALL. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT THINKS ITS PRIMARY JOB IS TO PICK THE WINNERS AND LOSERS, IN SOME OF US ARE GOING TO BE PICKED TO BE LOSERS. THE CURRENT TAX SYSTEM IS A GAME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT PICKS THE WINNERS AND THE LOSERS BY MANIPULATING THE TAX CODE. WITH A SIMPLE TAX CODEA SIMPLE TAX CODE WOULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE GAME. MICHIGAN COULD BE THE CENTERPIECE OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING. WE COULD REVIVE THE AMERICAN SPIRIT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY. IT HELPS PEOPLE FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP. IT HELPS EVERYONE FROM THE RICHEST TO THE POOREST. PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHAT MY CAMPAIGN HAS DONE WHAT IT HAS DONE WITHOUT A LOT OF MONEY. SOME PEOPLE SAY IT IS THE EVANGELICAL VOTE. I DO HOPE THEY WILL BE WITH ME. ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT EVANGELICALS, PARTICULARLY THE BAAPTISTS, IS THAT THEY WILL BE DIVIDED. [LAUGHTER] THEY ARE ALL ACTIVE IN MY CAMPAIGN. AFTER FOR ME AND HALF ARE AGAINST ME. THAT IS ABOUT ALL I CAN SAY. I BELIEVE THE REASON WE HAVE TOUCHED A NERVE IS BECAUSE I'M TALKING ABOUT POLICIES THAT DO NOT PENALIZE THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP. BUT THEY ALSO GIVE HOPES AND DREAMS TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BOTTOM. I CAME FROM THOSE PEOPLE. I FEEL I MUST BE THE VOICE FOR THEM. IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO BE AGAINST PEOPLE MAKING A PROFIT. I WANT THEM TO MAKE A LOT OF IT. CAPITAL IS NOT LIGHT. THERE IS NOT A LIMITED AMOUNT. -- CAPITAL IS NOT FINITE. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR GROWTH IN THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM. THE REASON I'M THE FIRST REPUBLICAN IN ONE OF THE 19 YEARS TO GET THE ENDORSEMENT -- THE REASON I AM THE FIRST REPUBLICAN IN 119 YEARS TO GET THE ENDORSEMENT OF SEVERAL UNIONS -- I GOT THE ENDORSEMENT TODAY OF THE PAINTERS' UNION. THAT WILL SCARE SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS. BUT IT SHOULD NOT. IT SHOULD MAKE THEM EXCITED THAT OUR PARTY HAS FINALLY RECOGNIZED THAT WE'RE ONE AMERICA. WE ARE A UNITED STATES. WE MUST REMAIN THAT WAY. WE MUST FIGHT SO THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE COMPANY OR THE PERSON HELPING TO MAKE THE PRODUCTS OF THE COMPANY PROSPER TOGETHER. ANYTHING LESS THAN THEAT AND AND WE CANNOT BE THE CREATION THAT WE ONCE WERE. A MAN WAS ONCE IN A TAVERN LATE NIGHT. HE LOST TRACK OF THE TIME. HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE WITH HIS WIFE. HE TOOK A SHORTCUT HOME THAT HE KNEW. IT HAPPENS TO BE THROUGH A CEMETERY. IT WAS DARK THAT NIGHT. HE DID NOT SEE THE FRESHLY DUG GRAVE IN FRONT OF HIM. HE FELL RIGHT INTO IT. HE CLAWED AND CLIMBED. HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE GRAVE. HE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING. HE CRAWLED UP AND WENT TO SLEEP. A FEW MINUTES LATER IN THE SAME TAVERN, ANOTHER MAN REALIZED THE SAME THING. HE JUMPED UP AND TO THE SAME SHORT CUT THROUGH THE CEMETERY. HE DID NOT SEE THE OPEN GRAVE. HE FELL RIGHT INTO IT AS WELL. HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO GET OUT. HE COULD NOT. HE WAS READY TO GIVE UP AND WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING. WHEN SUDDENLY, OUT OF THE DARKNESS, A HAND REACHED OUT AND GRABBED HIM BY THE SHOULDER. A DEEP VOICE TOLD HIM HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF THERE. BUT HE DID. [LAUGHTER] WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT WE CANNOT RESTORE THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA, THAT WE CANNOT REFORM THE TAX SYSTEM, I SAY IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHO IS WITH YOU DOWN THERE IN THAT GRAVE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE CAN DO ANYTHING. WE SHOULD DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. IT IS PART OF OUR TRADITION HERE. I HAVE A QUESTION FROM A STUDENT. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT QUALITY IS SET TO APART FROM THE OTHER CANDIDATES. >> IT IS CERTAINLY NOT MY GOOD LOOKS. I THINK IT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING RUN A GOVERNMENT LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. I DID IT WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE JOB IS NOT ABOUT TRYING TO PICK WHAT WILL BE BEST FOR ME POLITICALLY. IT IS TO DO THE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE WILL HELP OUR STATE. PEOPLE LOOK AT MY RECORD. THEY MAY THINK I SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF SOME THINGS. I AM PROUD OF THEM. A GOVERNMENT WITH A VIEW TOWARDS THE NEXT GENERATION INSTEAD OF THE NEXT ELECTION. IT HAD GOVERNED WITH A VIEW TOWARDS THE NEXT GENERATION INSTEAD OF THE NEXT ELECTION. I ALWAYS ASK MYSELF EVERY DAY WHAT I WAS DOING THAT DAY TO HELP THE YOUNG CHILD IN A POOR AREA. I WANTED TO DO WHAT I COULD TO HELP HIM HAVE THE HOPE FOR A BETTER LIFE. IF I DID NOT COME UP WITH SOMETHING WE HAD DONE THAT DAY, WE HAVE FAILED. I THINK THAT IS THE QUALITY PEOPLE LOOK FOR ANY PRESIDENT. YOU DO NOT WANT PROTECTION. YOU CANNOT AFFORD IT AND YOU CANNOT FIND IT. -- USE DO NOT WANT PERFECTION -- YOU CANNOT AFFORD IT AND YOU CANNOT FIND IT. NO ONE EVER STUBBED THEIR TOE STANDING STILL. I DO NOT WANT TO STAND STILL. THAT IS HOW I WOULD LEAD. >> HOW DID YOU ACHIEVE SUCH SUCCESS IN ARKANSAS IN TERMS OF EDUCATION. HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE ""NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND""? >> THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT FINALLY TREATED STUDENTS AS INDIVIDUALS. A LOT OF KIDS WERE GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THEY WERE GRADUATING FUNCTIONALLY ILLITERATE AND NO ONE CAUGHT IT. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE STARTED TREATING STUDENTS INDIVIDUALLY. THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT WE PUT A FOCUS ON THE FEW AREAS. WE TESTED DOESN'T HELP PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. THAT IS WHY WE LOST A LOT OF THE EXTENDED CURRICULUM. -- WE TESTED THOSE HAND-HELD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. PARTY CADRES ARE NOT THE TWO PRIMARY FACTORS IN WHETHER SOMEONE WILL GRADUATE. -- POVERTY AND RACE ARE NOT THE TWO PRIMARY FACTORS IN WHETHER SOMEONE WILL GRADUATE. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THE CURRICULUM. IF YOU CAN INTEREST THE STUDENT, YOU IMPROVE THE CHANCES THAT THEY WILL FINISH THEIR EDUCATION. THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION REFORM ARE ABOUT RAISING INSTEAD OF LOWERING THE STANDARDS. YOU DO NOT LOWER THE BASKETBALL GOLD IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE GAME. YOU KEEP THE STANDARDS HIGH. YOU MAKE THEM PRACTICE HARDER UNTIL THEY CAN HIT THE GOAL. YOU RAISE THE STANDARDS. YOU HAVE A REALISTIC MEASURING SYSTEM. YOU HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE SYSTEMS. IF PEOPLE ARE NOT PERFORMING, THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. WE PASSED A TOUGH BILL IN ARKANSAS. IF SCHOOLS FAILED TO YEARS IN A ROW, WE COULD LITERALLY GO IN AND FIRE EVERYONE AND TAKE OVER THE SCHOOLS. NO ONE THOUGHT WE WOULD DO IT, BUT WE DID IT. WE WENT IN AND FIRED SCHOOL BOARDS AND SUPERINTENDENTS. [APPLAUSE] YOU WILL NOT WIN FRIENDS, BUT YOU WILL INFLUENCE PEOPLE WHEN YOU DO THOSE THINGS. WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW OUR TAX MONEY TO BE WASTED AND OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES AND WASTED BY HAVING SCHOOLS THAT FAIL TO EDUCATE. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE AN AUTOMOBILE FACTORY THAT COULD NOT PRODUCE A CAR. YOU WOULD NOT. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A SCHOOL THAT CANNOT PRODUCE STUDENTS THAT CAN READ, WRITE, AND BE ABLE TO FUNCTION IN OUR CULTURE? >> WE HAVE ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST FRESH WATER RESOURCES AND AROUND THE GREAT LAKES. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO PROTECT THEM? >> I WOULD NOT LET ANYONE ELSE THIS UNTIL I GOT TO DO ALL OF MINE. [LAUGHTER] I AM AN AVID FISHERMAN. WE'RE VERY MUCH TIED TO OUR ECOSYSTEMS. WE MUST BE CONSERVATIONISTS. I'M NOT AN ENVIRONMENTALIST, BUT I M TO COVER A CONSERVATIONIST. IT IS NOT OURS TO DO WHAT WE WANT WITH. IS OURS TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE AND PASS ON. IT IS THE OLD BOY SCOUT ROLE ABOUT LEAVING YOUR CAMPSITE BETTER THAN IT WAS WHEN YOU FOUND IT. SURELY, WE CAN AGREE THAT IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE THE NEXT GENERATION AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER AN ENVIRONMENT THAN WE HAVE HAD. CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, CLEAN SOIL, A GOOD ENVIRONMENT IS TANTAMOUNT TO RESPONSIBLE CITIZENSHIP. EVERYTHING WE SHOULDDO SHOULD ENHANCE THE ECOSYSTEM. OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF OUR LIVES. >> THERE IS ONE QUESTION FROM A STUDENT THAT I WILL INPUTEND WITH. THE BEATLES OR THE ROLLING STONES? [LAUGHTER] >> THAT IS TOUGH. THE BEATLES WERE THE GREATEST INNOVATORS BECAUSE THEY STARTED IT. THE ROLLING STONES HAVE THE LASTING POWER. AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS AND EVEN THE KEITH RICHARDS HAS PROBABLY BEEN DEAD FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND DOES NOT KNOW IT, [LAUGHTER] THAT CONTINUE TO MAKE THE MOST AMAZING MUSIC AND SHOWS. I ACTUALLY HARDENED KEITH RICHARDS -- I ACTUALLY GAVE A PARDON TO KEITH RICHARDS. HE AND ANOTHER MUSICIAN PASSED THROUGH THE STATE. I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT. THEY PULLED OVER IN A SMALL TOWN. THIS WAS 1975. MEN WITH LONG HAIR DID NOT LOOK RIGHT IN THAT AREA. SOMEONE CALLED THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT CAME UP AND TOOK A LOOK AT THEM. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD BEEN WEAVING ON THE ROAD. AMAZINGLY, THEY DID NOT FIND ANY DRUGS. THERE WERE ABLE TO GET HIM FOR RECKLESS DRIVING. HE SAID HE WAS CHANGING THE RADIO CHANNEL. THEY PUT HIM IN JAIL. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOWED UP BECAUSE THE ROLLING STONES HAVE NEVER BEEN TO ARKANSAS BEFORE. IT WAS NOT EXACTLY THE WAY THEY INTENDED TO TOWARD THE STATE. WE FINALLY GET THE ROLLING STONES TO ARKANSAS AND WE THROW THEM IN JAIL. IN THE SPRING OF 2006, THEY HAD A CONCERT IN LITTLE ROCK. THE KEYBOARD PLAYER IS A FRIEND OF MINE. HE IS ALSO A GREAT CONSERVATIONIST. HE HAS A TREE FARM IN GEORGIA. HE GOT ME BACKSTAGE TO MEET THE BAND AND VISIT WITH EVERYBODY. I WAS BACKSTAGE TALKING TO ALL OF THEM. I WAS VISITING WITH KEITH RICHARDS. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN TO ARKANSAS BEFORE. [LAUGHTER] I TOLD HIM THAT I KNEW. HE ASKED IF I KNEW THE SHERIFF IN THE TOWN. I SAID THAT I DID. HE TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN THROWN INTO JAIL THERE. I TOLD HIM THAT I KNEW THAT. HE WAS TELLING THE STORY. I TOLD THEM I COULD DO SOMETHING FOR HIM THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD DO. I TOLD HIM THAT I COULD GIVE HIM A PARDON. I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON EARTH WHO COULD DO THAT FOR HIM. HE HAD PAID THE FINE YEARS AGO. IT WAS STILL ON HIS RECORD. I TOLD HIM I COULD GIVE HIM A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH IN ARKANSAS. [LAUGHTER] I STARTED THE PAPERWORK. IT IS A LONG PROCESS. IT TOOK ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO GET IT DONE. BY LAST MONTH IN OFFICE, ASI WAS ABLE TO GET COMPLETED. AND IS ABLE TO PRESENT HIM WITH A PARDON FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. A REPORTER ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT THAT WAS RIGHT. HE WAS ASKING IF IT WAS SPECIAL TREATMENT OR IF I WOULD DO IT FOR ANYBODY. I SAID THAT I WOULD NOT, UNLESS THEY COULD PLAY GUITAR AS WELL AS KEITH RICHARDS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] >> GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. I WAS WATCHING THE AUDIENCE. EVERYONE WAS RIVETED.

WHICH HOLDS THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY THIS SATURDAY. >> GOOD JOB OF THE COMMON GOOD JUDGE. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE DROUGHT IS OVER, THE VOTE FOR MCCAIN. WE NEED THE RAIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING YAKIMA SORRY ABOUT THE WEATHER BUT HONEST TO GOD WE DO NEED THE RAIN, THANK YOU GOOD LORD COME TO KEEP THAT. NOW WE NEED THE FULL TOTAL PACKAGE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THE COMPLETE PACKAGE, NOT ONE PART OF IT, ALL OF THAT, THE FISCAL CONSERVATISM RIGHT? LISTEN TO MY FRIEND TOM COBURN IN A MINUTE BUT I AM NOT THROUGH YET. TAX-CUTTING CONSERVATISM. JACK KEMP, HE KNOWS THAT STUFF. SOCIAL CONSERVATISM. TAKING CARE OF OUR FAMILIES, STANDING UP FOR LIFE. [CHEERING] BUT AS IMPORTANT AS ANYTHING WE NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO IS READY TO GO DAY ONE. [CHEERING] WE HAVE THAT TO -- WITH A FINE PEOPLE RUNNING BUT WE HAVE GOT THE TOTAL PACKAGE. SOUTH CAROLINA STANDS IN A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE PRIMARY FIELD AND IT ALWAYS HAS. IT IS A BURDEN WE CARRIED HERE, AN OPPORTUNITY WE OWN, BECAUSE IF YOU WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AFTER YOU WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN'T WIN A GRAND SLAM WITHOUT THE MASTERS. NEW HAMPSHIRE IT IS THE MASTERS. THIS IS THE U.S. OPEN. [CHEERING] NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID, THERE IS A LOT BEING SAID THAT THEY ARE ON PHONE CALLS IN THE MAIL, THERE IS A BUNCH OF GARBAGE, IGNORE IT. WE KNOW THE TRUTH. THE PEOPLE UP HERE STANDING BEHIND JOHN AND HAVE KNOWN JOHN FOR A LONG TIME, HIS BUDDIES WHO SERVED WITH HIM IN A NORTH VIETNAMESE PRISON, THEY ARE ALL OVER THIS DAY, ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY SAYING HE IS ONE OF THE BRAVEST MEN THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN AND THEY WILL VOUCH FOR HIM. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN SOUTH CAROLINA'S POINT TO REJECT THIS GARBAGE AND VOTE FOR THE TRUE FACTS ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN, AN AMERICAN HERO, AN AMERICAN HERO. [CHEERING] I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD WITH THIS MAN, EVERY HOT SPOT, EVERY WORKPLACE SEEKING GO. I AM DUMB ENOUGH TO GO WITH HIM. I HAVE SEEN HIM TALK TO MUSHARRAF IN PAKISTAN ABOUT PUSHING FOR DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO THANKING HIM FOR HELPING US AGAINST THE TALIBAN AND AL QAEDA. I'VE SEEN HIM GO TO ISRAEL, TO THE LEADERSHIP OF ISRAEL AND LET THEM IN THE EYE AND SAY AS LONG AS I AM IN OFFICE, AS LONG AS I'M A SENATOR, WE WILL NEVER ABANDON YOU. YOU ARE OUR ALLIES. WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU TO THE WOLVES OF TERRORISM IS A REAL, WE WILL BE WITH YOU. I SEEN HIM TALK TO PRIME MINISTER ABBAS, LISTENING TO THE HOPES AND DREAMS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. I'VE SEEN HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD GET INSTANT RESPECT FROM WORLD LEADERS. JOHN'S THE WORLD BUT MORE BORDELAIS, THE WORLD KNOWS JOHN. [APPLAUSE] HOW MANY VETERANS HAVE WE GOT HERE? ALRIGHT, YOU HAVE GOT HIS BACK. I'VE BEEN TO IRAQ MANY TIMES AND MOST OF THE TIMES I'VE GONE WITH JOHN AND IT IS A PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO TRAVEL WITH HIM BECAUSE THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM SEE HIM, THEY ARE DRAWN LIKE A MAGNET. THEY WANT THEIR PHOTO BECAUSE THEY KNOW HE IS IN THEIR SHOES, THEY KNOW HE UNDERSTANDS THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEY ADMIRED HIM. IT IS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD THE ONE THING AND WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU THE ABOVE ALL ELSE, WE NEED LEADERS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WILL DO THINGS NECESSARY FOR THE GOOD OF US ALL, EVEN IF THAT MIGHT CAUSE THEM. REMEMBER THIS TOWN LAST YEAR IN IRAQ? EVERY DEMOCRAT SAID THIS WAR IS LOST, IT IS HOPELESS, GET OUT OF IRAQ BUT THEY NEVER TOLD US WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THEY JUST SAID LEAVE. REPUBLICANS WENDOVER AND SAID, THE WAR IS GOING GOOD, IT IS JUST THE MEDIA'S FAULT. BOTH WERE WRONG. JOHN WENDOVER KNEW WAS BROKEN THE MOST IMPORTUNING YOU HAD A FIX-IT AND HE DID. THANK GOD JOHN MCCAIN CALLED FOR A NEW STRATEGY. [APPLAUSE] HE GOT BEAT UP, HE GOT BEAT THAT BUT HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT. TALKING ABOUT IRAQ SENDING MORE TROOPS AFTER IMMIGRATION WAS NOT THE SMART THING TO DO POLITICALLY, BUT IT SURE WAS THE NECESSARY THING TO DO. I WAS IN THE ROOM LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WHEN HE WAS TOLD IF YOU GO DOWN THIS ROAD, WITH THESE POLLS YOUR CAREER IS OVER. WITH NOBODY AROUND HE SAID, I WOULD RATHER THIS A CAMPAIGN THAN TO LOSE THIS WAR. [CHEERING] WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE THIS WAR. THE DEMOCRATS WERE WRONG, JOHN MCCAIN WAS RIGHT, JOHN EDWARDS CALL THAT THE MCCAIN SURGE. HE DON'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. THE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WE HAVE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT THAT IS THE TOTAL PACKAGE AND NEVER WILL YOU BE PREPARED FOR THIS JOB HE HAS PREPARED. YES SACRIFICE, YES DEBORAH FOR OUR COUNTRY, USED IN WILLING TO DIE FOR COUNTRY. HE HAS A 19-YEAR-OLD SON WHO IS THE MARINE CORPS ""FOR ALL COMMON WAS THAT THE NAVAL ACADEMY. HE WILL NOT ASK ANYTHING OF ANYBODY ELSE FAMILY HE IS NOT ASKING OF HIS OWN. THIS IS A TIME FOR JOHN MCCAIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND WE HAVE TO SEND A REPUBLICAN WHO CAN WIN IN NOVEMBER. THIS IS THE MAN WHO CAN WIN. WE NEED A CONSERVATIVE -- [APPLAUSE] THE NEXT PERSON I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE COMES FROM OKLAHOMA. HE DOES NOT HAVE AN ACCENT. JACK KEMP DOES. TOM COBURN IS EVERYTHING THAT IS RIGHT ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE. HE IS EVERYTHING YOU WOULD HOPE TO HAVE ANY PUBLIC SERVANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND DO THE HARD THINGS. REMEMBER THE BRIDGE TO NOWHERE? $233 MILLION, FOR 50 PEOPLE? IT WAS HIS AMENDMENT. HE GOT 13 VOTES. I WAS PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE 13, SO WAS JIM DEMINT. WE HAVE THAT VOTE NOW WE GET 95. TOM COBURN HAS STOOD UP AND USED ENCOUNTERED. HE IS HERE TODAY TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED FOR JOHN MCCAIN, A WARM WELCOME FOR SENATOR TOM COBURN. [APPLAUSE] .. OUR FUTURE IS OUR CHILDREN. AND THE HOPES AND JAMES WE DID NOT MANIFEST AND OURSELVES WE HOPE TO MANIFEST IN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN. AND TO DO THAT, TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN TO BE THE SHINING CITY UPON A HELL REQUIRES CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY AND LEADERSHIP. AND MY ENTIRE EXPERIENCE IN WASHINGTON I HAVE FOUND AN INDIVIDUAL WHO I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH BUT I HAVE FOUND THE QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP THAT I KNOW WERE MANIFESTED IN THE GREATEST LEADER THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN. AND THAT'S CONSTANCY OF PURPOSE. INTEGRITY, HONESTY, THE WILLINGNESS TO WHAT IS RIGHT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE COST IS. AND OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WE FACE AS A NATION BOTH INTERNATIONALLY IN TERMS OF THE WAR OF TERROR AND DOMESTICALLY AND IN TERMS OF THE TREMENDOUS COSTS WE'RE GOING TO FACE IN THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN, THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO IS OUT THERE TODAY OFFERING THEMSELVES TO BE PRESIDENT THAT HAS THE CAPABILITY AND WRITER AND INTEGRITY AND HAS THE CHARACTER TO LEAD THIS NATION IN THE TREMENDOUS THINGS WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING. THERE'S NOT ONE PROBLEM WE CAN'T SOLVE. BUT WHO WE CHOOSE TO LEAVE US AND THE CHARACTER THAT THEY DISPLAY WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD ON WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL. THAT MAN IS JOHN MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HIM. NOT A PERSON WHO IS THE MINISTER THAT TYPE OF CHARACTER IS GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU NEXT. HE REPRESENTS REAL REPUBLICAN AS SOME AND WHAT THAT THIS IS KNOWING THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE SMALL AND EFFICIENT AND SHOULDN'T BE WASTING 20% OF EVERYTHING IT DOES. BUT THE SAME TIME WE NEVER FORGET THOSE WHO ARE LESS FORTUNATE MAKING SURE WE ARE OFFERING A HAND TO HELP THOSE WHO WANT TO HELP THEMSELVES. IF THAT PERSON IS JACK KEMP. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE, TAKE YOUR SEATS. [LAUGHTER] FIRST STANDING OVATION ATTACK AND A LONG TIME, JOHN. LIKE MANY AMERICANS, I HADN'T MADE UP MY MIND UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO. I KNOW ALL OF THE CANDIDATES. I'VE A GOOD REPUBLICAN. I COME FROM THE REAGAN WAY AS DOES JOHN. I WAS SITTING WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME AS YOU WOULD EXPECT JACK KEMP AND OLD QUARTERBACK. THOSE WATCHING THE GIANTS PLAY THE TAMPA BAY BUCS. AND THERE ONE. I DON'T NEW YORK AND ALL OF THAT POPULAR IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I WAS CHEERING FOR THE GIANTS. AND THEY WANT. THE ONE. BUT I SAID, MY WIFE WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME WATCHING THE GAME, SAID JOANNE, I CANNOT SIT THIS OUT. OF A QUARTERBACK. I'M SUPPOSED TO LEAD. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES WITH GREAT DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE MADE. I SAID I WANT A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO COMES FROM THE GREATEST GENERATION. JOHN MCCAIN'S GRANDFATHER, HIS FATHER HIMSELF, THIS IS THE GREATEST GENERATION BECAUSE EVERY GENERATION HAS TO BE A GREAT GENERATION AND JOHN MCCAIN CAN MAKE THIS COUNTRY AS GREAT AS IT CAN BE. [APPLAUSE] RONALD REAGAN HAD A GREAT LINE ONETIME BUT THE DEMOCRATS. HE SAID IF ANYTHING MOVES TO WANT TO TAX IT, IF IT KEEPS MOVING THEY WILL REGULATE IT AND IF IT STOPS MOVING THEY WILL SUBSIDIZE IT. [LAUGHTER] JOHN UNDERSTAND IF YOU TAX SOMETHING YOU GET LESS OF IT, IF HE SUBSIDIZES OF THE YOU GET MORE AND ALL TOO OFTEN WE TAX WORK, SAVINGS, INVESTMENT CALLED ON JAPAN REAL SHIP, HARD WORK AND SUBSIDIZE CONSUMPTION, THAT, LEISURE, WELFARE, ETC.. HE WANTS TO REMOVE THE TAX BURDEN TO GET THIS ECONOMY SO IT DOESN'T ENTER A RECESSION THREE EVERYBODY ELSE IS TALKING ABOUT A STIMULUS. JOHN WANTS A LONG-TERM PRO GROWTH TAX REFORM AND I'M GOING TO HELP HIM. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I WENT TO CONGRESS IN 1970, THEY ASKED ME TO GET INTO ALL PERSPECTIVE OF THIS. WHEN I WENT TO CONGRESS IN 1976 FROM THE BUFFALO BILLS I RETIRED IN 1970. PEOPLE LIVE IN BUFFALO THOUGHT I QUIT PLAYING AND 65 PREFERABLY RETIRED IN 1973 THE TOP TAX RATE IN AMERICA, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER, THE TOP TAX RATE WAS 70%. THE CAPITOL GAINS TAX WAS 50%. THE COUNTRY WAS STILL FIGHT, IT WASN'T GROWING. REAGAN CAME INTO OFFICE IN 1983 WE CUT TAX RATES ACROSS THE BOARD OF CAPITAL GAINS AND ON CORPORATE INCOME. TODAY, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS THE HIGHEST CORPORATE INCOME TAX IN THE WORLD, SAVE JAPAN THE RATE THEY ARE HIGHER, THEY ARE IN A RECESSION. PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SLOWDOWN. TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLE RECESSION. JOHN MCCAIN THOSE WE CAN PREVENT A RECESSION. IT ISN'T PREDICTABLE, IT ISN'T NECESSARY AND THANKS TO JOHN MCCAIN WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS ECONOMY GROWING UP THE FULL LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] HE'S GOING TO OUTLINE SOME IDEAS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T ENTER INTO A RECESSION, HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS ECONOMY GROW AND DON'T FORGET, FOLKS, TO LIMIT SPENDING AND HAVE A GROWING ECONOMY IS THE VERY BEST WAY TO GET MORE REVENUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT. I'M GOING TO END WITH ' OF JOHN F. KENNEDY. I USED TO DRIVE THEM CRAZY BUT HE GAVE A GREAT SPEECH IN 1970 AND SAID IT IS A PARADOXICAL TRUTH HIGH TAX RATES CAUSE LOWER TAX REVENUES AND THE BEST WAY TO GET MORE REVENUE IS CUT DOWN ON THE TAX RATE AND LET THE ECONOMY GROW. THAT IS THE MCCAIN MESSAGE. WE ARE CLOSER TO KENNEDY THAN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY'VE RUN AWAY FROM IT. THEY ARE ANTI-BUSINESS, ANTI-LABOR. THEY DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT EVEN DEMOCRATIC. AFTER, EXCITED TO BE IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. WHILE MOST SAID A KID, THAT'S WHERE WE WERE THIS MORNING. I WAS HERE WITH RONALD REAGAN, BOB DOLE MYSELF, JOHN MCCAIN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I'M GOING TO GIVE THE MICROPHONE TO HIS DEAR WIFE, HIS PARTNER, CINDY. >> THANK YOU. I WILL BE VERY BRIEF. IF WE WERE IN ARIZONA I WOULD GO UNDER A COUPLE -- GROUND FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. LET ME INTRODUCE OUR DAUGHTER, MEGHAN MCCAIN WHO IS WITH US. SEES A RECENT GRADUATE FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND HAS REMAINED CONSERVATIVE AND HAS RUN EIGHT DELIGHTFUL BLOG. I SUGGEST ALL OF THESE PEOPLE UP HERE WILL TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS DONE AND WHERE HE WILL GO AS PRESIDENT. I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MAN. THERE'S A LOT THAT SOMEONE CAN SAY BUT WHEN YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED AS LONG AS WE HAVE, 28 YEARS WE HAD OUR THREE KIDS INITIALLY. I LIVED OUT IN ARIZONA, JOHN COMMUTED HOME EVERY WEEKEND. WE NEVER LIVED IN WASHINGTON. WITH SALT LAKE LIVING AT HOME AND RAISING THEM AT HOME WITH A BETTER IDEA FOR OUR CHILDREN. IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR US. I STUMBLED UPON A LITTLE GIRL IN BANGLADESH AND MOTHER TERESA'S ORPHANAGE HAVE A CLEFT PALATE AND PROBLEMS WITH HER FEET AND HANDS AND ALL KIND OF THINGS. AS ONLY MOTHER TERESA CAN-DO SHE PREVAILED UPON ME TO BRING HER HOME TO GET SOME MEDICAL CARE, SHE NEEDED IT DESPERATELY. AND I REALIZED ALL THE WAY HOME ON THE FLIGHT FROM BANGKOK TO LOS ANGELES, I COULDN'T GIVE THIS LITTLE GIRL UP. SHE HAD CHOSEN THE ONE PART OF THIS YOU DON'T KNOW IS MY HUSBAND DIDN'T KNOW. [LAUGHTER] I STEPPED OFF THE PLATE IN LOS ANGELES, WENT ON TO PHOENIX. MY HUSBAND WAS THERE TO MEET WITH A LOT OF CAMERAS CAUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE LOOKED DOWN AT ME AND SAID WHERE IS SHE THE ONE TO GO AND I SAID I THOUGHT SHE WOULD GO TO OUR HOUSE AND HE JUST SMILED HER AND WELCOME PURCHASED LIKE HE SHOULD HAVE. WHAT THAT TELLS HE IS A REMARKABLE MAN WITH AN OPEN HEART. HE PUTS HIS FAMILY FIRST WHICH IS WHAT I BELIEVE MAKES THE MAN. AND WITH THAT SAID I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MY HUSBAND. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

BY THE WAY YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD BUT SHE'S OF THE CHILD. SHE HAS INJURED HER KNEE SOME TIME AGO WHILE SHOPPING. AND SHE IS MUCH BETTER NOW. AND MY DAUGHTER, MEGHAN, WHO IS WITH US WHO SHE MENTIONED GRADUATED FROM THE CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT AND ACTION, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND BY THE WAY, ANY OF YOU THAT NO OF JOB OPENINGS FOR ART HISTORY MAJORS, PLEASE SEE ME AFTER THIS. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. MY MOM, SHE ASKED IF MY MOM WAS YOUR OF THE LAST TRIP AS YOU KNOW, SHE'S 95. I TRY TO TAKE HER WITH ME WHEREVER I GO. SHE IS NOW TRAVELING. BUT SHE CAUGHT LAST CHRISTMAS, WANTED TO DRIVE AROUND FRANCE. SO SHE LANDED IN PARIS AND WENT TO RENT A CAR AND THEY SAID SHE WAS TOO OLD SO SHE BOUGHT ONE AND DROVE AROUND FRANCE.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVELY WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE. THANK YOU FOR EVERY DAY YOU DO IN OUR COMMUNITY. I'M HONORED TO KNOW YOU. SPEAKER BOBBY HAROLD, WHAT CAN I SAY? A GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP. THE CHORE -- TORCH IS GOING TO BE PASSED. AND IF ANYBODY WANTS A PORK-BARREL PROJECT, PLEASE SEE BOBBY AFTER THIS GATHERING TO THE TIME SURE HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU. AND OUR BELOVED ATTORNEY GENERAL, HENRY MACK MASTER, THANK YOU HAD THREE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS I SET ABOUT HIS RE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST PROUD ABOUT BYE FRIENDS IN A SERIES OF SERIOUSNESS HE IS LEADING SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE NATION AND COMBATING THIS TERRIBLE EVIL WHICH HAS SET US THROUGH THE INTERNET CALLED INTERNET CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. THANK YOU, HENRY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND PROTECTING SOUTH CAROLINA AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. HE JUST ARRESTED THE 109th PERSON GUILTY OF THIS KIND OF TERRIBLE AND EVIL BEHAVIOR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HONORED I AM TO BE WITH DR. COLBURN. HE IS A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. HE'S DELIVERED THOUSANDS OF BABIES. HE IS OUR MORAL STRENGTH AND COMPASS AND GUIDE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HE IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE MOST POWERFUL MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE PORK-BARREL LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTEREST, VIA DEPUE I'M PROUD TO KNOW HIM. I AM PROUD TO FOLLOW HIS LEADERSHIP. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, IF WE ARE ABLE TO STOP THIS PORK-BARREL SPENDING, WHICH WE WILL, WHICH WE WELL, THIS MAN WILL BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE REWRITE HISTORY OF AMERICA. AND BY THANK YOU, TOM, FOR DOING THAT. JACK KEMP, JACK KEMP WHEN OF THE LEADERS IN THE REAGAN REVOLUTION. I WAS A FOOT SOLDIER. JACK KEMP YOU MAY REMEMBER ABOUT THE CAB TAX CUTS AND HIS ADVOCACY FOR PRO-GROWTH AND AGREED THE ECONOMY AND CUTTING TAXES TO UNLEASHING THE POWER AND IMAGINATION OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY AND OF THE ABORTION. JACK, I VERY GRATEFUL YOU ARE HERE. SO THANKS AGAIN, JACK FOR EVERYTHING. NOW I GET FOR A MOMENT TO THAT LITTLE JERK, LINDSEY GRAHAM. [LAUGHTER] FIRST OF ALL, HE'S A LAWYER, AS YOU KNOW. [LAUGHTER] DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LAWYER AND A CATFISH? ONE IS A SCUM SUCKING BOTTOM DWELLER AND THE OTHER IS A FISH. [LAUGHTER] I AM PROUD, I AM PROUD, I AM PROUD MOST SUNDAYS MY TERM ON THE TALK SHOWS AND I SEE LINDSEY GRAHAM I AM PROUD WHEN I PICK UP THE LEADING TO THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES IN THIS COUNTRY AND READ WHAT LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS SAID. WHEN I SEE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE TO OF THE FINEST SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN HISTORY OF OUR SUPREME COURT, JUSTICES ROBERTS AND ALITO IS BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT, SUPPORT THE NOMINATION OF JUDGES WHO STRICTLY INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND DO NOT LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH. THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN COUNT ON. [APPLAUSE] AND MAY I FINALLY SAID I'M PROBABLY MOST PROUD OF HIM BECAUSE HE WEARS THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES COLONEL IN THE AIR FORCE RESERVE. HE IS A LAWYER. LAST AUGUST WHEN THE TEMPERATURE WAS 125 DEGREES IN BAGHDAD, LINDSEY GRAHAM INSTEAD OF CALLING ON VACATION LIKE THE REST OF THE SENATE PUT ON HIS UNIFORM, WENT TO BAGHDAD, SERVED THREE WEEKS TRYING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE GET THE RULE OF LAW WHICH IS A FUNDAMENTAL OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM AND BY THANK YOU, LINDSEY, FOR YOUR SERVICE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] NOT MANY LEGISLATURES IN ATTENDANCE, THERE'S MANY PEOPLE THAT I HAVE NOT HAD A TINTS TO RECOGNIZE EXCEPT TO SAY I NEED YOUR VOTE. I NEEDED. THIS IS A PAVEL ELECTIONS LIMITED YOU KNOW A LOT OF NASTY THINGS ARE GOING ON 384 THAT KIND OF STUFF. I PROMISE YOU I WILL LEAD AMERICA IN THE 21st CENTURY AND MAKE YOU PROUD. I WILL RESTORE YOUR TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT AND LEAD THIS NATION AND THE CHALLENGE AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND THEY WILL NEVER -- WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER, THEY WILL. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I WANT TO TELL A FEW MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY HERE. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE ARE SEEING THE NEWS, WE ARE SEEING THE CONCERNED PEOPLE OUT THERE AND CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SUCH AS MICHIGAN WHERE I JUST CAME FROM WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTIES. THERE ARE PARTS OF THIS STATE YOU CAN ASK BOBBY HERALD OR HANLY OR OTHER PEOPLE IN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATION AND I CAN ASK YOU TO READ THE FACT IS WE HAVE SOME TOUGH TIMES AHEAD BUT I WANT TO LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND REMIND YOU THIS IS STILL THE MOST POWERFUL AND GREATEST NATION ON EARTH. WE'RE THE GREATEST INNOVATOR, EXPORTER, THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE, THE STRONGEST ECONOMY, THE STRONGEST MILITARY, BEACON OF HOPE AND FREEDOM TO EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD. OUR ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS ARE STRONG AND WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS. WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE AMERICA'S GREATEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US ECONOMICALLY, MILITARILY AND OTHERWISE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] SO I HAVE FAITH. I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT WE NEED TO DO SOME THINGS, MY FRIENDS AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT OF THE REASONS WE HAVE THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE IS BECAUSE SPENDING WENT OUT OF CONTROL. ASKED TOM COBURN, HE WILL TELL YOU SPENDING AND GOT OUT OF CONTROL AND WE DID NOT CUT IT AND WE CUT YOUR TAXES AND BY THE WAY, THE FIRST THING WE'VE GOT TO DO FOR EVERY BUSINESS AND FAMILY IN AMERICA IS TO MAKE THESE TAX CUTS PERMANENT SO YOU CAN PLAN ON A BUDGET AND ECONOMY AND HE WILL NOT, AND YOU WILL NOT EXPERIENCE, YOU WILL NOT EXPERIENCE THE EFFECT OF A TAX INCREASE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. AND THE SOONER WE MAKES THOSE TAX CUTS PERMANENT, THE SOONER BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES IN AMERICA WILL BE ABLE TO PLAN AND NOT EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY SEND TO WASHINGTON DC. SWIFT GOT TO MAKE THESE CAP TAX CUT PERMANENT. THERE'S A NOVEL EVIL OUT THERE. TO TAX CUTS AND WHAT IS CALLED THE AMT, THE MINIMUM TAX DESIGNED FOR A HANDFUL OF AMERICANS AND NOW IT HAS REACHED OUT AND 20 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES. THAT THEY MUST BE REPEALED SO THAT NO ONE IN AMERICA IS EXPOSED TO THE ALTERNATE MINIMUM TAX. [APPLAUSE] NOW, NOW, I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO SPENDING, FRIENDS. WE REPUBLICANS CAME TO POWER IN 1994 TO CHANGE GOVERNMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT CHANGED US AND WE LET SPENDING GET OUT OF CONTROL. WHEN REAGAN CAME TO THE PRESIDENCY THE FIRST THING HE SAID WE'VE GOT TO CUT TAXES BUT WE'VE GOT TO CUT SPENDING. IF WE CUT SPENDING UNFORTUNATELY. IN THE YEAR 2001 WE WENT THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. SO WE HAVE TO CUT SPENDING THE. WHAT HAPPENS, WHAT HAPPENS AS TOM COBURN WILL TELL YOU, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW A BILL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT HAD $17 BILLION WORTH, THOUSAND 200 PORK-BARREL EARMARK PROJECT IS. WHERE DOES THAT MONEY GO? THAT MONEY COULD GO FOR A JOB TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR DISPLACED WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN COLUMBIA. IT COULD HELP TRAIN AND REEDUCATE WORKERS DISPLACED BECAUSE OF THE FLIGHT OF THE TAX INDUSTRY OVERSEAS. MY FRIENDS, THAT MONEY COULD BE USED FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS BOBBY HERALD AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ENACTED HERE IN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE IF A NEW BUSINESS IS COMING THEY PROVIDE THE FINDINGS AND TRAINING AND EDUCATION THE TECHNICAL COLLEGES TO PREPARE THE WORKERS THAT THEY WILL BE EMPLOYEES IN THIS NEW BUSINESS. I CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR GOVERNOR FOR THAT PROGRAM. [APPLAUSE] BUT MY FRIEND, WHAT HAPPENS, TOM COBURN WILL TELL YOU IN DISCRIMINATORY SPENDING, THAT IS THE MONEY THAT ARE NOT FIXED SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE OR OTHERS. WE ARE SPENDING ADDITIONAL HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS, $100 BILLION EXTRA THAT CAN BE SAVED. WHAT DO YOU THINK $100 BILLION COULD BE INVESTED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT? PURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY CAN GET BACK IN COMPETITION WITH FOREIGN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS. WHAT YOU THINK IT WOULD DO FOR THE PROGRAMS? BY FRANCE, EVERY TIME WE INCREASED SPENDING AND WASTE YOUR MONEY IT INCREASES YOUR INTEREST RATES. YOU PAY MORE FOR YOUR HOME LOAN MORTGAGE, YOU PAY MORE FOR YOUR AUTOMOBILE LOAN PAYMENTS. YOU PAY MORE AND SO IT'S NOT WITHOUT ANY EFFECT IN WASHINGTON WHEN WE SPEND YOUR TAX DOLLARS FRIVOLOUSLY AND SOMETIMES IN A CORRUPT FASHION. IT AFFECTS THE FAMILIES OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY ABOVE GOING TO STOP IT. I'M GOING TO STOP IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GROWTH. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS GROWTH WE HAVE TO HAVE. I KNOW THIS COUNTRY CAN GROW. I'VE TRAVELED ALL OVER PARIBAS BID TO SILICON VALLEY AND THE NEW BMW PLANT. THAT'S NOT SO NEW. I HAVE BEEN AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND SEE IN THE INNOVATION AND TALENT UNLEASHED BY AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURIAL SEVEN CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS CUT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35 TO 25%. JACK MENTIONED THERE'S ONE IN THE WORLD THAT HAS HIGHER CORPORATE TAX RATES AND WHAT HAPPENS, SOME OF THESE COMPANIES CAN MOVE OVERSEAS WHERE THEY HAVE LOWER TAX RATES AND THEN THE EMPLOYMENT MOVES THERE A BUSINESS AND THE TAX REVENUE MOVES THERE. WE'VE GOT TO CUT THE TAX RATE AND COULD IMMEDIATELY AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO JACK KEMP'S CONTINUED MESSAGE. CUTTING TAXES INCREASES REVENUE. DON'T LISTEN TO THIS SONG ABOUT CUTTING TAXES. EVERY TIME IN HISTORY WE'VE RAISED TAXES IT HAS CUT REVENUES AND IS THEIR ANYBODY HERE THAT NEED TO HAVE THEIR TAXES INCREASED? PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU THINK YOU NEED TO. SO, IT WILL EXPAND OUR ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND IT LEADS TO HIGHER WAGES, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AND OBVIOUSLY ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS AS AVERAGE WORKERS HAVE NOT HAD THEIR INCOME INCREASE AS FAST AS WE WANT TO. CORPORATIONS MAKE MORE MONEY, WORKERS MAKE MORE MONEY, FRIENDS. AND WE NEED TO HAVE A FIRST-YEAR DEDUCTION OR EXPENSE OF EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY. IN OTHER WORDS BY A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND YOU CAN WRITE THEM OFF IN ONE YEAR YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ACCOUNTING OR THE OTHER PAPER WORK OR STUFF THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT. JUST EXPENSIVE FOR ONE-YEAR THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO PURCHASE, ENCOURAGES THEM TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND I WANT TO TALK SECOND ABOUT OUR TAX CODE FOR A SECOND. IS THEIR ANYBODY HERE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE TAX CODE? MY FRIEND IS IT IS THE MOST COMPLICATED AND DISGRACEFUL AND OUTRAGEOUS CODE IN THE WORLD AND IS ABOUT THAT. MY FRIENDS, HERE IS MY IDEA. WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMMISSION. MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER FOR YEARS WE COULDN'T CLOSE A MILITARY BASE IN THIS COUNTRY SO WE SET UP A DEAL WHERE THE APPOINTED COMMISSION, THE COMMISSION REPORTS TWO MONTHS LATER CONGRESS PASSED A VOTE UP OR DOWN. OKAY? WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO. I WANT SAID THE COMMISSION HEADED BY ALAN GREENSPAN WHETHER HE'S ALIVE OR DEAD IT DOESN'T MATTER. [LAUGHTER] IN OTHER WORDS, IF HE'S DEAD, WE WILL PUT SOME DARK GLASSES ON HAND AND PROP HIM UP LIKE A WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. OKAY? WE WILL HAVE ALAN GREENSPAN REPORT AND THEN WE WILL GIVE CONGRESS 60 DAYS TO VOTE UP OR DOWN. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO SIMPLIFY OR GIVE YOU A FAIR TAX CODE LET THEM VOTE NOT TO READ MY FRIENDS, YOU DESERVE A TAX CODE, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IF I PROMISE YOU YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS WHAT KEPT AMERICA AHEAD IN THE WORLD AND WE NEED TO HAVE A PERMANENT TAX CREDIT EQUAL 10% OF THE WAGES THAT ARE SPENT ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL SIMPLIFY THE TAX CODE, REWARD ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MAKE US MORE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. AND IT WILL OBVIOUSLY INCREASE INNOVATION. NOW, MY FRIENDS, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE DEMOCRATS PLANTS PUMP 70 DAY IT DOESN'T COME OFF THE PRINTING PRESS. IT COMES OUT OF YOUR POCKET. SO, I WANT TO TELL YOU AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES I WILL CUT YOUR TAXES I WILL ENCOURAGE THE GROWTH, I WILL ELIMINATE THE WASTEFUL AND UNNECESSARY SPENDING AND WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS FRIENDS, WE WILL GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA LIES AHEAD OF US. [APPLAUSE] IT LIES AHEAD I WILL RELY ON TOM COBURN AND JACK KEMP AND PHIL GRAMM WAS ALSO A PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN AND MARTY FELDSTEIN WHO WAS AHEAD OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS UNDER RONALD REAGAN. I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS, MY FRIENDS AND I'M NOT WITH PEOPLE THAT KNOW MOST OF THE ANSWER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST CONGRESS IN THIS WORLD AND THE MESSAGE IS PRO GROWTH, LESS TAXES, LESS SPENDING. THAT'S THE MESSAGE IF WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. AND I WANT TO SAY TO YOU AGAIN, AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD AND I WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING FIVE HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF SERVING THIS COUNTRY MOST OF MY LIFE AS YOU KNOW AND I'VE STARTED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. AMERICA'S STRENGTH IS OUR HOPE. OUR FAMILIES ARE OR GREATNESS. I BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY AND I HAVE A RECORD FOR 20 YEARS OF BEING INVOLVED IN ALMOST EVERY NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE WE FACE. AS LINDSAY MENTIONED I OPPOSE THE RUMSFELD STRATEGY, I SUPPORTED THE PETRAEUS STRATEGY. BUT FRIENDS, BY THE WAY IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, TIME MAGAZINE'S MAN OF THE YEAR WAS VLADIMIR PUTIN. I LOOKED INTO HIS OFFICE AND SAW THREE LETTERS, KGB. BUT THE MAN OF THE YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE WORLD WAS GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS, MY FRIENDS. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I WANT TO SAY, WANT TO TELL YOU WE ARE SUCCEEDING WE ARE SUCCEEDING IN IRAQ. MY DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS WHO DECLARED THE WAR LOST AND FRIENDS THAT SAID THEY COULDN'T AFFORD POLITICALLY, I'M NOT ASKING FOR AN APOLOGY FROM THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY WERE WRONG. OF ASKING THE DEMOCRATS TO REALIZE THAT IT'S TIME WE PUT PARTISANSHIP AT THE WATER'S EDGE. WE CAN SUCCEED IN IRAQ IN THE WORLD. RACHEL HAND ACROSS TO ME AND WE WILL WORK TOGETHER AND THE FT AL QAEDA. WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER AND WE CAN LET'S STOP. WE ARE SUCCEEDING IN IRAQ. WE KNOW THAT. I WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING, MY DEAR FRIENDS, I'M PROUD TO HAVE SERVED AS I SAID BUT I'M MOST PROUD OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING TODAY. M.A.D.D. IS DIVIDED ABOUT THIS WAR. NO AMERICAN IS DIVIDED ON OF SUPPORT FOR THE BRAVE YOUNG AMERICANS WHO ARE SERVING THIS NATION IN UNIFORM TODAY. AND THAT INCLUDES -- [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] -- THAT INCLUDES, HE WILL TELL YOU OUR GENERAL THE SOUTH CAROLINA GUARDED RESERVE HAS BEEN BACK AND BACK AND BACK AND BACK. NEVER BEFORE. AS A GUARD AND RESERVE SERVED WITH COURAGE AND TENACITY AND STRENGTH OF SOUTH CAROLINA GUARD HOUSE. I PROMISE YOU WE WILL EXPAND THE SIZE OF THE MARINE CORPS AND EXPAND THE SIZE OF THE ARMY SERVICE BURDEN CAN BE RELIEVED. BY THE WAY, WE'VE GOT NOW A CASE IN SURE YOU KNOW, 2000 SOUTH CAROLINA AND MEMBERS OF THE GUARD IN AFGHANISTAN AS WE SPEAK. THEY'VE BEEN OVER THERE AND THEY FOUGHT FOR THE PEOPLE'S FREEDOM AND THEY HAVE SACRIFICED. AND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE MORE PROUD AS A CITIZEN OF THIS STATE THAT FOR GENERATIONS, FOR GENERATIONS SOUTH CAROLINIAN IS HAVE SERVED THIS NATION OF PATRIOTISM AND DISTINCTION SO LET ME SAY I NEED YOUR VOTE. I'M PREPARED TO SERVE AND BY THANK YOU FOR THE WARMTH OF YOUR WELCOME, SOME OF CINDY'S AND MIGRATE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN TO BE HERE AND VISIT AND KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] >> SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE CHANGE. >> AND THANK YOU. JUST WAIT A SECOND, LINDSEY AND JACK ARE COMING. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM MUCH LONGER. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] >> LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE PLEASED THAT THE ENTHUSIASM AT THE TURNOUT. AND WE ARE PLEASED THE WAY THINGS ARE SHAPING THAT. AND I'M VERY GLAD TO HAVE A LOT OF THE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL BASE OF THE PARTY HERE IN THIS ELECTION. AND SO IN SOUTH CAROLINA. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> START OUT 17 DAY AND PORK-BARREL PROJECTS AND APPRECIATION SPENDING. $100 BILLION IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING THAT IS ACCESS SPENDING JUST FOR OPENERS. THEY ELIMINATE THE $21 BILLION IN THIS PORK-BARREL PUBLIC-WORKS PROJECTS WHICH HAS NO SET OUR PRIORITIES ARE IN A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. MY FRIEND, TOM COBURN CAN IDENTIFY A LOT MORE OF THOSE SPENDING IS OUT OF CONTROL. WE ALL KNOW THAT. 9,200 EARMARKED PORK-BARREL PROJECTS THAT NINE OUT OF $17 BILLION JUST ON THE LAST OMNIBUS SPENDING >> [INAUDIBLE] >> I BELIEVED I CAME IN 1993 THAT LOWER TAX RATES AND SPENDING RESTRAINTS, NOT SURE. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN SPENDING RACETRACKS AND BELIEVE IN 2001 AND I SAW A PART OF THE BACK END FOR TAX CUTS. AND SPENDING WENT COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL. WE MAST THIS HUGE DEFICIT AND LOST ELECTIONS. AND SO IF WE HAD DONE WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN 2001 WHICH WAS CUT SPENDING AS WELL AS TAX CUTS I THINK THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER OFF. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> WELL WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPORTING US BUT WE ARE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY AWARE EFFORT IS YOUR IN SOUTH CAROLINA. >> HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR YOU TO GET SOUTH CAROLINA GIVEN THE FACT THE FIRST SOUTHERN AND HOW IMPORTANT THE SOUTH HAS BEEN SHOWING ELECTABILITY? >> I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT AND I WILL WIN. >> IN TERMS OF THE SOUTH? >> I THINK SHOWING STRENGTH IN THE SOUTH IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK EVEN SOUTH CAROLINA OBVIOUSLY, FLORIDA WOULD PROBABLY BE IMPORTANT AS WELL BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THE SOUTH HAS BEEN IN THE LAST RECENT ELECTION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE WAYS OUR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE SUCCEEDED. >> YOU SOUNDED VERY SKEPTICAL -- SUITE TWO >> YES, IT HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT HOUSE THE STOCK MARKET HAS GONE DOWN AND WE GET THESE NEWS PARTICULARLY SINCE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH MORE SERIOUS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT WAS BEFORE. >> WHY NOT CALL A MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT >> I DID. I DID. AND I DO. >> THE ALTERNATIVE THAT DOUBLE -- MINIMUM TAX IS HITTING THE MIDDLE CLASS. IT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AS JOHN POINTS OUT THE AMT WAS MEANT TO TAKE THE TOP RICHEST PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE THEY PAY TAXES. IT'S THINK THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT'S WHY JOHN TALKED AS CALLED FOR MOVING IT. >> IT SEEMS LIKE THE UNITED STATES -- [INAUDIBLE] >> I THINK WE SHOULD USE EVERY METHOD AND WAY OF ACQUIRING ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES THAT WILL REDUCE OUR INDEPENDENCE AND ELIMINATE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL. I HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED SUBSIDIES FOR ETHANOL AND A POST PARIBAS ON IMPORTED AT ALL AND THAT HAS BEEN MY POSITION FOR A LONG TIME IN MY SUPPORT ETHANOL. BUT I ALSO SUPPORT NUCLEAR WIND, SOLAR, ALL OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. WE'RE SENDING $40 BILLION TO OIL-PRODUCING COMPANIES, SOME OF THAT MONEY ENDS UP IN HAND OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. >> DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU WORK WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS? >> YES, DID TO THINK I WOULD THINK IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT? [LAUGHTER] OUR HEMISPHERE, THE GROWING ECONOMY OF THE HEMISPHERE OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW IS BRAZIL. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND SOME OF MY FONDEST MEMORIES FROM MY EARLY IF YOU TOOK PLACE IN RIO DE JANEIRO AND AN EPISODE IN MY LIFE I WILL NOT RECOUNT HERE. >> YOU HAVE AN OLD GIRLFRIEND THERE. STOP. WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. >> IS EMIGRATION AN ISSUE? >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE. I DO. I THINK WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE CONTINUOUSLY. IT COMES UP AT EVERY MEETING WE WILL SECURE THE BORDERS FIRST AND HAVE A TAMPER PROOF BIOMETRIC FOR WORKERS AND WE WILL ADDRESS THE OTHERS. BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO FAITH TO TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND DIDN'T BELIEVE WE WOULD SECURE THE BORDERS SO HAVE TO SECURE THE BORDERS AND THEN MOVE ON. I STILL THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT IN A HUMANE AND COMPASSIONATE WAY. I REALLY DO. AND SO I BELIEVE AMERICA'S GREATNESS IS OUR ABILITY TO DO SUCH THINGS BUT THEY WANT THE BORDERS SECURED FIRST. >> YOU IGNORE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE STUFF GWEN ON AND MOST OF BACK IN 2000. SOME WERE SUGGESTING THAT IN EFFECT YOU ARE WINDING AND TRYING TO BLAME THE VICTIM STATUS. >> WELL IN ALL DUE RESPECT I HAVE NOT BEEN, I DON'T THINK I HAVE A REPUTATION FOR WINDING ABOUT MUCH. BUT I THINK MOST SOUTH CAROLINIAN IS THINK THERE IS NO PLACE SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICS FOR THIS KIND OF THING AND I AM CONFIDENT THEY WILL REJECT IT. WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIKE HENRY AND BOBBY HERALD AND THE LEADING CITIZENS OF THIS STATE WHO HAVE EXPOS AND CONDEMN THIS KIND OF CAMPAIGN. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. >> WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS TIME FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN 2000. WOULD YOU SAY THE SAME THING IS FAR LESS THAN WHAT HAPPENED IN 2000 AGAINST YOU? >> I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I WASN'T AWARE OF A LOT OF IT UP THE TIME. I MET A GUY THIS MORNING IT WAS AROUND 11:00 OR NOON. I FORGOT WHEN BUT THIS MORNING HE SAID HE RECEIVED ALREADY 11 PHONE CALLS TO IN A SAY IN THINGS ABOUT ME WHICH WERE LESS THAN FLATTERING. SO I THINK IT'S PRETTY HEAVY STUFF. >> CAN I SAY SOMETHING? WE HAVE HAD EIGHT YEARS TO GET TO KNOW JOHN THREE D WERE INTRODUCED IN 2000 WENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE YOU GET A LOT OF STUFF IN THE MAIL. PRESIDENT BUSH WAS A GREAT CANDIDATE, THAT NEVER GETS TALKED ABOUT. HE WAS A SOUTHERN GOVERNOR. THAT MATTER. BUT EIGHT YEARS LATER WE KNOW JOHN McCAIN, HE DID SERVE ON OUR WAY. AN AMERICAN HERO. WE KNOW PRESIDENT BUSH WON IN 2000 THAT WAS BY SIDE 2000 FOR THE LAST CAMPAIGN STOP WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH'S REAL ELECTION PEOPLE GIVE CREDIT FOR THAT A LOT OF THE BUSH PEOPLE WITH US AND WE KNOW JOHN McCAIN WHO STOOD UP AND SAID WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE. THAT'S WHY WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL AND WHY IT WON'T WORK. IT DIDN'T WORK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT WE'VE HAD EIGHT YEARS TO GET TO KNOW THIS GUY AND LOOK WHO'S HERE, JACK KEMP, TOM COBURN. WE'RE GOING TO WIN FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. >> I WILL CLARIFY AND THIS ISN'T MY FAVORITE SUBJECTS BUT I LOST IN THE YEAR 2000 NOT BECAUSE OF ANY NASTY CAMPAIGNING. I'VE LOST IN 2000 BECAUSE THAT GOVERNOR BUSH HAD THE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL BASE OF THIS STATE AND THEY WERE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE BLOW OF THE HAMPSHIRE, GALVANIZE OF THEIR SUPPORTERS, GET THEIR BOWED OUT THE WAY ELECTIONS ARE GENERALLY RUN. THIS TIME WE HAVE WHAT WE FEEL IS A STRONG FINANCIAL BASE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WIN THIS ELECTION. >> WE DON'T LIKE WIENER'S AND WE DO LIKE JOHN. >> ANY MORE? >> YOU SOUNDED SKEPTICAL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE STIMULUS. >> SKEPTICAL AS A SHORT-TERM STIMULUS. I'M SKEPTICAL ANY TIME TO TAKE TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD PURPOSE AND AN OBJECT BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PAY ABACK. I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE SOME DEMOCRATS WHO SAVED $70 BILLION. WHERE DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM? CAN BE CUT SPENDING TO GET THE $70 BILLION? CAN WE SHALL SOMETHING? WHAT IS IT? THAT MONEY DOESN'T COME OFF OF PRINTING PRESSES. SO THAT'S WHY I'M SKEPTICAL BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING TO COME FROM. >> WE ARE OUT OF TIME. >> THANKS VERY MUCH YOU GUYS. SEE YOU AT THE NEXT STOP. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] (music)(music) [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] (music)(music) >> THAT A BABY DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY TAX INCREASE. LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS PRICELESS. >> JOHN, JOHN. SOMEBODY GET A CAMERA. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] JOHN, HERE WE GO. THANK, GOT. GOD BLESS. HERE IT IS. >> THANK YOU SO MARCH. >> GOOD LUCK, JOHN. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] (music)(music) >> WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR EDUCATION, MR. MCKAY AND? WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR EDUCATION?

http://www.c-span.org/video/?203647-1/huckabee-michigan-primary-election,Huckabee Michigan Primary Election,Mike Huckabee,"MICHIGAN PRIMARY RESULTS. HE SPOKE TO SUPPORTERS IN LEXINGTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. (music) >> THANK YOU, MIKE, THANK YOU, DAVID. THANK YOU, SOUTH CAROLINA UP FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU. THANKS SO VERY MUCH. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WAITING OUT HERE. WE HAVE BETWEEN 801,000 PEOPLE PACKED IN THIS PLACE. PLEASE DO NOT CALL THE FIRE MARSHAL. I WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL WORD OF THANKS TO THE PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN. THEY HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. WERE OUTSPENT -- WE WERE OUTSPENT 50 TO ONE END TO DO AS WELL AS WE DID AS A REMARKABLE TESTAMENT TO VOLUNTEERS. I CONGRATULATE MITT ROMNEY. HE WON A GREAT WASTE -- RACE AND WORK HARD. HE HAS A GREAT BASE THEIR AND OUR HATS ARE OFF TO HIM FOR HIS VICTORY. IT LOOKS LIKE I WON IOWA. JOHN MCCAIN WON IN HAMPSHIRE. ROMNEY WON MICHIGAN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SOUTH CAROLINA. [APPLAUSE] WE PUT A FLAG IN THE GROUND HERE SATURDAY. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT REAL CLEAR THAT THE FIRST IN THE SOUTH PRIMARY IS GOING TO GIVE THEIR SUPPORT TO THE FIRST IN THE SOUTH CANDIDATE WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS NATION NEEDS LEADERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP THAT COMES RIGHT FROM THE EARTH AND RIGHT FROM THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE. MONTHS AGO WHEN NONE OF THE OTHER REPUBLICANS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, WHEN THE ALL SAID IT WAS DOING GREAT, I SAID YOU HAD BETTER KEEP YOUR EYE ON IT BECAUSE IF YOU SPEND TIME TALKING TO PEOPLE AND SPEND TIME LISTENING TO PEOPLE, YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS A WORLD OF HURT OUT THERE IN AMERICA. . >> WE NEED LOWER TAXES INSTEAD OF HIGHER TAXES. WE NEED A GOVERNMENT THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT MOTHERS AND FATHERS RAISED BETTER CHILDREN AND GOVERNMENTS DO. WE NEED TO GET GOVERNMENT OFF THE BACKS OF PARENTS AND LET THEM RAISE THEIR FAMILIES. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, PEOPLE HAVE ASKED WHO I AM AND WHERE I AM COMING FROM. I WILL TELL YOU WERE IN COMING FROM. I AM COMING FROM YOU. [APPLAUSE] A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THIS COUNTRY ARE REALIZING THAT IT IS TIME THAT THE PRESIDENCY AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT HEADQUARTERED AS MUCH IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AS MUCH AS IT IS IN THE SMALL TOWNS AROUND A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE DO THE WORK AND LIVE THEIR LIVES. THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT IS AS SMALL AS IT CAN BE. BUT THE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TO BE NEEDS TO DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. IT NEEDS TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS AND OUR SECURITIES. IT NEEDS TO KEEP US SAFE IN THIS NATION. THE SECOND THING IS THAT IT LEAVES A SALON SO WE CAN LIVE OUR LIVES AND LIVE IN THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES A CHANCE TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE. THAT IS WHAT AMERICA IS REALLY LOOKING FOR. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET WHEN WE GET ELECTED. [APPLAUSE] I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GETTING IN SOUTH CAROLINA. TODAY, THERE WERE HUGE CROWDS. THERE WERE ENTHUSIASTIC. WE TOLD PEOPLE THAT BETWEEN NOW AND SATURDAY, WE DO NOT WANTED TO SAY THEY WILL VOTE FOR US. WE WANT THEM TO SAY THEY WILL VOTE FOR US AND THEY WILL GET PEOPLE OUT THERE TO GO WITH THEM TO VOTE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, DO NOT LET ANYTHING TO DO FROM THAT. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, DO NOT EVEN SHOW UP. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, LET THE AIR OUT OF THEIR CARSTIRES ON SATURDAY. [LAUGHTER] YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ME SAY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU WILL VOTE FOR. IT DOES MATTER WHO YOU WILL VOTE FOR. IT IS OUR DETERMINATION THAT WE WILL NOT JUST DO WELL IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO THE CAMPBELL FAMILY. THEY'RE KIND OF THE GOLD STANDARD OF SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICS. EVERY YEAR SINCE A 1980 WHEN THEY PICKED RONALD REAGAN IN FOURTH PLACE, EVEN BACK THEN THE CAMPBELL FAMILY SAID THAT WAS TO THE RECORD TO SUPPORT. THEY PICKED A WINNER. EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE THAT TIME, THE CAMEL FAMILY HAS ADDED 1000. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WRONG YET. I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR. WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO LET THE CAMPBELL FAMILY DOWN IN 2008. THEY WILL STILL BE PICKING THE WINNER THIS WEEK. [APPLAUSE] DAVID BEASLEY HAS BEEN HERE WITH ME. WE HAVE BEEN GOVERNORS TOGETHER. WE ARE CLOSE FRIENDS. OUR WIVES ARE CLOSE FRIENDS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NO ONE MORE FIRED UP FOR US AND ALL OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND DAVID BEASLEY. OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, I AM SURE YOU WILL HEAR SOME THINGS ABOUT ME. THAT IS FINE. JUST REMEMBER, AS MY PASTOR USED TO TELL ME AS A LITTLE KID, WHEN YOU'RE GETTING KICKED IN THE BEHIND, IT PROVES THAT YOU ARE STILL OUT FRONT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] WE MAY TAKE A LITTLE KICKING OUT HERE. ALL THAT DOES IS PROVE THAT WE ARE STILL OUT FRONT. I WILL NEED TO HELP US THIS WEEK. LET ME TELL YOU WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO PROVE THAT ELECTING A PRESIDENT IS NOT JUST ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY A CANDIDATE HAS. IT IS ABOUT WHETHER HE CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND REFLECT THE VIEWS AND VALUES OF THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY ARE THE HEART AND SOUL OF AMERICA. MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS LOST ITS SOUL. I DO NOT THINK SO. I THINK IT IS TIME TO REGAIN THE VESSAT SOUL. WE WILL REDISCOVER THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE ARE A GREAT NATION NOT BECAUSE OF OUR GOVERNMENT. WE ARE A GREAT NATION BECAUSE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT EXPECT A LOT. THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE THE LEAD STORY ON THE EVENING NEWS. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT BEING ON THE EVENING NEWS OR THE FRONT PAGE. I HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT PAGE. I HAVE BEEN THE LEAD STORY BEFORE. IT IS ALL THAT ISNOT ALL THAT IS CRACKED UP TO BE. I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT THAT LEADS THIS COUNTRY NEVER FORGETTING WHO GOT ME THERE. IT IS PEOPLE LIKE THE TRUCK DRIVER THAT I MET IN MICHIGAN ON FRIDAY NIGHT. I MET HIM WHEN I WAS COMING OUT OF THE ARENA. WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE TRY TO GET IN THERE. THERE WERE ESTIMATES OF OVER 2000 PEOPLE CRAMMED INTO THE FACILITY. THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE WHO WERE OUTSIDE THAT COULD NOT GIVEN. -- THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE WHO WERE OUTSIDE THAT COULD NOT GET IN. I WALKED BY THIS BIG MAN. HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT. HE SAID HE NEEDED ME TO BE IN TRAVERSE CITY , MICHIGAN, THE NEXT DAY. I TOLD HIM I HAD TO BE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. HE SAID THAT THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN DINNER UP THERE. IT WAS THE REAGAN DINNER. HE SAID THE OTHER CANDIDATES WOULD BE THERE AND BE REPRESENTED. HE WANTED ME TO BE THERE. HE SAID HE WAS THE ONLY ONE HE KNEW GOING UP THERE. I TOLD HIM THAT I WANTED HIM TO SPEAK FOR ME. HE SAID THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE HE WAS JUST A TRUCK DRIVER. I TOLD AND HE WAS NOT JUST A TRUCK DRIVER. I WANTED FOR HIM TO TALK AND GIVE MY SPEECH. HE SAID I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I TOLD HIM I WAS AS QUALIFIED AS ANYBODY TO SAY WHY HE WAS SUPPORTING ME. HE ASKED IF I WAS SURE. I TOLD THEM I WANTED HIM TO THE MAKE THE SPEECH. HE TOLD ME HE WOULD DO IT. I GOT A LETTER FROM HIM. IT IS ON THE WEBSITE. YOU HAVE TO READ IT. RADICALLY NEXT BEFORE YOU READ IT. HE WENT UP -- BUT I TAKE A KLEENEX WITH YOU BEFORE YOU READ IT. HE SET UP A TABLE FOR MIKE HUCKABEE. A U.S. SENATOR HAD JUST SIGNED UP TO SPEAK FOR ONE OF THE CANDIDATES. A CONGRESSMAN HAD SIGNED UP FOR THE OTHERS. THEY ASKED THE U.S.. HE GAVE HIS NAME. ASKED WHAT OFFICE HE HELD. HE SAID HE DID NOT HOLD AN OFFICE. HE DID NOT HAVE AN OFFICE. HE WAS A TRUCK DRIVER. HE SAID HE DID NOT HAVE BASICA SUIT. HE SAID HE WOULD BE UNDERDRESSED. THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES GOT UP AND INTRODUCED HIM. HE SAID HE WAS FOR MIKE HUCKABEE AND HE WAS UNDER ARREST. -- AND HE WAS UNDRESSED. [LAUGHTER] PEOPLE SAID WAS THE SPEECH OF THE NIGHT. IT WAS FULL OF HEART ABOUT THIS COUNTRY AND WHY HE IS SUPPORTING ME. I BELIEVE THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE HIM. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE SUPPORTING ME NOT BECAUSE HE IS EXPECTED TO BE AN AMBASSADOR TO SOMEWHERE. HE IS SUPPORTING ME BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT WHEN I AM SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE, I WILL REMEMBER WHO HE IS. I WILL REMEMBER WHO SENT ME THERE. I HAVE NEWS FOR RANDY. WE WILL WIN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE WILL WIN IN FLORIDA. WE'RE GOING ON TO THE NOMINATION AND THE WHITE HOUSE. WE WILL GET READY A SUIT. HE WILL BE ON THE STAGE ON INAUGURATION DAY. THIS ELECTION WILL BE AS MUCH ABOUT RANDY AND THE PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA AS ANYBODY YOU HAVE MET BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT. THIS WILL BE A GREAT WEEK. WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MOBILIZE THE TROOPS. EVERY TIME YOU SEE IN RANDY BISHOP OUT THERE. TELL HIM WE NEED HIM. WE NEED TO SUPPORT. I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE, MIKE BEASLEY, MIKE CAMPBELL, THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING US EVERYWHERE. MANY OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS ARE WITH US. I WANT TO THANK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU WILL BE OUT THERE WORKING FOR US. YOU'LL BE MULTIPLYING OURSELVES MANY TIMES BETWEEN NOW AND SATURDAY. THANK YOU, FOLKS. GOD BLESS YOU. ON TO VICTORY ON SATURDAY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (music) (music) [ONLY IN AMERICA] (music) >>",2015-11-07 17:14:58,2008-01-15,Lexington,South Carolina
http://www.c-span.org/video/?203697-1/mccain-campaign-event,McCain Campaign Event,Lindsey Graham,"NOW, TO THE USS YORKTOWN IN MOUNT PLEASANT, SOUTH CAROLINA. C-SPAN IS CAMPAIGN 2008 COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH A JOHN MCCAIN RALLY AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. AND NUMBER OF INTRODUCTIONS NOW UNDER WAY. WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE SENATOR TO ARRIVE. THE SPEAKER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE SPEAKING TO THE AUDIENCE. LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. >> ONE OF THE REASONS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ELECT HIM PRESIDENT IS HE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE WANT TO CUT TAXES. WE WANT TO MAKE THE BUSH TAX CUT PERMANENT. WE ALL WANT TO DO THAT, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GET SPENDING UNDER CONTROL AS WELL. >> THAT IS GREAT. THE ONLY REASON I'M BEING RUDE AND INTERRUPT AND BOBBY IS BECAUSE THERE IS A MAN HERE THAT I WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM. WE ARE GOING TO LET BOBBY FINISH HIS THOUGHTS IN A SECOND. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF VETS FOR FREEDOM? IT WAS AN ORGANIZATION CREATED BY VETERANS OF IRAQ. THEY CAME TO CONGRESS TO BED THE CONGRESS NOT TO SURRENDER. -- BEGGED THE CONGRESS NOT TO SURRENDER. THEY CAME TO CONGRESS AND SAID WHETHER YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT OR VEGETARIAN, PLEASE DO NOT LEAD WHAT WE'RE DONE IN IRAQ BE FOR NOTHING. HANG IN THERE. THIS HARRY REID STATEMENT THAT THE WAR WAS LOST WAS NEWS TO PETE AND HIS COMRADES. THEY DID NOT THINK THEY HAVE LOST. THEY FORMED A GROUP TO COME TO CONGRESS AND LITERALLY BEGGED TO SEE THIS THING THROUGH. THEY WERE OUR ANCHOR, OUR COMFORT, AND THE HELP OF JOHN AND ME AND JOE LIEBERMAN, AND LIKE EVERY GOOD THING, DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY GOT STARTED? IN A BAR IN CHARLESTON. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE TELL THESE PEOPLE WHY YOU DID NOT WANT US TO SURRENDER IN IRAQ, AND TELL US ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] >> IT IS AN ABSOLUTE HONORED TO BE HERE. ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THESE DECORATED VETERANS. WHAT AN HONOR. WHAT SENATOR GRAMM SAID IS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE. WE CAME UP THERE AS A GROUP OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN VETERAN SAYING DO NOT LET THE SACRIFICE OF THE GUYS WE FOUGHT OVER THERE WAS BE IN VAIN. I WAS OVER THERE WITH THE 141ST AIRBORNE. [APPLAUSE] FROM 2005 TO 2006. I CAME BACK A LITTLE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I KNEW WE NEEDED TO WIN, AND I KNOW IRAQ IS THE CENTRAL BATTLEFRONT IN A LARGER FIGHT AGAINST RADICAL ISLAM, AND JOHN MCCAIN KNOWS THAT TOO, AND SO DOES SENATOR GRAMM AND A LOT OF OTHER SENATORS ON CAPITOL HILL, AND SOME DO NOT. THEY WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE LEFT THAT BATTLEFIELD BEFORE IT WAS FINISHED. SO WE JUST BROUGHT OUR GUYS UP TO CAPITOL HILL. WE HAD AS MANY MEETINGS AS WE COULD WITH ALL THE GUYS UP ON THE HILL, AND THANKFULLY, MOST WERE WILLING TO MEET WITH US. SOME SAID THEY DID NOT WANT TO HEAR IT. OTHERS SAID IT WOULD THIS AND WHAT HAVE OUR BACK. THE ONE THAT WAS WITH US THE MOST WAS SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] HE HAS SEEN IT BEFORE. HE UNDERSTANDS THE STAKES. I CAME BACK FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK WE HAD ENOUGH TROOPS, AND I DID NOT THINK WE WOULD NECESSARILY USING THE RIGHT STRATEGY, AND THERE WAS ONE MAN AT THE END OF 2006 WHO WAS SAYING THAT SAME THING, AND IT WAS JOHN MCCAIN. HE WAS A LONE VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS, SAYING THAT THIS IS A FIGHT WE NEED TO WIN, AND WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR STRATEGY, AND WE NEED MORE TROOPS TO DO IT. HE SAID SOMETHING THAT I DO NOT THINK HAS BEEN REPORTED ON ENOUGH. AS A SOLDIER, IT REALLY RESONATED WITH ME. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD RATHER WIN A WAR THAN WHEN THE CAMPAIGN. THAT IS A POWERFUL STATEMENT. -- THAN WIN A CAMPAIGN. I DO NOT THINK YOU'LL FIND MANY POLITICIANS OUT THERE THAT WILL SAY THAT AND REALLY MEAN IT. AS A VETERAN, IT MEANS A LOT TO ME, AND I KNOW IT MEANS A LOT TO THE OTHER VETERANS ON THE STAGE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO STICK HIS NECK OUT FOR AN UNPOPULAR WAR BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED IN WASHINGTON. THAT IS WHAT JOHN MCCAIN WILL BRING TO WASHINGTON. I CAN TESTIFY THAT HE STOOD WITH US ON CAPITOL HILL WHEN THINGS WERE TOUGH, AND THAT MEANT A LOT LESS. -- THAT MEANT A LOT TO US. I CANNOT THANK SENATOR GRAMM ENOUGH AS WELL. HE WAS WITH US EVERY SINGLE STEP STANDING WITH US ON THE SENATE AND HOUSE FLOOR. IT WAS AN HONOR TO STAND WITH HIM. SO THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR SAKE, I HOPE HE DOES NOT LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUY HERE THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING. I SEE SENATOR MCCAIN COMING THROUGH THE CROWD IN THE BACK. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOHN MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES. JOHN AND CINDY MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO THAT WONDERFUL MAYOR, PERELMAN. [APPLAUSE] >> JOIN ME ONE MORE TIME. SENATOR MCCAIN, IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE YOU IN OUR TOWN TONIGHT. >> I'M GOING TO SING, AND WE ARE GOING TO INTO THIS PLACE UP. [LAUGHTER] WE ARE GOING TO GET RIGHT TO THE POINT. THIS IS THE LAST RALLY ON THE LAST DAY BEFORE THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIMARY IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY SCHEDULE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ENDING WHERE WE BEGAN. I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS. I HAVE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT IT. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A CAMPAIGN AND BE CALLED A FRIEND OF ANYBODY IN MY LIFE AND JOHN MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] WE CHANGE CENTERS EVERY 50 YEARS IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHETHER WE NEED TO NOT. STROM WAS ELECTED IN 1954. I WAS BORN IN 1955, AND I WAS BORN IN THE SAME HOSPITAL OF JOHN EDWARDS. I WAS IN THE RIGHT WING OF THE HOSPITAL, AND HE WAS IN THE LEFT WING OF THAT HOSPITAL. [APPLAUSE] I APPARENTLY LEARNED SOMETHING HE DID NOT. THERE IS ONE AMERICA. SOME OF US ARE DOING BETTER, AND SOME OF US NEED TO BE DOING BETTER, BUT WE ARE ALL IN IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN THEY SHOOT AT YOU IN IRAQ, THEY DO NOT ASK ANYTHING ABOUT WHERE YOU COME FROM. THEY JUST SEE THAT FLAG, AND EVERYBODY IS WEARING THE FLAG -- RICH, POOR, BLACK, WHITE. PEOPLE WITH ACCENTS FROM NEW YORK. [LAUGHTER] BUT WE ARE IN IT TOGETHER, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT DUTY A CITIZEN HAS IN A DEMOCRACY IS TO VOTE. [APPLAUSE] IT MAY BE CALLED TOMORROW, AND IT MAY RAIN TOMORROW, BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT -- IT IS TOUGH IN IRAQ. IT IS TOUGH IN AFGHANISTAN. THESE PEOPLE OVER THERE WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR OUR FREEDOM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE DEPENDING UPON YOU TO ELECT THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. WHAT AN AWESOME RESPONSE ABILITY. TO PUT THE BURDEN ON THE AVERAGE CITIZEN TO PICK THE MILITARY LEADER OF THE COUNTRY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT -- IT HAS WORKED WELL, HASN'T IT? WHEN YOU GO IN THAT WAS TOMORROW, ONCE WILL BE FINE, BUT HIS HIS THEY WILL LET YOU GO BACK -- [LAUGHTER] PLEASE TERMS OF YOUR CHOICE, YOUR VOTE, WILL BE WHAT IS USED TO DECIDE TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS. YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE TROOPS? I KNOW YOU DO. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TELL ME. I KNOW YOU DO. I KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE. I WANT YOU TO ASK ONE QUESTION -- WHO IS BEST PREPARED TO LEAD THEM ON DAY ONE? >> JOHN MCCAIN. >> WHO HAS WALKED IN THEIR SHOES? >> JOHN MCCAIN. >> WHO SPEAKS THEIR LANGUAGE? >> JOHN MCCAIN. >> WHO WILL LEAD THEM TO VICTORY >> > JOHN MCCAIN. >> YOU ARE VERY SMART. [LAUGHTER] JOHN HAS SEVEN KIDS TOTAL. WHAT IS A GENIUS TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY. THE OTHER IS A 19-YEAR-OLD MARINE. [APPLAUSE] FINALLY, SOMEBODY IN THE FAMILY MADE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES BECAUSE HE IS A LANCE CORPORAL. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHEN HE IS OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, HE CAN LOOK EVERYBODY IN THE EYE, EVERY FAMILY AND SAY, ""I'M NOT GOING TO ASK ANYTHING OF YOU THAT I'M NOT ASKING OF MY OWN FAMILY."" HE WILL HAVE MORE AUTHORITY AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF AS ANYBODY IN THIS FIELD. GIONO'S THE WORLD, AND MOST IMPORTANT, THE WORLD KNOWS JOHN. IN A DEMOCRACY, YOU CAN MAKE NASTY PHONE CALLS. YOU CAN SEND AWFUL E-MAILS. YOU CAN PUT TRASH OUT EVERYWHERE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK THIS TIME. [APPLAUSE] LAST EIGHT YEARS, WE GOT TO KNOW JOHN. WE KNOW HE STOOD BY PRESIDENT BUSH, AND WE KNOW HE RISKED LOSING HIS CAREER TO CHANGE STRATEGY IN IRAQ BECAUSE HE LOVES THE COUNTRY MORE THAN HE LOVES HIS POLITICAL CAREER. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO WIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS, BECAUSE WE LOVE TELLING THE TRUTH EVEN WHEN IT HURTS. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING COMES EASY. JOHN HAS LIVED A LIFE WHERE NOTHING HAS COME EASY. HIS FATE IS IN YOUR HANDS, THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. JOHN, YOU ARE IN GOOD HANDS, MY FRIEND. [APPLAUSE] I AM NOT THE ONLY GRAMM ON STAGE, THANK GOD. BILL IS THE SMART ONE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM? JUDGE IN MAN BY THE COMPANY HE KEEPS AND THE FRIENDS HE HAS. BILL HAS BEEN A LEGEND IN TERMS OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE AND STANDING UP TO MAKE WASHINGTON WORK BETTER FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. HE IS HERE TO SUPPORT HIS FRIEND JOHN MCCAIN. A WARM SOUTH CAROLINA WELCOME. [APPLAUSE] >> I WILL BE BRIEF. I DID NOT WANT PEOPLE TO COME AND SAY THEY NEVER GOT TO HEAR MCCAIN BECAUSE OF THOSE GRAND BROTHERS -- GRAHAM BROTHERS. [LAUGHTER] I LOVE JOHN MCCAIN, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I'M FOR HIM FOR PRESIDENT. FOR WASHINGTON TO BEGIN TO REAGAN, IF THERE IS ANYTHING I KNOW ABOUT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY, IT IS THAT CHARACTER COUNTS. AND JOHN MCCAIN HAS CHARACTER. [APPLAUSE] KOPPEL BECAUSE OF THE LIFE HE HAS LIVED, BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP HE HAS PROVIDED, HE HAS THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IN A DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT TIME. NO ONE ELSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS THAT MORAL AUTHORITY. HE IS THE CANDIDATE WHO WILL STOP THE SPENDING SPREE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. [APPLAUSE] HE IS THE CANDIDATE THAT HAS THE COURAGE AND THE COMMITMENT TO VETO THE SPENDING BILLS SO WE WILL HAVE HOUSING PROGRAMS AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS, BUT A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS, YOU WILL GET TO CARRY OUT THROUGH YOUR FAMILY WITH YOUR OWN MONEY. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME FINALLY SAID IN HIS CAMPAIGN, EVERYBODY RUNNING IS FOR CHANGE, BUT YET NONE OF THESE CANDIDATES EVER TELL US WHAT CHANGES THEY HAVE WROUGHT. JOHN MCCAIN CHANGED THE WAR IN IRAQ, AND WE WOULD BE LOSING THAT WAR TODAY IF IT WERE NOT FOR HIS COURAGE. [APPLAUSE] NOW, I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE CINDY MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU ONE LITTLE STORY ABOUT HER. SHE IS IN BANGLADESH, AND SHE IS IN A HOSPITAL, AND SHE SEES THIS LITTLE INCIDENT THAT HAS A CLEFT PALATE. THIS INFANT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT TO DIE. MOST OF US WOULD HAVE FELT BAD ABOUT. WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE HAD A WELL THAT TIER. WE MIGHT HAVE WANTED SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, BUT WE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE A THING ABOUT IT. CINDY MCCAIN SAID, ""I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE WORLD, BUT I CAN CHANGE HER WORLD."" AND SHE DID. CINDY MCCAIN. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. I AM VERY GLAD TO BE HERE TONIGHT. THIS HAS BEEN A LONG EIGHT YEARS, COMING BACK, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TONIGHT. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE HEARD EVERYBODY ELSE UP HERE SAY THEY LOVE JOHN MCCAIN. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I LOVE JOHN MCCAIN, TOO. [LAUGHTER] MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TONIGHT IS THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WARM HOSPITALITY, YOUR FRIENDSHIP, YOUR DEVOTION, AND YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF MY HUSBAND. IT DOES MY HEART PROUD BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN HIM.

I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOU AND KATHY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP, AND WHAT BOBBY AND THE LEGISLATURE AND GOV. HAVE PROVEN IS THAT GOVERNMENTS MATTER. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS REMARKABLE. THE STATE TOOK A HARD BLOW WHEN THE TEXTILE MILLS CLOSED DOWN. AND I HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. BUT TODAY, THERE ARE BUSINESSES WHO ARE GOING TO COME TO SOUTH CAROLINA, AND BECAUSE OF THEIR WORK, THERE IS EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE WORKERS THAT THE NEED TO PROSPER HERE IN THIS STATE. THANK YOU AGAIN, BOBBIE, FOR EVERYTHING TO YOU AND KATHY HAVE DONE FOR ME. I'M VERY GRATEFUL. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, THE BRAINS OF THE OUTFIT IS HIS WIFE, CATHY. OUR BELOVED ATTORNEY GENERAL, I WANT TO TELL YOU HE IS A GREAT GUY. I KNOW THAT YOU THINK THE WORLD OF HIM. YOU ALSO MAY KNOW THAT HE IS A LAWYER. THAT HAPPENS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LAWYER AND A CATFISH? ONE IS A SCUM SUCKING BOTTOM DOLLAR AND THE OTHER IS A FISH. HENRY DOES NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT HENRY MCMASTER ON YOUR BEHALF IS SUING THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA FOR STEALING SOUTH CAROLINA'S WATER. THANK YOU, HENRY, FOR DOING THAT. GET THAT WATER BACK. CINDY AND I LIVE IN A STATE. CALIFORNIA HAS STOLEN ALL OF OUR WATER. WE HAVE SO LITTLE WATER IN ARIZONA THAT THE TREE STAYS THE DOGS. IT IS AWFUL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN HERE, ARE WE? THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. I WANT TO SAY ONE MORE WORD ABOUT HENRY MCMASTER, IF I COULD, IN A MOMENT OF SERIOUSNESS. I'M AWARE BECAUSE OF MY WORK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND YOU ARE, TOO, OF THE TERRIBLE SCOURGED AND THE EVIL THAT IS AFFLICTING OUR INTERNET, A MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS, IT IS TRYING TO DESTROY FAMILIES ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND THE WORLD. THE LEADER IN THE FIGHT IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND NATIONALLY AGAINST INTERNET CHILD PORNOGRAPHY IS HENRY MCMASTER. THANK YOU FOR SAVING THE AMERICAN FAMILY. I'M VERY GRATEFUL. [APPLAUSE] MY FRIENDS, HENRY MCMASTER AND HIS TEAM JUST THE REST OF THE 109TH PERSON THAT ENGAGES IN THIS EVIL ACTIVITY. AND HE WILL NOT GIVE UP THE FIGHT, AND WE WILL NOT GIVE UP THE FIGHT, AND HENRY WILL TELL YOU, KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILDREN ARE ON THE INTERNET, MY FRIENDS. KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY, LINDSAY GRAMM -- THE REASON WHY I LOSS IN 2000 -- THAT IS THE REASON RIGHT THERE. AND THOSE OF YOU THAT KNOW HIM CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY. I APPRECIATE HIM VERY MUCH, AND I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH, AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT WHEN YOU TURN ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS THAT YOU SEE MY FRIEND. WHEN YOU SEE A PERSON WHO LEADS IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND I FOLLOW, AND HE LEADS, AND I'M PROUD TO BE HIS FOLLOWERS AND PARTNER. WHEN WE APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE UNITED STATES OF THE SUPREME COURT THAT INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE STRICTEST FASHION AND DO NOT LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH AND WE GET ALITO AND ROBETS,RTS, IT IS BECAUSE OF LINDSEY GRAMM AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO ASSURE YOU AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT ARE WILL TRY TO FIND A CLONE OF JUSTICE ROBERTS. I WILL LOOK ALL OVER THIS PLANET TO TRY TO FIND ONE. LET ME JUST SAY ONE OTHER WORD VERY QUICKLY -- I'M PROUD OF HIS WORK IN THE SENATE. I'M MOST PROUD OF AFFECTED USERS IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE RESERVE HAS A JAG LAWYER, AND LAST AUGUST, WHEN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES VOTES ITSELF A PAY RAISE AND GOES ON VACATION, LINDSAY GRAMM PUTS ON THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE OFFICER, GOES TO BAGHDAD IN 125-DEGREE HEAT, AND TRIES TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE GAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL OF DEMOCRACY, AND THAT IS THE RULE OF LAW. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MY FRIEND AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS. WE SERVE TOGETHER IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE. I RESPECT NO ONE MORE IN AMERICA ON THE ISSUE OF ECONOMICS AND OTHERS THAN I DO SO. BACK IN THE 1980'S, WE WERE FOOT SOLDIERS IN THE REAGAN REVOLUTION, AND WE CUT TAXES, BUT WE CUT SPENDING. WE CUT SPENDING BACK THEN, AND WE SAVE THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY, AND WE UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT LEARN THAT LESSON. ALL THE LEGISLATION TO CUT SPENDING AS WELL AS TAXES, MY FRIENDS. I RELY ON PHIL FOR MANY THINGS, BUT AS A CONGRESSMAN, HE IS WITHOUT PEER. I THANK HIM FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP AND HIS SUPPORT. I THANK YOU, AND I THANK YOU ALL. [APPLAUSE] AND I WILL NOT TALK TOO LONG, BUT I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. BY THE WAY, BECAUSE OF LINDSAY, I LOST IN 2000, I SLEPT LIKE A BABY. SLEEP TWO HOURS, WAKE UP AND CRY, SLEEP TWO HOURS, WITH UP AND CRY. I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR YOUR WARMTH, YOUR HOSPITALITY, YOUR GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT. THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING ME ALL OVER THIS WONDERFUL STATE, BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU MOST OF ALL FOR YOUR PATRIOTISM AND LOVE AND SERVICE TO THIS NATION. NO STATE IN AMERICA HAS SERVED MORE HONORABLY AND MORE PATRIOTICALLY AND WITH MORE SACRIFICE THROUGHOUT MANY GENERATIONS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, I THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR AMERICA AND OUR STATE. I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO KNOW YOU. I HAVE BEEN HARD TO TRAVEL THE STATE ALL UP AND DOWN, AND THERE'S NO PLACE I WOULD RATHER END UP AND RIGHT HERE ON THE USS YORKTOWN. THIS SHIP, THEY SHIP IT EPITOMIZES THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE IN MANY WARS OF SO MANY AMERICANS, AND I'M VERY PROUD AND PLEASED TO BE HERE. MY FRIENDS, I JUST WANT TO MENTION TO YOU IN A COUPLE OF ITEMS VERY QUICKLY. ONE OF THEM IS OUR VETERANS. THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE RIGHT HERE THAT I SHOULD NOT MENTION OUR VETERANS BECAUSE WE HONOR THEM, AND WE APPRECIATE THEM, AND THE SHIP RIGHT HERE IS A LIVING TESTIMONIAL TO THOSE WHO SACRIFICED IN THE GREATEST GENERATION AND OTHER CONFLICTS, BUT I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN AMERICA, AND I WANT TO TALK TO OUR VETERANS ABOUT IT VERY BRIEFLY. YOU AND I KNOW THAT VETERANS' HEALTH CARE IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE, NOR IS IT WHAT OUR VETERANS DESERVE. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I WILL FIX VETERANS HEALTH-CARE TO HONOR AND APPRECIATE THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [APPLAUSE] I CARRY AROUND WITH ME JUST ABOUT AT ALL TIMES A QUOTATION FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON IN 1789. HE SAID, ""THE WILLINGNESS WITH WHICH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO SERVE IN ANY WAR NO MATTER HOW JUSTIFIED SHALL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL AS TO HOW THEY PERCEIVE THE VETERANS OF EARLIER WARS WERE TREATED AND APPRECIATED BY THEIR COUNTRY."" MY FRIENDS, GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS RIGHT IN 1789, AND HE IS RIGHT TODAY. NOT ONLY DO WE OWE THIS DEBT TO OUR VETERANS, BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO GET THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST AND FINEST AMERICANS, TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY IN THE FUTURE, THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK TO HOW WE TREAT THOSE WHO SERVED PREVIOUSLY. VERY BRIEFLY, THIS IS A TOUGH WAR. THIS IS A HARD WORK. YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH IT HAS BEEN. YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE P HAVE PTSD, THE INJURIES AND WILL MISS -- HAVE CHALLENGES OF PTSD, THE INJURIES FROM IED'S AND WE WILL HAVE TO EXPAND THE VA TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE PEOPLE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN. MY FRIENDS, I'M SICK AND TIRED, AND OUR VETERANS ARE SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING TO DRIVE FOR AN HOUR TO TO GOOD TO BE A FACILITY TO STAND IN LINE TO STAND IN LINE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. MY FRIENDS, I WILL GIVE EVERYONE OF OUR VETERANS AND PLASTIC CARD AND SAY IF YOU HAVE A ROUTINE HEALTH CARE NEED, TAKE THAT PLASTIC CARD AND GO TO THE DOCTOR, WOULD THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER OF YOUR CHOICE. [APPLAUSE] YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO STAND IN LINE TO STAND IN LINE. [APPLAUSE] WITH THAT, I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE SIGNS THAT SAY IRISH FOR MCCAIN, SO THEREFORE, -- THERE YOU GO. THERE THEY GO. OK. OH, MARINES FROM A CANE. BLESS YOU. SOLDIERS FROM A CANE. I WILL NOT TELL ANY MARINE JOKES. -- MARINES FOR MCCAIN. SOLDIERS FOR MCCAIN. AND IN THE BAR IN BOSTON, MASS., ONE GUY AT EITHER END. FINALLY, ONE GUY GETS UP, GOES AND SITS DOWN TO THE OTHER END AND AS THE OTHER DAY WHERE HE'S FROM. HE SAYS I'M FROM IRELAND. THE OTHER GUY SAYS HE'S FROM IRELAND TO. THE OFFER TO BUY IT TO THE DRINKS COME BACK AND FORTH. THEY FIND THAT THERE FROM DUBLIN. LET ME BUY YOU A DRINK. ONE S WHERE HE IS A HIGH-SCHOOL PEERESSES HE WENT TO ST. MARY'S. BACK AND FORTH BY INTELLIGENCE. A GUY WALKS INTO THE BAR, SEES ALL THE COMMOTION THAT THE END OF BARNESES TO THE BARTENDER, ""WAS GOING ON?"" BARTENDER SAYS, ""IT IS JUST THEIR RALLY TWINS GET DRUNK AGAIN -- THE O'REILLY TWINS GETTING DRUNK AGAIN."" [LAUGHTER] I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SPENDING. AS YOU KNOW, OUR ECONOMY IS GOING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES. WE ALL KNOW THAT, BUT NOTHING IS INEVITABLE IN THIS LIGHT. NOTHING IS WITH OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE IT. WHY ARE WE HAVING DIFFICULTIES WE ARE? THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE THINGS WE HAVE GOT TO FIX IS THAT WE HAVE LET SPENDING GET COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL, AND WE HAVE GONE ON A SPENDING SPREE, WHICH HAS MORTGAGED YOUR CHILDREN'S FUTURES, AND IT HAS GOT TO STOP. WE START WITH A POOR BILL EARMARKS SPENDING, WHICH HAS BECOME AN EPIDEMIC, AND IT HAS BRED CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND I DO NOT SAY THAT LIGHTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS PRESIDE -- RESIDING IN FEDERAL PRISON. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP IT. WE REPUBLICANS CAME TO POWER IN 1994 TO CHANGE GOVERNMENT, AND GOVERNMENT CHANGED US. THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW A COUPLE WEEKS AGO A SPENDING BILL WITH 9200 PORK-BARREL PROJECTS ON WORTH $17 BILLION OF YOUR MONEY. MY FRIENDS, THAT IS DISGRACEFUL. IT MAKES YOU LAUGH, AND IT MAKES YOU CRY. WE SPENT $3 MILLION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO STUDY THE DNA OF BEARS IN MONTANA. I DO NOT KNOW OF THAT WAS A PATERNITY ISSUE OR A CRIMINAL ISSUE. [LAUGHTER] RONALD REAGAN USED TO SAY, CONGRESS SPENDS MONEY LIKE DRUNKEN SAILOR, ONLY HE NEVER KNEW A SIMILAR DRUG OR SOBER WITH THE IMAGINATION OF CONGRESS, AND THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD LINE, AND A GREAT PLACE TO USE THAT LINE. I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP WHEN I TELL YOU I GOT AN E-MAIL FROM A GUY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO THAT SAID, ""AS A FORMER IS A DRUNKEN SAILOR, I RESENT BEING COMPARED TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS."" [APPLAUSE] MAYBE THE GUY WHO'S IN THAT E- MAIL IS WITH US TONIGHT. ANYWAY, MY FRIENDS, LET ME TELL YOU THIS -- IN 24 YEARS, AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, I NEVER ASKED FOR NOR RECEIVED A SINGLE YOUR MARGINAL PORK BARREL PROJECT FROM MY STATE. I NEVER WILL, AND MY STATE IS DOING FINE, AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THESE OTHER GUYS PAID, AND I'LL HAVE THEM IMITATE MY RECORD. [APPLAUSE] SO LET ME JUST SAY AGAIN, FAIR WARNING -- I WILL VETO EVERY SINGAPORE BROKE YOUR MARK PROJECT -- I WILL VETO EVERY SINGLE PORK BARREL EARMARKED BILL THAT COMES ACROSS MY DESK, AND I WILL GIVE NAMES, AND YOU'LL KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. LET ME FINALLY PUT YOU IN THE RIGHT TERMS THAT ARE BETTER UNDERSTAND WILL. IT RAISES INTEREST RATES. IT MAKES YOU PAY MORE IN PAYMENTS ON YOUR AUTOMOBILE. IT COSTS YOU MORE WHEN YOU GO TO THE STORE. MY FRIEND, AS I TOLD YOU, IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST RENOWNED ECONOMIST, SAID THAT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE PORK BARREL SPENDING IN THOSE TWO YEARS, SOME $35 BILLION, WOULD HAVE MEANT THAT EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A TAX CREDIT OF $1,000. WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER DO -- HAVE THE BRIDGE TO NOWHERE IN ALASKA OF $233 MILLION BRIDGE TO AN ISLAND OF 50 PEOPLE ON IT, OR A THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA? WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE? I KNOW WHICH YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE. [APPLAUSE] LET ME BRIEFLY SAY, WE NEED TO CUT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. RIGHT NOW, IT IS 35%, ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD, SECOND ONLY TO JAPAN. WE NEED TO APPEASE BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. CUT THE TAX RATES OF THE CORPORATIONS WILL THEN BE ABLE TO PASS ON THOSE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES, AND THEY WILL STAY IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MY SECOND POINT IS MAKE THE R&D TAX CREDIT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, AND WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE THIRD THING, AMONG OTHERS, THAT WE NEED TO DO IS KEEP YOU ON A BUSINESS AND HOW TO PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT, EXPENSE IT IN ONE YEAR. YOU GET THE GAINS FROM THAT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE REST OF IT. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO, AND BEFORE WE PRINT MORE MONEY, AT LEAST LET'S MAKE A COMMITMENT TO MAKE THE TAX BREAKS PERMANENT SO THAT FAMILIES IN AMERICA DO NOT EXPERIENCE A TAX INCREASE IN 2010. [APPLAUSE] I WILL BE GLAD TO SIT DOWN WITH DEMOCRATS AND LIBERTARIANS AND VEGETARIANS AND ANYBODY ELSE, BUT MY FRIENDS WE HAVE GOT TO STICK TO THE PRINCIPLE OF RETURNING TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNS EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA, AND THAT IS, YOU CANNOT SPEND MORE MONEY THAN YOU TAKE IN. THAT HAS GOT TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO AND I JUST MENTIONED TO YOU ABOUT THE BRAVE YOUNG MAN AND WOMEN SERVING IN AMERICA TODAY. YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT THIS WAR HAS BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING, THAT AMERICANS ARE SADDENED BY THE SACRIFICE. I ALSO WANT TO REMIND YOU AGAIN IT WAS LINDEGREN IN A FEW OTHERS THAT SAID THE RUMSFELD STRATEGY WAS FAILING. I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. WE HAD TO CHANGE THE STRATEGY, AND REPUBLICANS CRITICIZED ME FOR BEING DISLOYAL. MY FRIENDS, AT THAT TIME, IT WAS NOT POPULAR FOR ME TO CRITICIZE THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. I STRONGLY ADVOCATED THIS NEW STRATEGY, AND THANK GOD THIS NATION HAS BEEN GIFTED WITH ONE GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS. I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE HIM LEADING OUR MEN AND WOMEN AND TROOPS THERE IN IRAQ. MY FRIENDS, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN WHERE TIME MAGAZINE MADE VLADIMIR PUTIN THE MAN OF THE YEAR. I LOOK INTO HIS EYES AND SAW THREE LETTERS -- KGB. DEMAND OF THE YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD IS GENERAL'S PETRAEUS. WE ARE SUCCEEDING IN IRAQ. IN CASE YOU MISSED THE FRONT PAGE OF ""USA TODAY"" BAGHDAD 75 PERCENT SECURE. MY FRIENDS. AND IT HAS BEEN LONG AND HARD AND TOUGH, AND IF YOU FORGET EVERYTHING I TELL YOU TONIGHT, PLEASE REMEMBER THIS -- AL QAEDA IS ON THE RUN. THEY ARE NOT DEFEATED. BUT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU IF WE HAD DONE WITH THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO DO SIX MONTHS AGO AND SET A DATE FOR SURRENDER, A DATE FOR WITHDRAWAL, AL QAEDA WOULD BE TELLING THE WORLD TODAY THEY DEFEATED THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND WE WOULD BE CALLED ON FOR A GREATER SERVICE AND SACRIFICE BY YOUNG AMERICANS. MY FRIENDS, THANK GOD WE WENT ON THE NOSE SURRENDERED FOR, AND WE BEAT THEIR TENTS TO SURRENDER TO AL QAEDA. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. [APPLAUSE] THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. MY FRIENDS, WE ARE IN CHALLENGING TIMES. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE TRENDS AND A CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY IS THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIST EXTREMISM, WHICH TAKES MANY FORMS. IT IS THE GREATEST FORCE OF EVIL WE HAVE EVER FACED THAT IS BENT ON OUR DESTRUCTION AND OUR EXT, AND MY FRIENDS, WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER. THEY WILL SURRENDER. AND YOU MAY KNOW -- [APPLAUSE] I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT THE SUM OF A LOT AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THESE MESSAGES FROM AN OBSCURE PLACE IN EITHER PAKISTAN OR AFGHANISTAN, AND HE RECRUITS, INSTRUCTS, AND MOTIVATES THESE RADICAL EVIL PEOPLE. I WANT TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, LOOK YOU IN THE EYE -- I DO NOT CARE WHAT IT TAKES. I WILL FALL INTO THE GATES OF HELL. I WILL GET OSAMA BIN LADEN. AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WILL GET HIM, AND I KNOW HOW TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] SO THIS CHALLENGE HAS TAKEN MANY FORMS. WE HAVE HAD ARRESTS IN DENMARK AND GERMANY, DOCTORS GETTING INOCULATED WITH THIS RADICAL MESSAGE AND TRIED TO GO TO THE AIRPORT IN GLASGOW AND KILL THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. MY FRIENDS, WE STILL FACED A SUICIDE BOMBER A PROBLEM IN IRAQ. ASKED THE ISRAELIS HOW HARD IS TO COUNTER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DESTROY THEMSELVES. AS OUR GREATEST GENERATION GUYS WHO ARE HERE. WHAT WAS THE TOUGHEST OPPONENT FOR THE YORKTOWN? THE KAMIKAZE PILOTS. THERE WILL STILL BE DIFFICULTIES AHEAD ANTHEIL'S AHEAD, BUT AMERICA REMAINS DIVIDED ABOUT THIS WAR. I UNDERSTAND THAT, AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT IN GOD, NONE OF US ARE DIVIDED IN OUR SUPPORT FOR THE BRAVE YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING IN UNIFORM IN THE MILITARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WILL BE TRUE TO THEM. I KNOW THEM, AND I UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I LOVE THEM. SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR VOTING TOMORROW. I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. WHAT A GREAT EXPERIENCE IS FROM A GUY WHO STOOD FIFTH FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS CLASS AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY. MILE OFFICER WERE HERE TODAY, HE WOULD SAY IN AMERICA ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY I PROMISE YOU THAT I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THE FIRST TIME I RAISED MY HAND AND PLEDGED MY ALLEGIANCE TO THIS NATION TO DEFEND HER AGAINST ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC I WAS 17 YEARS OLD. I ENTERED THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY. MY FRIENDS, I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO KEEP THAT HOPE THAT I TOOK BACK THEIR MANY YEARS AGO. WITH YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT AND A VICTORY IN THIS ELECTION TOMORROW, I WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE THIS NATION A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?203699-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"OF GEORGE W. BUSH. PRECISELY MY VIEW. THAT'S WHY I TRIED TO RUN AGAINST HIM IN 2003. HE'S TAKEN US TO A WAR WE DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT, NENLTED A WAR WE DID HAVE TO FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN. 4,000 AMERICAN TROOPS, AN ECONOMY THAT IS SAGGING. 45 MILLION AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE. IF YOU THINK WE'VE GOT SOME CHALLENGES? YOU THINK WE'VE GOT SOME WARS TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT? DO YOU THINK WE WANT SOMEONE TO WALK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE ON DAY ONE WHO KNOWS WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO DO IT? DO WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO CAN FOCUS ON THE MISSION, WHO HAS HAD A LIFE-LONG COMMITMENT TO HELPING OTHERS, WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET WORK DONE? WE DO. AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY YES. DO WE WANT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO CAN REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER TO WORK AND SOLVE PROBLEMS? DO WE WANT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO CAN NOT ONLY INSPIRE PEOPLE, BUT ACTUALLY BRING THEM TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE GOT A REAL DEAL FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THAT SPECIAL PERSON IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON SPENT HER ENTIRE ADULT LIFE WORKING TO HELP PEOPLE. I MET HER 24 YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS THE FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS. SHE WAS AN EXPERT ON WOMEN'S ISSUES, ON HEALTH ISSUES, AND ESPECIALLY ON FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S ISSUE. SHE KNEW A RURAL ECONOMY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN ARKANSAS. SHE KNEW THE MILITARY BECAUSE SHE KNEW THE ARKANSAS NATIONAL GUARD. I WATCHED HER AS FIRST LADY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE SHE WORKED HARD ON DOMESTIC POLICY ISSUES AND SHE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. SHE WENT TO NORTHERN IRELAND IN 1999, A COUNTRY THAT HAD BEEN RACKED BY 35 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND INSPIRED THE CREATION OF A PROGRAM THAT BROUGHT IRISH WOMEN INTO POLITICS, AND IT TOOK THE IRISH WOMEN TO CONVINCE THE IRISH MEN TO STOP KILLING EACH OTHER IN NORTHERN IRELAND. AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, SHE IS ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. SHE HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO KEEP OUR MILITARY STRONG AND TO LOOK AFTER OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SERVICE WHO ARE IN THE SERVICE AND WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR COUNTRY HONORABLY AND WELL. SHE SPONSORED IMPROVEMENTS AND BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE IN THE SERVICE, IMPROVEMENTS FOR VETERANS, SHE KNOWS THE ISSUES. SHE DOES HER HOMEWORK. AS A RETIRED GENERAL, I TALK TO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. SHE KNOWS THE DETAILS. THIS IS A LEADER WHO IS READY ON DAY ONE TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. SHE'LL BE A GREAT COMMANDER AND CHIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. SHE WILL WORK DILIGENTLY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT TO HER BY GEORGE W. BUSH AND TAKE AMERICA TO NEW ACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME AND ABROAD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GIVE A STRONG RENO, NEVADA, WELCOME TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK IN RENO AND TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE NEVADA CAUCUSES. AND I KNOW -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME BECAUSE THE VOICES OF NEVADA VOTERS ARE GOING TO BE HEARD ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD. AND I THINK IT WAS WINSTON CHURCHILL WHO MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POLITICIAN AND A STATESMAN OR A STATES WOMAN IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO THINK ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION AND THOSE WHO THINK ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. AND I HOPE -- I HOPE, AS I LOOK ACROSS THIS EXTRAORDINARY CROWD AND I SEE SO MANY OF YOU WHO HAVE BROUGHT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, THAT AS YOU GO TO CAUCUS TOMORROW, WE'RE ALL THINK ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. AND WE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT EACH OF US HAS TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND BLESSINGS OF AMERICA, THIS LAND WE LOVE, WILL BE THERE NOT JUST TODAY AND TOMORROW, BUT FOR AS FAR AS WE CAN IMAGE IMAGINE. I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH GENERAL WESLEY CLARK WHO HAS SERVED OUR COUNTRY WITH SUCH DISTINCTION AND HONOR OVER SO MANY YEARS. I APPRECIATE HIS VERY KIND WORDS. I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE UP AGAINST. YOU KNOW, ON JANUARY 20th, 2009, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE SWORN IN ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITAL AT HIGH NOON. AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF US, NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF THAT THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME. AND WAITING IN THAT WHITE HOUSE WILL BE A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT CAN'T BE IGNORED, CAN'T BE DELICATED, CAN'T BE DENIED, BUT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH. AND IT'S A GREAT HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK STATE SENATOR BETTER NIECE MATTHEWS, SOMEONE WHO HAS SERVED THIS COMMUNITY WITH SUCH SUCCESS. AND, YOU KNOW, BETTER NIECE IS NOT ONLY A STATE SENATOR, SHE'S A NURSE. AND I LOVE NURSES. AND I RESPECT AND ADMIRE THE WORK THAT OUR NURSES DO FOR US DAY IN AND DAY OUT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK JOHN MAYOR, SPARK CITY COUNCILMAN WHO HAS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF MY EFFORTS. I WANT TO THANK THOENA MAUVE WHO WAS HERE ON BEHALF OF ASIAN ISLANDERS AND PICK WHO ARE SUPPORTING ME. FINALLY, I WANT YOU TO RAISE YOUR HAND, ALL OF MY VOLUNTEERS AND PRECINCT CAPTAINS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD. THANK YOU, ALL. YOU KNOW, ALL OF THIS HARD WORK LEADS UP TO ONE OR TWO HOURS TOMORROW. WHEN PEOPLE WILL GATHER IN THEIR CAUCUSES AND I HOPE ASK THEMSELVES THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. AS THEY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS WHO TO SUPPORT. FIRST, FOR ALL AMERICANS, WHO CAN BE THE BEST PRESIDENT? WHO IS READY TO SERVE AND LEAD ON DAY ONE? BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ALL THOSE PROBLEMS THAT ARE WAITING, A WAR TO END IN IRAQ AND A WAR TO WIN IN AFGHANISTAN, AND 47 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS AND $100 A BARREL OIL, AND THE PRICE AT THE GAS PUMP SEEMING TO CHANGE EVERY MINUTE AS IT GOES UP, PROBLEMS WITH OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, WHICH IS LEAVING BEHIND A LOT OF CHILDREN AND A LOT OF TEACHERS, ALL OF THE CORRUPTION AND THE NO BIG CONTRACTS, WE HAVE A LOT TO DO AS A NATION. AND WE DON'T HAVE A MINUTE TO WASTE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHO AMONG US CAN SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT AWAIT? AND, OF COURSE, I ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN IF WE WERE TO STAY HERE ALL NIGHT, LISTING EVERY PROBLEM WE THOUGHT AMERICA WOULD FACE, STARTING IN JANUARY 2009, WE WOULD MISS SOME THAT END UP IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE THE AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE INVEST IN ONE PERSON MEANS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST ELECTING OUR LEADER, BUT WE ARE ELECTING THE LEADER OF THE REST OF THE WORLD, SOMEONE WHO HAS TO BEGIN TO CHANGE DIRECTION, TO CREATE BETTER RELATIONSHIPS. SO THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION. BUT THERE'S A SECOND QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATS, LIKE-MINDED INDEPENDENTS AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE FINISHED WITH WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEARS AND THAT IS WHO CAN WIN IN NOVEMBER 2008. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. WE CAN TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING WE WANT TO DO, BUT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT UNLESS WE INAUGUST UR RATE A NEW DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT ON THAT DAY IN JANUARY 2009. SO I WANT YOU TO THINK FOR ME WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE OUR COUNTRY AND OUR WORLD LOOK LIKE IN 25 YEARS. LET'S THINK ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. LET'S THINK ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP THAT IS REQUIRED TO FIX OUR PROBLEMS, TO BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF US WANT TO SEE THE CONTINUING DRIFT THAT IS HAPPENING TO AMERICA. WE KNOW AS WE LOOK AROUND OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING SOME VERY DIFFICULT TIMES. YOU KNOW, I STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO SAYING THAT I WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BECAUSE I THINK TOO OFTEN, THOSE OF US RUNNING FOR AND IN OFFICE TALK TOO MUCH AND WE DON'T HEAR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, IN THE TIME I'VE SPENT HERE IN NEVADA, I'VE HAD PEOPLE LITERALLY SHOUT WITH ANGUISH AND PAIN OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM. I WAS HERE IN RENO A FEW DAYS AGO AND LISTENING TO A REPRESENTATIVE GROUP OF RESIDENTS OF THIS AREA TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR LIVES. ONE GENTLEMAN GOT TO AGITATED HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I'VE PAID MY INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON TIME, EVERYTHING I WAS ASKED TO DO AND I WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY JUST CANCELED MY POLICY. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, HE SAID? THEY TELL ME I HAVE TO COME UP WITH 50,000 TO HAVE AN OPERATION. HE SAID, I SPENT THAT SAVED THAT MONEY TO SEND MY KIDS TO COLLEGE AND HELP MY OLDER DAUGHTER WHO IS OUT ON HER OWN. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, HE SAID? A WOMAN FROM LAS VEGAS TOOK ME ASIDE AND SAID, SENATOR, WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME AND MY FAMILY? WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR HOME. WE'RE BEING FORECLOSED ON. I'M TOLD THE REASON I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE NEW INTEREST RATE IS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WAS TRYING TO PAY A LITTLE MORE AS I WENT ALONG. I PUT A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY IN MY CHECK FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING, THEY RAISED MY INTEREST RATE ON ME. IT'S CALLED A PREPAYMENT PENALTY. SHE SAID, NOW I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. ANOTHER WOMAN HERE IN RENO LAST WEEK TOLD ME SHE HAD GOTTEN HER MORTGAGE FROM COUNTRYWIDE, AND WHEN SHE FILLED OUT THE PAPERS, SHE SAID THERE WERE SOME THINGS IN THERE THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO HER, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE READ YOUR MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS. I HAVEN'T. YOU TALK TO PEOPLE, YOU LISTEN, YOU SAY WHAT'S IF THERE, YOU TRY TO GET THE BEST ADVICE. SHE SAID, SHE ASKED QUESTIONS. SHE SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE WRITING DOWN HERE THAT MY SALARY WILL BE UP TO $300,000 A YEAR BUT I MAKE $12 AN HOUR. AND THE BROKER SAID, THAT'S A CATEGORY THAT YOUR OCCUPATION FALLS INTO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. OF COURSE, THE PERSON WHO SOLD HER THE HOUSE WITH THAT MORTGAGE GOT A HIGHER COMMISSION BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE SET IT UP. SO SHE MAKES $12 AN HOUR AND THE INTEREST RATES KEEP GOING UP, SO SHE CALLS BACK TO COUNTRYWIDE AND SHE SAID, LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY. WHAT CAN WE DO TO WORK THIS OUT? I WORK HARD. THEY SAID, HOW ABOUT BORROWING MORE MONEY? SHE SAID, I CAN'T BORROW ANYMORE MONEY. SHE'S 64 YEARS OLD AND SHE'S ABOUT TO LOSE HER HOME. OR THE WOMAN I MET IN REASON KNOW RENO, SHE'S A SINGLE MOM AND WORKS FULL TIME. ONE OF HER SONS NEEDS AN OPERATION. THE LONGER SHE PPS IT, BECAUSE SHE CAN'T PAY FOR IT, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BECOME. SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, I MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY TO EQUAL FOYE FOR ANY KIND OF HELP. WHAT SHOULD I DO, QUIT MY JOB SO THEN I CAN QUALIFY? WHAT ARE WE DOING TO EACH OTHER YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN MISSION CLASS IS THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. IT IS THE GUARANTOR OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT AGAIN WHO WILL BE A CHAMPION FOR THE PEOPLE THAT GO TO WORK, TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND DO WHAT'S RICE TO HAVE A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. SO I'M NOT AFRAID OF HARD WORK. V I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE CHALLENGES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE IS A CHALLENGE THAT AMERICA CAN'T MEET. YOU KNOW, I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS SO FORTUNATE TO BE AN AMERICAN. MY PARENTS WORKED HARD, MY DAD WAB IN THE NAVY, CAME OUT OF WORLD WAR II, WANTED TO SAVE MONEY TO BUY A HOUSE, HAVE A BUSINESS AND START A FAMILY. HE DIDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY. BUT HE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT OUR COUNTRY WAS ON HIS SIDE. MY DAD WAS ALWAYS SUSPICIOUS OF BIG BUSINESS AND BIG GOVERNMENT. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT IS NOT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. THERE'S BEEN A TILT AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS AND HARD WORKING FAMILIES WHO DESERVE BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'VE GOTTEN! AND, YOU KNOW, FOR A WHILE, WE HEARD A LOT OF HAPPY TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. EVERY TIME I WOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY WAS NOT WORKING AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAS LOST $1,000 IN INCOME, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY WOULD COME OUT IN WASHINGTON AND SAY, WELL, LOOK AT THE STOCK MARKET. LOOK AT CORPORATE BUSINESS. AND I WOULD SAY, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG THING. WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN PEOPLE' LIVES, WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR FUTURE. WHEN SOMEBODY STANDS UP IN LAS VEGAS AND SAYS TO ME, BETWEEN ME AND MY HUSBAND, WE HAVE FOUR JOBS. IT'S PRETTY HARD TO HAVE ANYMORE THAN THAT. SO WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO PUTTING OUR PRIORITIES IN ORDER. SO HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE. YOU CAUCUS FOR ME TOMORROW. YOU GET BEHIND ME. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH YOUR HELP. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A PRESIDENT CAN'T WAVE A MAGIC WAS NOT WAND. YOU KNOW, AFTER THE SPEECHES ARE OVER AND THE TELEVISION CAMERAS ARE GONE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS. YOU HAVE TO DO THE JOB. AND I KNOW THAT IF A PRESIDENT DOESN'T TRY TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT AND MANAGE THE ECONOMY, THE GOVERNMENT WILL MANAGE THE PRESIDENT AND YOU'LL PRETTY SOON, ONCE AGAIN, HAVE GRIDLOCK AND HAVE A SENSE THAT NOTHING IS GETTING DONE BECAUSE NOBODY IS IN CHARGE. AND IF A FT. DELEGATES TOO MUCH POWER TO GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES OR OUTSIDE ADVISERS, THEN WHO ARE WE GOING TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE? I WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABILITY. I WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TAXPAYERS AND THE CITIZENS OF THE TAXPAYERS OF NEVADA. SO HERE IS WHAT I'M OFFERING. LET'S SET SOME GOALS TOGETHER. LET'S REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS. AND LET'S START BY MAKING THIS ECONOMY WORK AGAIN. NOW WE'VE GOT SOME REAL TROUBLES WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, BUT IT IS. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION. I HAVE PROPOSED A COUPLE OF MEASURES THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. NUMBER ONE, I WANT TO HAVE A MORATORIUM FOR 90 DAYS ON HOME FORECLOSURES. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN WORK OUT A LOT OF THESE LOANS SO PEOPLE DON'T LOSE THEIR HOMES. I THINK WE SHOULD FREEZE INTEREST RATES FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL DISCONNECT. YOU HAVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE DROPPING INTEREST RATES, HOME MORTGAGE RATES WHICH IS GOING TO AFFECT MORE PEOPLE CONTINUING TO GO UP. THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE MORE AND MORE FORECLOSURES, MORE AND MORE VACANT HOMES AND MORE AND MORE NEIGHBORHOODS, HOUSING VALUES DECREASE FOR EVERYBODY, EVEN IF YOU OWN YOUR HOME FREE AND CLEAR. SO I THINK WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION TO STOP THE BLEEDING IN THIS MORTGAGE CRISIS AND I'M CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO DO MORE THAN WHAT HE'S ALREADY SUGGESTED. WE NEED TO PUT SOME MONEY INTO REBATES, TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO HAVEN'T REALIZED THE BENEFITS OF THE BUSH ECONOMIC POLICY. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HAS SEEN THEIR ENERGY BILLS GO UP $2,000 IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. THAT'S THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICANS GOT FROM TAX CUTS FROM GEORGE BUSH. SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE ONE OF THOSE GAMES, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY PLAY HERE IN RENO AND THE CASINOS. YOU HAVE TO WATCH WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE. SO WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY. BUT THEN WE'VE GOT TO GET SMART ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO LONG-TERM. WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAD A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS! AND THAT HAS ALL BEEN SQUANDERED. IT IS HEARTBREAKING THAT WE WENT FROM A PROJECTED $5.6 TRILLION SURPLUS TO A $9 TRILLION DEBT. YOU KNOW, MY POOR LATE FATHER IS TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE, A MAN WHO NEVER BORROWED A PENNY AND THOUGHT THAT BEING CONSERVATIVE MEANT YOU DIDN'T SPEND WHAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE. NOW WE'VE GOT A $9 TRILLION DEBT. WE OWE MONEY TO EVERYBODY. WE BORROW MONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. THAT IS NOT A WINNING STRATEGY FOR AMERICA. WE NEED TO MOVE BACK TOWARDS FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. EVERYTHING I HAVE PROPOSED, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, ENERGY, I TELL YOU HOW I'M GOING TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT TO DISCIPLINE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU CANNOT LET IT CONTINUE, THIS RECKLESS SPENDING. AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO RECOVER SOME OF THE MONEY THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS OBLIGATED, AS WE BEGIN TO WIND DOWN THE WAR IN IRAQ. BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO GET US BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME WORK TO DO TO CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT IS GOING TO HAVE MORE AND MORE JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES. I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR US TO CREATE THOSE IN YOU NEW JOBS IN AMERICA IS THROUGH AN EXCITING COMMITMENT TO A NEW ENERGY FUTURE, CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY WILL CREATE NEW JOBS FOR NEVADA AND AMERICA. YOU KNOW, AS I DRIVE AROUND NEVADA OR FLY OVER THIS BEAUTIFUL STATE, THIS CAN BE A MODEL FOR HOW WE USE SOLAR POWER, WIND POWER, GEOTHERMAL POWER, BIOFUELS OF ALL KINDS. AND HERE IS HOW WE SHOULD PAY FOR IT. TAKE THE TAX SUBSIDIES AWAY FROM THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. THEY DO NOT NEED YOUR MONEY ANYMORE! NOW, LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS UNTIL THE TWO OIL MEN LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT I'M GETTING READY SO THAT AS SOON AS THEY DO, WE WILL BEGIN! . AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO START BEING SMART ABOUT HEALTH CARE. HEALTH CARE COSTS HAVE DOUBLED FOR MOST AMERICANS. THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED KEEP GOING UP, BUT SO DO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE INSURANCE THAT THEN DOESN'T PAY FOR WHAT THEIR DOCTORS SAY THEY NEED. I WANT TO ASK A SHOW OF HANDS. HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UNINSURED. WILL YOU RAISE YOUR HANDS? WOW. WOW. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, MAYBE YOU YOURSELF, WHO HAS INSURANCE BUT HAS HAD TO FIGHT WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO GET PAID FOR WHAT YOU NEEDED DONE? WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS PRP IT'S NOT ONE PROBLEM, IT'S TWO PROBLEMS. AND IT AFFECTS, I WOULD SAY CONSERVATIVELY, 75 MILLION AMERICANS. SO HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I HAVE PROPOSED THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN. AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE AND YOU'RE HAPPY WITH IT, NOTHING CHANGES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISRUPT ANYBODY WHO HAS WHAT THEY LIKE, IT'S AFFORDABLE, IT'S THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER, THROUGH YOUR LABOR UNION, SOME OTHER ASSOCIATION. YOU KEEP IT. BUT IF YOU ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE SMU NEW CHOICES. WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH PLAN. CONGRESS HAS A GREAT PLAN FOR ITSELF AND FOR ITS STAFF AND FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. IT HAS MORE THAN 250 CHOICES. IT HAS COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CHOICES, PREVENTION, MENTAL HEALTH, DENTAL HEALTH, THINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE. YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT RIGHT NOW, THE TAXPAYER PAYS 75% OF THE COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DEAL. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS AN ALTERNATIVE. SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS. WE'RE GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY TO PAY WHAT THEY CAN. I THINK YOU VALUE WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I WANT PEOPLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE, BUT I WANT EVERYBODY COVERED. WE'RE GOING TO TELL SMALL BUSINESS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO REQUIRE YOU TO DO ANYTHING, BECAUSE MOST SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME MAKING A PROFIT IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. BUT WE ARE GOING TO SAY IF THE SMALL BUSINESSES WANT TO COME INTO THE PLAN, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO, SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE'RE GOING TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM AND WE'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY DOING IT. YOU KNOW, WE NEED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW, I SHADOWED A NURSE IN LAS VEGAS LAST SUMMER. I WAS SO EXHAUSTED AFTER THREE HOURS. AND IT WAS AT THE END OF HER 12-HOUR SHIFT. WE LITERALLY SPENT 15 MINUTES TRYING TO READ A DOCTOR'S HANDWRITING. IT'S NOT THE DOCTOR'S FAULT. I CAN'T READ MY HANDWRITING HALF THE TIME. BUT IF IT WERE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, YOU KNOW, YOU BANK ON LINE, YOU SHOT SHOP ONLINE, WE WOULD, ACCORDING TO A CONSERVATIVE ANALYSIS, SAVE $77 BILLION A YEAR IN LOST TIME, IN DUPLICATION, IN MISTAKES. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM TO SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE WE CAN GET COSTS DOWN FOR EVERYBODY IF EVERYBODY IS IN THE SYSTEM. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? YOU GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. PEOPLE ARE WAITING THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. THEY EVENTUALLY GET TAKEN CARE OF. THEY CAN'T PAY FOR IT. THAT'S LIKE A HIDDEN TAX ON EVERYBODY WHO PAYS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE, LOWER THE COST, IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND COVER EVERYBODY. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID, WELL, IT'S CONTROVERSIAL. THIS IS CONTROVERSIAL TRYING TO COVER EVERYBODY. WELL, YEAH, I THINK I KNOW HOW CONTROVERSIAL THAT IS. I STILL HAVE THE SCARS FROM WHAT WE TRIED TO DO BACK IN '93 AND '94. BUT THAT IS WHY I'VE SPENT 14 YEARS THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE THIS TIME, BECAUSE I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL I'VE PUT FORWARD WILL ANSWER ANY OBJECTIONS THAT PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAVE. THIS IS NOT GOVERNMENT-RUN MEDICINE. THIS DOESN'T CREATE ANY NEW BUREAUCRACY. SO WHEN, IF I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE THE NOMINEE, I'M DEBATING WHOEVER THE REPUBLICANS PUT UP, THEY START TALKING LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HIGHER QUALITY AND LOWER COST AND LIMIT THE POWER OF THE DRUG AND INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE LIMITED IN POWER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. SO WHEN THE OTHER SIDE STARTS TALKING ABOUT SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, I'M GOING TO SAY, WELL, NOW, JUST EXCUSE ME, PLEASE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE? I DON'T THINK SO. THEY GET TO CHOOSE THEIR DOCTORS, THEY GET TO CHOOSE THEIR HOSPITALS. WHAT THEY HAVE IS A GUARANTEE THAT THEY'LL BE TAKEN CARE OF. IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONGRESS, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO. AND LET'S SET SOME GOALS FOR EDUCATION. EDUCATION IS THE PASSPORT TO OPPORTUNITY. I THINK WE NEED TO START IN THE HOMES. WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO HELP FAMILIES REPAIR THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR SCHOOL. YOU KNOW, THOSE LESSONS THAT YOU GET EARLY ON, I'VE DONE THIS WORK FOR 35 YEARS. THOSE ARE THE LESSONS THAT REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SOMEBODY IS HOLDING UP MY BOOK. IT TAKE A VILLAGE. YOU KNOW, I WROTE THAT BOOK TO MAKE THE POINT THAT WE HOPE EVERY CHILD, EVERY CHILD HAS A FAMILY THAT WILL LOVE THAT CHILD AND GIVE THAT CHILD THE ATTENTION AND DISCIPLINE THIS CHILDREN NEED TO GROW AND BE PRODUCTIVE. BUT WHERE THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE NEED TO HELP THOSE FAMILIES. SO I WANT TO HAVE UNIVERSAL PRE PREKINDERGARTEN. WE KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE. THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. DO YOU WANT TO CUT CRIME? IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE GRADUATION RATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, IF YOU WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE BETTER PREPARED, YOU HAVE TO START EARLY. AND THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO BECAUSE WE ARE NOW SPENDING MONEY ON THE OTHER END THAT WE COULD SAVE IF WE DID THIS RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING. AND I WILL END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. YOU SEE, YOU KNOW, FOR 35 YEARS, STARTING WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, I DID NOT WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR A LAW FIRM. I WANTED TO GO TO WORK FOR KIDS. SO I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND AND I STARTED TO WORK ON BEHALF OF ABUSED AND NEGLECTED KIDS AND KIDS WITH DISABILITIES AND KIDS WHO DIDN'T HAVE GOOD EDUCATION OR HEALTH CARE OPPORTUNITIES. AND I KNOW THAT OUR CHILDREN, OUR PRECIOUS INDIVIDUALS, THEY ARE NOT LITTLE TEST TAKERS. WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT EACH CHILD AND FIGURING OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THAT LITTLE BOY OR THAT LITTLE GIRL TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL! AND THEN, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE TO THOSE WHO WISH TO GO TO COLLEGE AND COMPLETE COLLEGE. I THINK I HAVE HEARD MORE ABOUT THIS THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE BECAUSE SO MANY FAMILIES ARE UP AGAINST IT. THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. QUALIFIED KIDS WHO WOULD HAVE GONE TEN, 20 OR 30 YEARS AGO ARE BEING SHUT OUT. HERE IS WHAT I WANTED TO. $3,500 TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY CHILD IN EVERY FAMILY IN EVERY YEAR. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE YOUR MONEY MORE EFFICIENTLY. NUMBER TWO, MORE DIRECT AID, LIKE THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM, INCREASE IT, MAKE IT MORE AVAILABLE AND GET IT QUICKLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE STUDENTS THAT NEED IT. NUMBER THREE, LET'S END THE ABUSIVE PREDATORY PRACTICES OF THE STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES THAT HAVE UPPED THE INTEREST RATES ON SO MANY OF OUR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW, I HAD TO WORK MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE, I HAD TO WORK MY WAY THROUGH LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL, I BORROWED MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT IT WAS AT LIKE 2% INTEREST. I MEET YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IN NEVADA AND THEY'RE PAYING 9% INTEREST. THAT IS NOT FAIR OR SMART. WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE NATIONAL SERVICE, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT IF THEY WORKED IN NATIONAL SERVICE FOR A YEAR OR TWO COULD GO TO COLLEGE AND KEEP DOWN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE TO BORROW. ON THE OTHER END, IF ANYBODY GRADUATES AND THEY OWE A LOT OF MONEY, FE THEY'LL FEEL LIKE AN INDENTURED SERVIENT. WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE OWING $10,000, $50,000, $100,000. I WANT TO SAY TO EVERY YOUNG NEVADAN, IF YOU DO PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU TEACH, BE A NURSE, BE A FIREFIGHTER, WE WILL FORGIVE YOUR DEBT. YOU WILL HAVE PAID IT OFF BY DOING THAT PUBLIC SERVICE. AND TIMELY, I AM GOING TO ELIMINATE THAT FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID FORM THAT FAMILIES SPEND HOURS FILLING OUT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND THERE'S NO MONEY FOR YOU, ANYWAY. IT'S A CRUEL HOPE. WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT. BUT I'M NOT JUST INTERESTED IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE. I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. 60% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NEVER GO TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATE. WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR THEM? THESE ARE THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO BUILD THE BUILDINGS WE LIVE AND WORK IN. THESE LARGELY FIGHT THE WARS THAT OUR COUNTRY WAGES. THEY GET UP EVERY DAY AND THEY WORK HARD. LET'S TAKE CARE OF THEM. SHOW THEM SOME MORE RESPECT WITH JOB TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND OTHER KINDS OF HELP. NOW, IN ORDER TO DO ANY OF THIS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT. WE ALL KNOW THAT. TO FIX OUR PROBLEMS, WE HAVE TO GET THE OBJECT STACKABLES OUT OF THE WAY. AND I'M AFRAID THAT -- SOMEBODY FAINTED. CAN WE GET SOME WATER PLEASE FROM THE BACK IF ANYBODY CAN HEAR ME? YEAH. WATER. HERE. HERE YOU GO. HERE YOU GO. GOT IT? THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU WHOEVER POINTED THAT OUT. WE'VE GOT IN NURSES, THANK GOODNESS. BRING IN THE NURSES. THANK GOODNESS. BRING IN THE NURSES. DON'T YOU JUST LOVE AMERICA? ISN'T IT JUST GREAT? YOU KNOW, WE DO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. WE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER, BUT WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. ARE YOU OKAY, HONEY? YOU'RE FINE. ARE YOU OKAY? SHE'S A LITTLE OVERHEATED. I CAN SEE WHY. YOU KNOW, I ONCE WENT ON A TRADE MISSION WITH MY HUSBAND WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. AND HE WAS TRYING TO PROMOTE TRADE WITH SOME OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND WE WERE IN FLORENCE, ITALY. AND IT WAS REALLY HOT. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHEN I TRAVEL, I SOMETIMES DON'T DRINK ENOUGH WATER. NOT A GOOD IDEA. SO I WAS BEING ESCORTED AROUND ON A GUIDED TOUR BY SOME ITALIAN OFFICIALS AND WE WENT TO SEE THE MICHAEL ANGELO DAVIS. SO I WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF IT, AND I PEELED OVER, HEAD FIRST. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I WAS SURE GLAD NOBODY WAS FOLLOWING ME AROUND IN THOSE DAYS WITH CAMERAS. YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S -- PEOPLE ASK ME, GEE, SOMETIMES YOU'RE AWFULLY CAREFUL. I SAY, OH, YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT, RIGHT? I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE. AS WE THINK ABOUT REFORMING THE GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT GEORGE W. BUSH HAS DONE. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE OUTSCATTERED SHOWERSING. I HAVE SAID THAT I WILL CUT 500,000 JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTSOURCED BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY SAVED THE TAXPAYERS MONEY AND THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTABLE. WHEN YOU OUTSOURCE MILITARY SERVICES, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, YOU END UP WITH BLACKWATER AND HALLY BURTON AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA. SO WE'RE BOG TO BEGIN TO REVERSE THAT. IF WE EVER NEEDED EVIDENCE TO WHY WE NEED A HANDS ON PRESIDENT, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS THINK BACK TO THE GULF COAST. THAT WAS A NATIONAL DISASTER THAT WAS TURNED INTO A NATIONAL DISGRACE. THE INCOMPETENT, THE INDIFFERENCE, THE SENSITIVITY, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PERSONALLY HOLD PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. I HAVE AN OLD FASHIONED IDEA. HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO START WITH, WHO CAN DO THE JOBS WE ASK THEM TO DO. AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD AND THAT BEGINS WITH BRICKING OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE CAN. I HAVE SAID SNOOUP AS SOON AS I AM INAUGURATED, I WILL ASK MY SECURITY ADVISERS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN SO THAT I CAN BEGIN TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME WITHIN 60 DAYS. SOME PEOPLE SAY TO ME, WELL, WHY DO WE HAVE TO PLAN? BECOME PRESIDENT, ASK FOR THE PLANS AND START TO DO IT. WELL, HERE IS THE PROBLEM. LAST SPRING, I BEGAN HEARING FROM A NUMBER OF THE MILITARY ADVISERS THAT I TALKED WITH THAT THE PENTAGON WASN'T DOING PLANNING. AND, IN FACT, THERE WAS RESIST I CAN'T ANSWERANCE BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT WE HAD TO START BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME. SO I WROTE TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, WITHDRAWING IS DANGEROUS AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF PLANNING WAS GOING ON. AND I GOT BACK A LETTER SAYING THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TELL ME. AND I SAID, WELL, I THINK YOU ARE. SO WE HAD A MEETING AND IT WAS CLASSIFIED SO I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY SAID EXCEPT TO TELL YOU, IT WASN'T CONFIDENCE BUILDING. SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY DIG INTO IT TO BE PREPARED, AND I WANT YOU TO JUST THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AS YOUR PRESIDENT. WITHDRAWING OUR TROOPS ALONG THOSE ROADS, ALL THOSE CONVOYS, WHICH IS HOW WE'VE ACTUALLY LOST MOST OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN, WHO HAD TO GUARD THOSE ROADS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN SOME MILITIA OR OTHER GROUP IS GOING TO PLAN AN ATTACK. WE HAVE TO GET OUR EQUIPMENT OUT. WE CAN'T LEAVE IT BEHIND. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT USE IT WOULD BE PUT TO. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE MORE THAN 100,000 AMERICAN CIVILIANS WHO ARE THERE WORKING IN THE EMBASSY, WORKING FOR BUSINESSES, WORKING FOR NONPROFITS AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. AND I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE IRAQIS WHO SIDED WITH US. A LOT OF IRAQI TRANSLATORS AND DRIVERS, YOU KNOW, AND IN 2005, I WENT INTO FALLUJA WITH JOHN McCAIN ON A SENATE TRIP. WE'RE BOTH ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. AND THE MARINES HAD JUST TAKEN BACK FALLUJA AFTER A VERY BLOODY BATTLE. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO THE YOUNG CAPTAINS AND LIEUTENANTS AND SERGEANTS WHO HAD BEEN THE LEADERS OF THAT EFFORT. ONE YOUNG MARINE CAPTAIN SAID TO ME, YOU KNOW, I AND MY MEN WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED WITHOUT OUR MARINE TRANSLATOR. NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS HE'S A MARINE TRANSLATOR AND HE'S TARGETED AND SO IS HIS FAMILY. WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WITHDRAWING, WE HAVE TO DO IT QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY. WE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME HAVE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT THE BLANK CHECK THEY'VE HAD FROM GEORGE BUSH IS NO LONGER VALID. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS THAT ONLY THEY CAN MAKE FOR THEMSELVES. WHEN WE BRING OUR TROOPS HOME, WE MUST TAKE CARE OF THEM. THEY DESERVE THE HEALTH CARE AND THE COMPENSATION THEY HAVE EARNED. I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AS A SENATOR TRYING TO CUT THROUGH RED TAPE AND FIGHT BUREAUCRACY ON BEHALF OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN I REPRESENT IN NEW YORK. YOU KNOW, I WAS OUT AT WALTE REED A FEW MONTHS AGO SEEING SOME OF OUR WOUNDED SOLDIERS, RAN INTO A YOUNG ARMY CAPTAIN, LOST HITS RIGHT ARM IN A CONVOY ATTACK AND HE LEFT THE RING FINGER ON HIS LEFT HAND WHEN HIS WEDDING RING MELTED INTO HIS FINGER. I SAID, CAPTAIN, HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE SAID, I'M DOING OKAY. BUT WHERE DO I GO TO GET MY BRAIN BACK? BECAUSE HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A SIGNATURE WOUND OF THIS CONFLICT, TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I WENT TO WEST POINT. NOBODY EVER HAD TO TAKE CARE OF ME BEFORE. NOW EVERY MORNING, MY WIFE HAS TO GIVE ME A LIST TELLING ME WHERE TO GO AND WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO. I THINK TAKEN CARE OF OUR VETERANS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES OF OUR COMMANDER AND CHIEF. I THINK OUR NEWEST VETERANS DESERVE TO GET THE MONEY THEY NEED TO START A BUSINESS AND BUY A HOME. I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF OUR VETERANS, FROM OUR NEWEST EXAMINE TO OUR OLDEST AND I WANT TO TAKE PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE VETERANS OF MY GENERATION WHO SERVED AND FOUGHT DURING VIETNAM, WHO NEVER GOT THE WELCOME, THE RESPECT AND THE SERVICES THAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE. SO WE HAVE A LOT TO DO AS A COUNTRY. BUT THAT IS WHEN WE'RE AT OUR BEST. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SET ASIDE THINGS FOR THESE GOALS AND WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST, WE CAN ACHIEVE THEM. I NEED YOUR HELP TO GO TO THOSE CAUCUSES TOMORROW, TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS. AND THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL NEED YOUR HELP WHEN I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IS NOT GOING TO BE DONE JUST BY THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, WHEN I TALK ABOUT A NEW ENERGY FUTURE, THERE'S A LOT OF WORK FOR EACH OF US TO DO TO CONSERVE MORE, BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT. I WANT YOU TO THINK EVERY TIME YOU LEAVE THE ROOM AND TURN THE LIGHT ON, THAT THAT MONEY WILL FUND REGIMES AND US. BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING. WHEN I TALK ABOUT A NEW HEALTH CARE PLAN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE UNLESS PEOPLE TAKE BETTER CARE OF THEMSELVES. YOU HAVE TO MAKE OUR KIDS EXERCISE MORE AND EAT THE RIGHT FOODS AND YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO THINK ABOUT HEALTH CARE, NOT AS SICKNESS, BUT AS WELLNESS, BECAUSE THEN WE CANNOT ONLY BE HEALTHIER AS A NATION, BUT WE CAN SAVE MONEY THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE SPENDING ON TAKING CARE OF PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I TALK ABOUT EDUCATION, I NEED FAMILIES AND STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND, WE ARE NOW IN A GLOBAL COMPETITION. THESE OTHER COUNTRIES AND INDIA AND CHINA, THEY ARE HUNGRY. THEY ARE PUTTING PEOPLE THROUGH SCHOOL, THEY ARE PUSHING KIDS TO DO MATH AND SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE A BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING. WE ALSO HAVE TO COMPETE IN A SMARTER WAY. WE'RE GOING TONED ANY BIT OF OUR TAX CODE THAT GIVES A PENNY TO ANYBODY THAT TAKES THE JOB OUT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE KNOW THAT. THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE WITH. BUT WE HAVE TO GROW THE JOBS HERE. THAT WILL TAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK HARD AND MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO AMERICA. YOU KNOW, THIS COUNTRY IS WORK FIGHTING FOR AND IT'S WORK WORKING FOR. IT WAS GIVEN TO EVERY ONE OF US MORE THAN WE CAN EVER REPAY. WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO BE AMERICANS IN 2008, BUT EVERY GENERATION IS CALLED UPON TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR GREATNESS AND OUR GOODNESS CONTINUE. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT AMERICA WILL REMAIN A GREAT NATION. CREATING OPPORTUNITY, PRESERVING THE AMERICAN DREAM, LEADING WITH OUR VALUES. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE. IT IS UP TO US. IT IS UP TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. SO IF YOU WILL STAND FOR ME, FOR ONE, MAYBE TWO HOURS TOMORROW, I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO GETS UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THINKING ABOUT YOU, THINKING THE ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES, THINKING ABOUT THE REAL LIFE KITCHEN TABLE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO CONFRONT, WHO WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP FAITH WITH NEVADA. I'M READY TO SERVE AND TO LEAD. IF YOU'RE READY TO STAND WITH ME, WE WILL, TOGETHER, MAKE HISTORY. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU! THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU ALL. (music)(music) >>>",2015-11-07 17:16:11,2008-01-18,Reno,Nevada
http://www.c-span.org/video/?203710-1/clinton-nevada-caucus-victory,Clinton Nevada Caucus Victory,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"CLINTON WHEN THE NEVADA DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. SHE SPEAKS WITH REPORTERS IN LAS VEGAS BEFORE GOING TO A CAMPAIGN STOP IN ST. LOUIS. THIS IS ABOUT 10 MINUTES. >> THIS WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY DAY WITH A WONDERFUL OUTCOME. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA WHO PARTICIPATED. THEY MADE SURE THEIR VOICES WERE HEARD. I HAD A GREAT CAMPAIGN HERE. I HAD A LOT OF WONDERFUL HELP FROM FRIENDS AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN WITH ME. I AM PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED THAT THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA HAVE GIVEN US SUCH A POSITIVE SENT OFF. THIS IS ONE STEP ON A LONG JOURNEY. WE WILL PUT OUR CASES FORD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE WILL TAKE THAT CASE TO THE PEOPLE. THIS WAS AN ESPECIALLY WONDERFUL DAY FOR ME. I WOULD BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. >> SOME ARE SAYING THAT YOUR WIN AND BROUGHT UP WAS DIRTY. THEY HAVE RECEIVED COMPLAINTS. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THESE REPORTS CUSTOMER DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE ALLEGATIONS THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN PLAYED DIRTY? >> I DO NOT HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THAT. WE HAD A VERY EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE A LOT OF REPORTS OURSELVES. WE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON THAT RIGHT NOW. THE FACT IS THAT THE PEOPLE TURNED OUT. I GOT A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE POPULAR VOTE. MY VIEW IS THAT YOU JUST KEEP GOING. THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. >> YOU GOT A LARGE SHARE OF THE POPULAR VOTE BUT TO MAY NOT HAVE WON THE DELEGATES. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE? >> NO ONE REALLY KNOWS. WE ARE LOOKING VERY GOOD. THIS IS ABOUT DELEGATES. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR AND WHO THEY THINK WILL BE THE BEST PRESIDENT. I FIND IT SOMEWHAT STRANGE THAT THERE IS SUCH A REACTION. THIS WAS A VERY EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN TO REACH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. WE DID THAT. I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. >> WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE HERE IN NEVADA? >> I THINK IT WAS THE MESSAGE OF REAL RESULTS. WE WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA SPENT A LOT OF TIME TELLING ME ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMY, HEALTH CARE, AND EDUCATION. THEY TALK ABOUT THE HOME FORECLOSURES. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A PROBLEM HERE IN NEVADA. THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA WAS SOMEONE WHO WILL GIVE THEM SOLUTIONS AND NOT JUST RHETORIC. THEY WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU DO. I'VE BEEN VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT MY PLANS. I WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT I PLAN TO DO. I WANT TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY BACK INTO THE GOVERNMENT. I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN MEET THE CHALLENGES. WE SHOULD NOT BE OVERWHELMED BY THEM. WE SHOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED. WE CAN DO THAT. THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS TOGETHER. WE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO ANALYZE THOSE THINGS. I AM VERY PROUD OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT TO SUPPORT ME AGAINST SOME VERY TOUGH ODDS. I KNOW IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THEM. I KNOW THEIR STORIES. I KNOW THERE WERE LOTS OF CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACED. THEY WERE NOT DETERRED. I REALLY RESPECT THAT. >> I SOUGHT A LOT OF INDEPENDENT VOTERS IN REPUBLICANS OUT TODAY. >> THIS IS ALL PRELIMINARY INFORMATION. I DID HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THE INDEPENDENT VOTERS. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT VOTERS IN NEVADA. I MAY WELL HAVE HAD SOME REPUBLICAN SUPPORT. ON AN ANECDOTAL BASIS, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS CAME TO MY EVENTS AT THIS PAST WEEK. THEY WOULD TELL ME IF THERE WERE REPUBLICAN AND THEY WERE SUPPORTING ME. A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE IS IN THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS. HE WROTE A COLUMN ABOUT HOW HE WAS GOING TO REGISTER AS A DEMOCRAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE. I HAVE BEEN THRILLED BY THE BROAD BASE OF SUPPORT I HAVE COMING OUT OF NEVADA. I WILL WORK VERY HARD TO CARRY NEVADA IN NOVEMBER OF 2008. >> YOU DID WELL WITH MOST OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. THE BLACKS VOTED HEAVILY FOR BARACK OBAMA. DOES THAT CONCERN YOU GOING INTO SOUTH CAROLINA? >> NO, I WILL REACH OUT TO THE VOTERS. I SEE THEM AS INDIVIDUALS. I TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I CAN DO FOR PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO ARE ECONOMICALLY WELL OFF ARE NOT AS WORRIED ABOUT HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, OR JOB SECURITY. I TRIED TO APPROACH EACH INDIVIDUAL VOTER. YOU CANNOT DO THAT PERSON BY PERSON AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO. BUT THAT IS MY MESSAGE. I AM NOT TALKING TO GROUPS OF VOTERS. I AM TALKING TO INDIVIDUALS. AND TALKING TO PEOPLE NEED A PRESIDENT. THEY NEED A CHAMPION. THEY NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL GO TO BAT FOR THEM. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING SUPPORT FROM ACROSS THE BOARD UNTIL THE END OF THE PROCESS. >> YOU AND YOUR CAMPAIGN HAS SPENT TIME QUESTIONING THE VALIDITY OF THE CAUCUS PROCESS. YOU HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS. DOES THAT TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR VICTORY? >> I AM VERY GRATIFIED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE CAME OUT TODAY. WE DO NOT HAVE THE FINAL NUMBERS YET. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO COUNT PEOPLE AT CAUCUSES. IT IS HARD TO MAKE SENSE OF THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND THE MOVEMENT. THIS WAS A VERY GOOD DAY FOR PEOPLE IN NEVADA WHO WANTED TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CAUCUSING. I MET PEOPLE TODAY WHEN I WAS VISITING AND A FEW HOTELS. THEY COULD NOT GET OFF WORK. A WOMAN CAME TO SEE ME. SHE WORKED IN ONE OF THE GIFT SHOPS. COULD SHESHE COULD NOT GET OFF WORK. CAUCUSES DO NOT PROVIDE FOR THE BROAD HIS PATIENT I HAVE FOUGHT FOR ALL MY LIFE. MY FIRST BIG JOB IN POLITICS WAS GOING TO THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY TO REGISTER HISPANIC VOTERS. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT WE WANT EVERYBODY TO PARTICIPATE. ANYTHING THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF PURGES PATIENTPARTICIPATION IS NOT IN KEEPING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. I AM GRATEFUL THAT PEOPLE SUPPORTED ME. I DO STILL HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT CAUCUSES. I DO NOT THINK PEOPLE FOCUSED ON IT BEFORE. THERE WAS NOT AS MUCH INTEREST IN SOME OF THESE CAUCUSES BEFORE HAND. PEOPLE ARE NOW FOCUSED AND WANT TO PARTICIPATE. THAT FIND OUT THEY CANNOT DO IT DURING THE TWO HOURS AVAILABLE OR THEY SHOW UP A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE DOORS CLOSE. I HEARD A STORY A FEW MINUTES AGO ABOUT THAT. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS THE COUNTRY. WE WANT TO GET EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. I AM THRILLED AT THE OUTCOME. I AM ON TUESDAY LOUITO ST. LOUIS AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.",2015-11-07 17:16:37,2008-01-19,Las Vegas,Nevada
http://www.c-span.org/video/?203701-1/huckabee-campaign-event,Huckabee Campaign Event,Mike Huckabee,"COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA FOR MORE A LIVE COVERAGE OF CAMPAIGN 2008.

IT'S GREAT TO SEE ALL OF Y'ALL OUT HERE TONIGHT. >> YOU KNOW, IF I HAD TO SUM IT UP IN A COUPLE OF THING, NUMBER ONE, A LOT OF YOU HAVEN'T EVEN DECIDE WHAT PARTY YOU ARE WHETHER YOU ARE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE HINGES YOU SEE IN MIKE HUCKABEE THAT QUITE FRANKLY DON'T SEE IN@ POLITIC, AND YOU DARN SURE DON'T SEE IT IN@ WASHINGTON. MIKE HUCKABEE FOR 134 YEARS IN ARKANSAS HAD TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE MINORITY. NOT JUST A LITTLE BIT IN d[ MINORITY. A VERY SMALL MINORITIED. HE PASSED ALL KINDS OF MON YOU MENTAL CHANGES. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PERSON TO MAKE A REAL DEMIRCHES OUR LIVES. ANOTHER THING I THOUGHT ABOUT, WITH THE DOWN TURN IN THE ECONOMY AND ALL OF US TRYING TO LOOK FOR JOB, OF COURSE, I ALMOST HAD TO LOOK FOR A NEW ON LAST YEAR. THANK Y'ALL FOR THAT. BUT MIK% HUCKABEE STARTED AT THE BOTTOM. HE DIDN'T START OUT WITH A SILVER SPOON. HE DIDN'T START WITH TH WONDERFUL GIFTS YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK FOR WHERE HE IS. YOU'LL HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS HOW TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL AND WORK OUT OF THAT. PEOPLE THAT AREN'T OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY. A LOT OF TIMES FOLKS GET OUT THERE AND FORGET WHO THEY'RE REPRESENTING WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSAS OF LOBBYIST KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR. A LOT O TIMES THEY FORGET WHO THEY ARE REPRESENTING. MIKE HUCKABEE IS A PERSON OF THE PEOPLE. LASTLY, THE BIGGEST THING, AND AGAIN, I TELL YOU APPRECIATE MY JOB, I ALMOST LOST IT TO THE GUY I'M GETTING READY TO INTRODUCE. HE'S A SCRAMBLER. I'M JUST RECOVERING FROM T. COMBU HE CAN BRING BACK ANDRE BAUER AND MIKE CAMPBELL, IMAGINE WHAT HE CAN DO WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU, I WANT TO INTRODUCE MIKE CAMPBELL, A LEADER IN THIS. >> SOMEBODY TOLD ME, THEY WERE HAVING A PARTY IN SOUTH CAROLINA TONIGHT. AND THAT WE'VE GOT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES STANDING BACKSTAGE. ARE Y'ALL READY TO HEAR FROM HIM? WELL, HE'S GOING TO BE OUT HERE IN JUST A MINUTE. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF A LOT SHOP. I KNOW WE'RE ALL HAVING A GOOD TIME. AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE A LATE NIGHT TONIGHT.

WE'RE GOING TO SEND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, T GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT HERE. WE'RE GOING TO DECIDE IT RIGHT HERE. AND IT'S GOING TO BE WITH MIKE HUCKABEE. SO BE SURE THAT YOU GET ALL YUR FRIENDS OUT TO VOT TOMORROW. BUT BEFORE WE BRING ON THE NEXT COMMANDER IN CHIEF WANT TO BRING ON A REAL GOOD FRIEND, A GUY I'VE BEEN RUNNING AROUND FOR AROUND 21 YEARS, AND HE REALLY IS NO STRANGER -- BY THE WAY HE IS A GAMECOCK, BY THE WAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> GOOD FRIENDS WITH STEVE SUPRIOR. BUT HE HAS BEEN AND NOT ONLY A GOOD FREND OF OURS, BUT2E'S BEEN A STANCH CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. AND I TELL YOU, HE REALLY NEEDS TO INTRODUCTION WORLDWIDE, AND I CAN TELL YOU HE IS STILL A WHEELING, DALING SUN OF A GUN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GIVE IT UP FOR THE NATURE BOY RICK FLYNN. AND HIS LOVELY WIFE TIFFANY! >> WHOO! I DID PRETTY GOOD, DIDN'T I GUYS? YOU KNOW, AFTER AN INTRODUCTION LIKE THAT, I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT THERE'S NO SECRET THAT I'VE LIVED A PHENOMENAL LIFE, BEEN ALL OVER THE @ WORLD, TRAVELED WITH EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD AT SOME LEVEL OR ANOTHER, BUT I'M I I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SAY THAT I TRAVELED AROUND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND I THINK I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS. IT'S PRETTY COOL. LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT. IT'S PRETTY COOL. BUT THE THING THAT -- THE THING THAT IS SO COOL ABOUT THIS IS THAT -- IT'S NOT RICK FLARE THE WRESTLER, IT'S RIC@ FLARE THE PERSON, IT'S THE RICK FLARE THAT HOPES THAT THE WORLD GETS BETTER, THAT DEALS WITH THE ISSUE, THAT SEES ALL THE CANDIDATES GOOD OR BAD IN THEIR OPINIONS, IT'S KNOWING THAT YOU CAN MEET A MAN THAT CAN TALK, BELIEVE, AND DELIVER. AND LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE CAROLINA, RIGHT? AND WE LIKE PEOPLE TO LOOK US IN THE EYE, AND WE LIKE THEM TO TELL US THE TRUTH. AM I RIGHT? WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO, YOU LOOK US IN THE EYE AND YOU TELL US THE TRUTH. AND YOU'VE GOT A PLATFORM THAT WE LI2E AND LOVE AND THAT'S WHAT MIKE HUCKABEE DOES. TAKING CARE OF THE BORDER, TAKING AIR OF OUR ISSUES OVER SEAS. GOING TO HELP THE ECONOMY. HE'S GOING TO DO EVERYTHG.

RIGHT? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MIKE HUCKABEE, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT! WHOO! AND HIS LOVEL WIFE JANET. WHOO! (music)(music) DO YOU WAKE UP ON THE PHONE WONDER WHERE YOU ARE >> THANK YOU. . THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MAKES ME WANT TO SAY WHOO! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S KIND OF NICE HAVING RICK FLARE TRAVELING AROUND AND HANGING OUT WITH YOU. AND BY THE WAY, I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT, WHICH IS GOING TO BE REALLY ON ITS WAY AS OF TOMORROW NIGHT WHEN YOU GUISE ELECT ME WINNING THE PRIMARY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU, I WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU SRT OF TUNED IN TO THE NEXT SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY RICK FLARE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> ACTUALLY, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TOMORROW, WE'RE GOING TO ALL THE POLLING PLACES. EVERYBODY THAT VOTES FOR US, GET OUR THANKS. THOSE WHO DON'T -- RICK'S GOING TO TAKE YOU DOWN. I WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR ALL O@ YOU FOR COMING OUT. I KNOW IT'S @ LATE. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. WE STARTED AFTER GETTING TO HILTON HEAD AREA ABOUT 1:30 IN THE MORNING, THEN STARTING EARLY THERE GOING TO GREENVILLE TO SPARTON BURG TO YORK COUNTY AND TO ALL THOSE PLACES IN BETWEEN, BUT IT'S BEEN THE MOST EX-ZILL RATING DAY. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY AUSE THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA ARE SENSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY TOMORROW. IT'S COME TO A CRESCENDO PEAK TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT COMPLETELY BEYOND EVERYTHING. A TOMORROW NIGHT I'LL STAND ON THIS STAGE. I'LL ONLY HAVE ONE SPEECH IN MY POCKET AND THAT'S THE VICTORY SPEECH BECAUSE WE SENS SOMETHING SPECIAL HAPPENING TOMORROW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> WE LIKE MIKE! WE LIKE MIKE. ! >> AND I LIKE YOU GUYS. THANK YOU. YOU'VE BEEN INCREDIBLE. , THE WELCOME, THE RECEPTIONS. YOU'VE ASKED TOUGH WES. I'M ASKING TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU IS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHO I AM, AND WHAT I STAND FOR. MANY, MANY WAYS I'M A LOT LIKE YOU GUY, I'M AL GUY OVER 50 LOOK FOR A JOB. 1402,000 PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE ACTUALLY LOST THEIR JOBS -- 142,000 PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. THE UNBLOIMENT RATE HAS GONE UP TO 6.6%. THE HIGHEST JUMP SINCE 1990. PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT ME ON THE STAGE AND DEER BORN, MICHIGAN WHEN AT ONE OF THE REPUBLICAN DEBATES ALL OF THEM WERE ASKED, HOW'S THE ECONOMY DOING? AND ONE BY ONE HAD SAID, OH, IT'S DOING GREAT. UNTIL THEY GOT ME. AND WHEN THEY ASKED ME, HOW'S THE ECONOMY DOING? WELL, IF YOU'RE STANDING ON THE STAGE, YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING PRETTY WELL. IF YOU'RE THE GUY IN A CORNER OFFICE OF A LARGE COMPANY, YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING GREAT. YOU'RE THE ONE DRIVING THE TRUCK, IF YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S HANDLING THE BAG, AND QUITE FRANKLY, YOU ASK THOSE FOLK, THEY TELL YOU IT'S NOT DOING SO GOOD. BECAUSE MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, THE PEOPLE WHO WORK VERY HARD AND LITERALLY ARE LIVING FROM ONE PAYCHECK TO THE NEXT, AND ARE ONE MISSED PAYCHECK AWAY FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY TH RENT, NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEIR KID IFER IF HE FALLS ON THE PLAYGROUND AND BREAKS HIS TRUCK. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO PUT GAS IN THEIR TRUCK BECAUSE THI YEAR IS 808 CENTS HIGHER. FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING IN THE MIDDLE-CLASS THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING. EY ARE WORKING HARDER THIS YEAR. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT'S LIKE THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT INSTEAD OF WORKING TO HELP FACILITATE THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM AND FACILITATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION AS ACTUALLY COMPLICATED IT. EVEN THOUGH 0% OF ALL JOBS COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS. ASK WHAT THEY'RE GREATEST CHALLENGE IS. THEY'LL TELL YOU THEIR TOUGHEST COMPETITORS IS NOT THE GUY ACROSS TOWN OR EVEN ACROSS THE OCEAN, THEY'RE TOUGHEST COMPETITOR IS THEY'RE OWN GOVERNMENT WHO TAX STATION, REGULATION, AND LITIGATION MAKES IT INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED. IT OUGHT NOT TO BE THAT HARD TO TAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM AND MAKE IT WORK. AND THE THAT'S WHAT HAS TO STARTED WORKING IN THE COUNTRY. THAT EMPOWER YOU RATHER THAN EMPOWER THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG. PEOPLE GET TO WASHINGTON AND FORGET WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD BECAUSE THEY DON'T. YOU HAVE TO DECIDE TOMORROW, DO YOU WANT TO SEND SOMEBODY TO WASHINGTON WHO'S ALREADY THERE, WHO'S A PART OF IT? YOU HAVE TO ASK IF THEIR -- A PERSON WHO'S BEEN THERE A LONG TIME AND THEY HAVEN FIXED IT YET, WHY DO WE THINK THEY'VE COME UP WITH A WAY TO FIX IT NOW? I'VE GOOD BETTER IDEA, GIVE SOMEBODY A CHANCE THAT'S BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THOSE ISSUES LIKE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, FOR 10 AND A HALF YEARS IN ARKANSAS LOOKING AT A ROAD SYSTEM THAT NEEDED TO BE REBUILT, LOOKING AT SCHOOLS WITH CHILDREN NOT GIVEN ADEQUATE EDUCATION, PENALIZE SENIORS FOR GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE THEY'RE PAID OFF HOME SAW THEIR PROPERTY TAXES KEEP GOING UP. SO WE STARTED CUTTING THOSE TAXES AND INDEXES THE INFLATION. CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAXa ELIMINATED THE MARRIAGE TAX. AND THEN WE STARTED RECOGNIZING AT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE NEEDED TO IMPROVE OUR STATE COMBI REABILL -- REABILL TATING OUR OHIO SYSTEM AND WE DID. FINALLY DECIDING ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH. LET'S MAKE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WORK. AND SO WE DID. AND OUR SCHOOLS WENT FROM SOME OF THE WORSE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE WE JUST USED TO BE PROUD WE'RE NOT DEAD LAST, TO THIS WEEK BEING NAMED THE 8TH BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF DIRECTION THAT AMERICA NEEDS TO GO. >> PART OF WHAT WE DID WAS WE'LL SAY THAT WE'LL PAY TEACHERS MORE. AND WE'VE UNLEASHED WEBS OF MA INSTRUCTION MAKING SHOE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BRAIN WAS DEVELOPED BUT INSISTING AND ENSURING THAT EVERY STUDENT HAD AN EDUCATION IN MUSIC AND ART BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE CREATIVE AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN GET'S STIMULATED. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHEN 6,000 KIDS IN AMERICA DROP OUT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE DUMB, IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE BORED. THAT OUGHT TO CHANGE. WE'VE BEEN PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON THAT IF THEY COULD HAVE FIXED THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE, THEY WOULD HAVE. I PROMISE YOU WE'LL HAVE A TRUE BORDER. IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO COME TO AMERICA, IT'S JUST THAT WHEN THEY DO COME, WE WANT THEM TO CE THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND DO IT LEGALLY. WE THANK GOD EVERY DAY THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BREAK INTO OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD COUNTRY. I WOULD WANTED TO COME HERE TOO. THEY SHOULDN'T JUMP AHEAD OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PATIENTLY WAIT. AND WHEN PEOPLE COME HERE ON A VISA, IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILI TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T EXTEND THE STAY. EVERY LAST ONE OF THE HIJACKERS HAD BEEN GIVEN A PERMIT BYORY OWN GOVERNMENT. THEY WERE ALLOWED TO COME IN. IT WAS STAMPED. BUT 63 PIECES OF FAKE I.D. LATER AND THOSE HIJACKERS HAD DONE THE UNTHINKABLE. AND THEY DID IT HAVING BEEN ALLOWED TO COME BECAUSE HALF OF THE ILLEGALS IN THIS COUNTRY DIDN'T SLIP THROUGH THE BORDER UNDETECTED, THEY CAME RIGHT THROUGH AND GOT THEIR CARD STAMPED. BUT NOBODY EVER CHECKED ON THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WHAT WASHINGTON SAYS ABOUT THAT? WELL, WE JUST DON'T KNOW HO TO DEAL WITH IT. >> A LOT OF YOU HAVE ORDERED STUFF FROM AMAZON.COM. GUESS WHAT? ONCE YOU MAKE THAT ORDER, YOU CAN TRACK WHAT YOU ORDER FROM THE TIME IT LEAVES TO THE WAREHOUSE TO GET THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO GET TO THE TRUCK, RIGHT TO YOUR FRONT DOOR. YOU CAN TRACK THAT BOOK FROM THE TIME IT LEAVES THE WAREHOUSE UNTIL I TRABBLINGS YOUR DOOR WITHIN 50 FEET OF WHERE IT IS. SO IT OCCURRED TO ME IF OUR GOVERNMENT WITH ALL OF I WAS ITSELF RESOURCE SAYS THAT IT CAN KEEP OUT TO -- KEEP TRACK OF IT, WELL, THEN LET'S OUTSOURCE IT TO FEDEX AND U.P.S. BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THE WOR DONE. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU WHEN YOU GET OUT OF SCHOOL, WILL YOU HAVE A JOB OR JUST A HUGE DEBT HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD? AND QUITE FRANKLY, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND JOBS SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A DIPLOMA, NO JOB, BUT AN AMAZING BANK NOTE THAT ILL TAKE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE TO PAY OFF. GETTING OUT OF COLLEGE MEANS THAT YOU HAVE THE CHANCE FOR THE KIND OF JOB THAT GIVES YOU ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, PROSPERITY AND@ OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE HAVE TRAINING PARTNERS IN OUR FREE TRADE THAT DON'T PLAY FAIR, IT'S NOT FREE ANYMORE. I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE. BUT I BELIEVE IN FAIR TRADE WHERE BOTH PARTIES PLAY BY THE SAME RULES AND WE DON'T KEEP LOSING JOBS, PEOPLE OVERSEA, BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING THIS COUNTRY HAS GOT TO BE ABLE TO FEED ITSELF. IT'S GOT BE ABLE TO FUE ITSELF WITH ITS OWN ENERGY RESOURCE, AND IT'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR ITSELF SO THAT IF WE VE TO WE CAN BUILD OUR OWN AIRPLANE, AND TANK, AND THE WEAPONS OF DEFENSE, OTHERWISE, IT'S NOT JOBS WE'VE OUTSOURCED. WE'VE OUTSOURCED OUR FREEDOM. THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOUR, I'M GOING TO ASK EVERY ONE OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU NOT ONLY VOTE, I'M EVEN ASK YOU TO VOTE @ EARLY, AND VOTE AUVE. THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IT IN ARKANSAS. GIVET IT A TRY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. NOW, SOME POLITICIANS GET UP AND SAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU VOTE FOR AS LONG AS YOU JUST VOTE. WELL, I'M GOING TO LET SOMEBODY ESSAY THAT BECAUSE I'LL GOING TO TELL YOU, IT MATTERS WHO YOU VOTE FOR. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, STAY HOME. MAKE A PO OF CHILI. . STAY HOME. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU FEEL, GET UP, GET TO THE POLLS AND VOTE. AND TAKE SOMEBODY WITH YOU WHO'S GOING TO VOTE FO ME. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY TOMORROW NIGHT. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID WE CAN'T RUN THIS CAMPAIGN WHEN I'M BEING OUTSPEND BY 20-1 BY SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES. YOU KNOW WHY IT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE I AMERICA WHO WANT A VOICE FOR THEM. I WANT TO BE THE PEOPLE WHO SERVE THEM. BUT I'M NOT SURE THEY NEED THE SAME VOICE, BECAUSE THEY'LL FIND A WAY TO HAVE THEIRS HEARD. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT NEED TO KNOW THAT A PRESIDENT REMEMBERS EVERY DAY THERE'S A WORLD OF HURT OUT THERE. #OK, I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO STRUGGLE I CAME UP IN A FAMILY, LIFE WASN'T ALL THAT EASY. I WAS BORN OUT OF TWO PARENTS WHO CAME OUT OF DEPRESSION IN A WORLD WAR. MY FATHER WAS A FIREFIGHTER. IT'S WHAT HE DID FOR ALYING. BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH MONEY. ON HIS DAYS OFF HE WAS A MECHANIC. MY DAD NEVER FINISHE HIGH SCHOOL. BENEATH DID HIS DAD OR HIS DAD BEFORE HIM. IN FACT, I WAS THE FIRST MEAL IN MY FAMILY TO FINISH. MY MOTHER WAS THE OLDEST OF SEVEN KIDS. THEY INSTILLED IN US A WORK ETHIC AND ALSO THE D IDEA THAT AN EDUCATION WOULD BE A TICKET TO LIVE IN A BETTER LIFE. I PAID MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE WORKING 40 HOURS A WEEK. I GOT THROUGH IN TWO YEARS AND THREE MONTHS. I COULDN'T AFFORD TO STAY THERE FOR FOUR YEARS. I DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK, OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE. NO THAT'S WONDERFUL. BECAUSE I LEARNED IN THIS COUNTRY THAT A KID LIKE NE M.E. COULD NOT ONLY GET THROUGH COLLEGE BUT DREAM GREAT DREAMS AND SEE THEM COME TRUE. BUT I WAS 8 YEARS OLD, MY DAD TOOK ME TO HEAR A SPEECH BY THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS WHO'S COMING TO OUR PART OF E STATE TO DEdICATE A LAKE. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. HE SAID SON, I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN d[THERE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE GOVERNOR TALK. SON, YOU MAY NEVER SEE A GOVERNOR IN PERSON. LITTLE DID MY DAD KNOWN THAT HIS SON WOULD BECOME THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WITH YOUR HELP TOMORROW I'LL BE WELL ON MY WAY TO BECOMING THE 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY. GO BLESS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT! THANK YOU . [APPLAUSE] >> WE LIKE MIKE. >> THANK YOU. >> WE LIKE MIKE! >> THANK YOU. >> WE LIKE MIKE! >> LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?203708-1/huckabee-south-carolina-primary,Huckabee South Carolina Primary,Mike Huckabee,"THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU AN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.D THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. >> HUCKABY! >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELL, JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, I MADE A PHONE CALL TO SENATOR McCAIN AND I OFFERED HIM MY CONGRATULATIONS. I HOLD HIM THAT I MUCH RATHER PREFER THAT HE HAD CALLED ME TONIGHT. BUT HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS, AS WE KNEW HE WOULD BE, AND I WAS CERTAINLY WILLING TO COMPLIMENT HIM. I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR RUNNING A CIVIL AND A GOOD AND A DECENT CAMPAIGN, TO ELEVATE POLITICS AND HE'S TO BE CONGRATULATED. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M PROUD OF, THOSE OF US, THE TWO OF US, WHO FINISHED AT THE TOP, RAN A CAMPAIGN WITH A LEVEL OF CIVILITY, WITHOUT ATTACKING EACH OTHER, AND EVEN THOUGH I'D LIKE FOR THE OUTCOME TO BE JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT ON THE TOP AND IN THE SECOND PLACE, I HAD RATHER BE WHERE I AM AND HAVE DONE IT WITH HONOR, THAN TO HAVE WON WITH THE DISHONOR OF GETTING THERE BY ATTACKING SOMEBODY ELSE AND I'M GRATEFUL. [ APPLAUSE ] I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE CAMPAIGN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WILLING TO RUN WITH ME AND GRATEFUL FOR THE CAMPAIGN THAT HE HAS RUN AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT, WE WANTED TO COME HERE AND TO DECLARE A SOUTH CAROLINA VICTORY. WE GOT AWFUL CLOSE. UNFORTUNATELY, IN POLITICS, CLOSE DOESN'T COUNT FOR THE FIRST SLOT, BUT IT DOES COUNT. AND THE REASON THAT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TONIGHT IS TO REMIND YOU THAT POLITICS, AND PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR MORE THAN PERHAPS ANY OTHER, THIS IS NOT AN EVENT. IT IS A PROCESS. AND THE PROCESS IS FAR, FAR FROM OVER. [ APPLAUSE ] OBVIOUSLY I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO OUR SOUTH CAROLINA TEAM, WORKING THEIR HEARTS OUT. MIKE CAMPBELL, OUR STATE CHAIRMAN, HIS WONDERFUL MOTHER IRIS CAMPBELL, I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. TO MY FRIEND, FORMER GOVERNOR DAVID BEASLEY AND HIS WIFE MARY WOOD, ONCE AGAIN STUCK HIS NECK OUT AND JUST WAS ABLE TO CAMPAIGN WITH ME ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND I JUST WANT TO THANK HIM ALSO FOR JUMPING IN AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING HIM ON THE TRAIL AND OTHER PLACES AS WELL. [ APPLAUSE ] LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ANDRE POWER AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO ENDORSE US THIS WEEK AND IN MANY WAYS I BELIEVE WE WILL LEAVE SOUTH CAROLINA NOT ONLY WITH INCREDIBLE NUMBERS OF FRIENDS, BUT I BELIEVE WITH THE RENEWED UNITY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, BRINGING THESE TWO MEN, MIKE CAMPBELL AND ANDRE BOUER WITH TO THE SAME STAGE ARRANGE BOTH OF THEM HAVE AN INCREDIBLY GRATE FUTURE, AS DOES SOUTH CAROLINA A MUST WONDERFUL STATE. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.WONDERFUL STATE. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.SOUTH CAROLINA A MUST WONDERFUL STATE. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE. I CANNOT BEGIN TO SAY THANKS ENOUGH TO OUR STAFF. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE, HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WEEKS A PERSON CAN GO WITHOUT SLEEP, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO TEST THE OUTER LIMITS BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER. MOST CAMPAIGNS HAVE THREE PEOPLE TO ONE THAT WE HAVE ON OUR STAFF AND THEY HAVE JUST WORKED NOT WITH COMPLAINT BUT WITH A COMMITMENT I'VE NEVER SEEN EVER. MANY OF YOU HAVE COME HERE ALL OVER AMERICA AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. WE'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT LITERALLY HAVE MADE PHONE CALLS FOR US, SOME OF WHOM ARE IN EUROPE, AND THEY'VE USED THEIR FREE CELL PHONE WEEKEND MINUTES TO MAKE CALLS BACK TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME VOTE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. LET ME JUST SAY THAT TONIGHT IS NOT A TIME TO START ASKING WHAT IF. IT'S A TIME TO START TALKING ABOUT WHAT NOW. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT AROUND AND SECOND GUESS, WHAT IF WE HAD. I FEEL LIKE OUR EFFORT HERE, WE GAVE EVERYTHING WE HAD. WE LEFT IT ALL ON THE FIELD. I DON'T WANT ANYONE WHO WORKED IN THIS CAMPAIGN FROM OUR VOLUNTEERS TO OUR STAFF TO FEEL ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF PRIDE AND ALSO A SENSE OF JUST SHEER JOY THAT WE GOT AS FAR AS WE DID WHEN NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO BE IN CONTENTION. [ APPLAUSE ] LET ME TELL YOU AND REMIND YOU HOW WE GOT HERE. IT WASN'T BECAUSE WE HAD THE MOST MONEY, THE MOST CONSULTANTS, THE MOST STAFF, THE MOST RESOURCES, THE MOST POLLS, THE MOST FOCUS GROUPS. HERE'S WHAT WE HAD. WHAT WE HAD WAS WE HAD A MESSAGE THAT HAS CONNECTED AND CONTINUES TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE FEARED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN AND HAVE BECOME INVISIBLE TO MANY POLITICAL PEOPLE. AND THEY FEAR THAT MAYBE THEY MATTERED JUST AS MUCH BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY WANT, IS THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL TAKE THE HEAVY BURDEN OF TAXATION OFF THEIR BACKS. THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL START THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY IT'S SPENDING AND STOP IT AND FINALLY START ACTING WITH SOME LEVEL OF SANITY WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING THE VERY DOLLARS THEY'VE TAKEN FROM US. PEOPLE WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT RECOGNIZES THAT MOTHERS AND FATHERS REALLY DO RAISE BETTER CHILDREN THAN GOVERNMENTS DO AND THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT LEAVES THEM ALONE SO THEY CAN RAISE THEIR CHILDREN AS THEY SEE FIT. NOT WITH THE GOVERNMENT TELLING THEM HOW. [ APPLAUSE ] THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT WHO WILL FINALLY BUILD A FENCE, SECURE OUR BORDERS, AND CONFRONT THE ISSUE, NOT JUST OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, BUT CONFRONT THE GREATER ISSUE THAT IS PLAGUING SO MANY PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE REST OF AMERICA AND THAT IS THE FEAR THAT TOMORROW THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS. AND NOT BE ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE AND CLOTHES ON THEIR KIDS' BACKS. FOR EVERY PERSON OUT THERE SERVING THE FOOD AND DRIVING THE TRUCKS AND SITTING IN THE FRONT OF THE CABS AND NOT THE BACK SEAT, FOR THE ONES WHO ARE ON THE LINES OF THE FACTORIES AND CLIMBING UP AND DOWN THE LADDERS, CARRYING PAINT BUCKETS IN THEIR HANDS AND HAMMERS, WE WANT TO BE A CAMPAIGN THAT SAYS THERE'S ROOM IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR YOU AND, IN FACT, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS THE BEST KIND OF FUTURE. AND THAT MESSAGE AND THAT MISSION IS FAR FROM OVER TONIGHT. AND THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT US TO LEAVE HERE SAYING, WELL, THE GAME HAS ENDED. NO, WE'VE JUST FINISHED ONE OF THE QUARTERS OF PLAY. MY DEAR FRIEND WHO I LOVE TO QUOTE ON OCCASIONS LIKE THIS, WHO'S A SOUTH CAROLINIANS, I LOVE WHAT HE SAYS, HE SAYS, I'VE NEVER LOST AT ANYTHING I'VE EVER DONE. SOMETIMES THE GAME ENDS BEFORE I GET FINISHED PLAYING, BUT I'VE NEVER LOST AT ANYTHING I'VE DONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, WE DIDN'T LOSE TONIGHT. GAME ENDED A LITTLE EARLY FOR US. BUT I ALSO WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS. THE PATH TO THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT ENDING HERE TONIGHT. WE'RE RESETTING THE CLOCK. WE'RE RESETTING ALL OF THE GAUGES. WE HAVE LEARNED AND TOMORROW, AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF SLEEP, WE WAKE UP TO FIGHT THE BATTLE YET AGAIN AND YET AGAIN, AND I STILL BELIEVE A YEAR FROM NOW, ALL OF YOU THAT HAVE HELPED US GET THERE, WILL BE IN WASHINGTON FOR THE INAUGURATION OF THE 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] LET HE ME SAY A FINAL WORD OF THANKS TO MY WIFE JANET AND MY CHILDREN, IT'S TOUGH TO RUN FOR OFFICE. THE ONLY THING MORE DIFFICULT THAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS TO BE MARRIED TO THE GUY WHO DOES. AND SHE'S BEEN WILLING AND READY AND HAS GIVEN HER ALL AND HAS NEVER FLINCHED IN HER UNDYING SUPPORT FOR WHAT WE'RE ABOUT. I WANT TO SAY TO EVERY ONE OF YOU, HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU, HOW MUCH WE THANK YOU, THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN MAGNIFICENT TO US. YOUR HOSPITALITY, YOUR WARMTH, YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT, THE ENTHUSIASM AND EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR US, I JUST CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU WHAT A DEEP AND WONDERFUL IMPRESSION YOU'VE LEFT WITH US.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?203772-1/clinton-economic-policy,Clinton Economic Policy,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"EARLIER TODAY, SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON DELIVERED A SPEECH ON THE ECONOMY IN GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA. AHEAD OF THAT DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY ON SATURDAY. SENATOR CLINTON IS 15 POINTS BEHIND SENATOR OBAMA IN THE LATEST C. STEMPEL. THIS WAS ONE OF TWO CAMPAIGN STOPS ON HER SCHEDULE TODAY. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE AT THIS TIME WELLCOME SECRETARY DICK RILEY AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] >> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. I'M DICK RILEY AND I APPRECIATE THAT HAND. YES, PLEASE SIT DOWN. HILLARY WAS ON THE WAY HERE AND I WANT HER TO KNOW, I KNOW FRANK ENTERTAIN YOU ALL FOR A MINUTE AND FRANK CAME TO WASHINGTON AND IN THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TO ENDED UP BEING MY DEPUTY NUMBER TWO PERSON. A GREAT HILLARY SUPPORTER AND ALSO PROUD OF GIBSON AND FLETCHER SMITH AND OTHERS WHO PRESENTED THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER AND AMAZING GRACE. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> WE HAVE A BIG MESSAGE. I WANT TO SAY THIS, I'M PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE CO-CHAIRS OF THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN IN SOUTH CAROLINA. AND I HAVE NOT HILLARY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, WORKED CLOSELY WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS THE FIRST LADY AND IN ARKANSAS WORKING HEAVY ON EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, A LOT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY ISSUES AND FRIENDS ALSO. AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO WASHINGTON TO SERVE AS THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, I SAW THIS PERSON, A THINKER, A SERIOUS MINDED, VERY BRIGHT PERSON, WORKING ON ISSUES THAT AFFECT PEOPLE, OF COURSE I DEALT WITH PRIMARILY EDUCATION, THE PELL GRANTS INCREASE, DIRECT LOANS, SO STUDENTS CAN AFFORD COLLEGE, ALL OF THE OTHER COLLEGE WORK STUDY, HOPE SCHOLARSHIPS, ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SHE'S GOING TO TALK I THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC SITUATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS VERY, VERY SERIOUS. SOMETHING SHE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT. SOME THINK THAT IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO EDUCATION AND ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD TODAY. AS I PRESENT TO YOU NOW A PERSON I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR, LET ME SAY THIS AS I CLOSE MY INTRODUCTION. I WAS IN COLUMBIA THE OTHER DAY AND WENT BY TO SEE HILLARY, SHE WAS GOING TO BE ON TIM RUSSERT. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. SO I GREETED HER BEAR, TOLD HER MY WIFE WAS IN HOSPITAL HAVING SOME EXAMINATION PROCEDURE AND COLUMBIA. SHE SAYS WELL I'M GOING TO CALL YOU UP AND I SAID WAIT A MINUTE HILLARY, YOU GO ON THE PRESS FOR AN HOUR, DRILLED WORLD WIDE AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL, SHE SAID I'M GOING TO CALL AND WISH HER WELL. THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON SHE IS. SHE IS OUR FRIEND, SHE'S YOUR FRIEND, AND I WISH SHE COULD BE PRESIDENT TOMORROW. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, THANK YOU. [CHEERING] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ALL, SO MUCH. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I, I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK HERE AT FURMAN UNIVERSITY. I WAS HERE WITH DICK FRI BACK IN 2003 FOR A SPEECH AND QUESTION AND ANSWER PROGRAM THERE AND I HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME AND IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN AT ONE OF THE EXTENSION BUILDINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THIS CAMPAIGN BUT TO BE BACK AND TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING OUR COUNTRY IS A GREAT HONOR. I'M SO SORRY TO BE LATE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. SOME OF IT WAS OFF TO A LATE START BECAUSE OF OTHER THINGS WE HAD TO DEAL WITH AND SOME OF IT WAS JUST A DELAY IN AIR TRAVEL BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND WILLINGNESS TO BE HERE. I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYBODY STUCK OUTSIDE. WE HAVE A LONG, LONG THE LINE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET IT. I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY THOUGHT A SPEECH ABOUT THE ECONOMY WOULD DRAW SUCH A BIG CROWD. SO I APOLOGIZE TO ALL OF YOU AS WELL. AND OF COURSE I WANT TO THANK DICK RILEY FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND OUR COUNTRY. HE IS SUCH A UNIT PUBLIC SERVANT AND A GREAT MAN. [APPLAUSE] AND I WANT TO THANK FRANK PARLIAMENT WHO WAS NOT SPEAKING HERE WITH YOU BEFORE AND BODY GIBSON, STATE REPRESENTATIVE FLETCHER SMITH WHO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE SUPPORTING ME. I WANT TO THANK THE CONFERENCE CENTER HERE AND PAY NIELSEN, THE DIRECTOR, AND ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE COME. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO THANK A GROUP OF VETERANS TRAVELING THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON MY BEHALF. WE HAVE THEM ALL OVER THE STRAIT. WE OF SEVERAL OF THEM HERE TODAY. LED BY THE FORMER SECRETARY OF VETERAN AFFAIRS, HANK IN IRAQ, A VETERAN AND A STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM MASSACHUSETTS, PAT LEWIS, ANOTHER VETERAN, AND LOUIS BROWN ANOTHER SUPPORTER. I'M VERY PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY OF OUR VETERANS. [APPLAUSE] WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THAT FRONT AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE DETAILS, TALK TO HERSHEL AND VETERAN'S HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN GET A CHAPTER AND VERSE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO KEEP FAITH WITH OUR VETERANS. BUT I WANT TO TURN TO THE ECONOMY. YOU KNOW, IN JUST A FEW DAYS ON MONDAY NIGHT, PRESIDENT BUSH WILL GIVE HIS FINAL STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT TO BURST OUT IN A SONG. [LAUGHTER] BUT DON'T WORRY, I WILL SPARE YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME SING. BUT AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF INATTENTION, NEGLECT, AND THIS THE WHILE, THIS MONDAY NIGHT, PRESIDENT BUSH MAY ACTUALLY WILL DISCUSS THE SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE, AND IT'S ABOUT TIME. YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM WHEN THE TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILIES INCOME DROPPED $1,000 OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. $2,600 FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES. AS HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS NEARLY DOUBLED, GAS PRICES MORE THAN DOUBLED AND COLLEGE COSTS HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA ROSE 124% SINCE 2000. THE FASTEST INCREASE IN AMERICA. WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM AS MORE THAN 2 MILLION FORECLOSURE NOTICES WENT OUT. A 11,000 PROPERTIES RIGHT HERE. IN SOUTH CAROLINA ARE IN SOME STAGE OF FORECLOSURE. THAT'S 11,000 FAMILIES THAT ARE FACING THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM AS UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED A TWO-YEAR HIGH LAST MONTH WITH SOUTH CAROLINA HAVING THE THIRD HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN AMERICA. OR AS NEARLY 5 MILLION AMERICANS FELL BACK INTO POVERTY. 33,000 IN SOUTH CAROLINA ALONE. BUT NOW FINALLY THE PRESIDENT MAY ACKNOWLEDGE WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT BUDDY ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES. AND I WELCOME THE PRESIDENT TO THIS CONVERSATION. BECAUSE IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT AMERICANS HAVE BEEN HAVING AND I'VE BEEN HAVING WITH SO MANY PEOPLE EVERY DAY FOR YEARS. I'VE LISTENED TO THE VOICES OF SO MANY AMERICANS AS I'VE TRAVELLED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD ALL DAY, THEN SOMETIMES, ADDITIONALLY ON THE NIGHT SHIFT. BUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH. PEOPLE WHO WHISPER TO ME ABOUT THE MORTGAGES THEY CAN'T AFFORD, THE HOMES THEY ARE LOSING. ABOUT MEDICAL BILLS THAT WIPED THEM AND THEIR SAVINGS OUT. ABOUT TUITION COSTS THAT HAVE CUT SHORT HOPES THE HAD OF SENDING A CHILD TO COLLEGE. MANY PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THEY CONFRONT EVERY DAY. I'VE HEARD FROM PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ALSO TELL ME WELL, OKAY RIGHT NOW. BUT WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEAR? OR EVEN NEXT MONTH? AWAY THINGS ARE GOING WITH PEOPLE LOSING JOBS AND HOMES, WHAT IF MY FAMILY IS NEXT? THIS IS A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY AND A GROWING ANXIETY. WE DIDN'T WIND UP HERE BY ACCIDENT. AS PRESIDENT KENNEDY ONCE OBSERVED, ECONOMIC POLICY CAN RESULT FROM GOVERNMENT INACTION AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT ACTION. WE ARE HERE IN PART BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT FAILED TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING, FAILED TO GET INVOLVED IN THE ACT WILL WORK OF RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT, AND FAILED TO ACT. INSTEAD, HE HAS STAYED AT A COMFORTABLE CRUISING ALTITUDE. WELL ABOVE THE REALITIES OF PEOPLE'S LIVES. DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITIES TO HIS ADVISERS, HOPING THE BUCK WOULD STOP SOMEWHERE ELSE. ANYWHERE ELSE. IN JUST SEVEN YEARS, THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN US FROM RECORD SURPLUSES INTO A LARGE AND GROWING DEFICIT. FROM A PROJECTED $5.6 TRILLION SURPLUS TO A $9 TRILLION DEBT. WE HAVE SEEN OUR GROWING, THRIVING ECONOMY THAT CREATED 22.7 MILLION JOBS IN THE 1990'S PUSHED TO THE BRINK OF RECESSION. AND WE ARE SEEING IF THE RIPPLE EFFECT AROUND THE WORLD. THIS WEEK, MANY COUNTRIES SAW THEIR LARGEST ONE A DAY STOP MARKET DECLINE SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. IN THIS NEW CENTURY, THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER, THE CHALLENGES HAVE NEVER BEEN BIGGER OR MORE URGENT. BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALSO THERE IF WE GET ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF SEIZING THEM. NOW, OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OR AT MEDICALLY COMPLEX BUT THERE IS ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE. THE PROBLEM WITH OUR ECONOMY IS NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. INSTEAD, THE PROBLEM IS IN PART THE BANKRUPT IDEAS THAT HAVE GOVERNED US FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. THEY HAVE REWARDED THE VERY FEW AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MANY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY THE SOLUTION TO OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. AMERICANS ARE THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. OUR PRODUCTIVITY GOES UP EVERY YEAR. THAT MEANS WE WORK HARDER AND HARDER AND PRODUCE MORE. PEOPLE ARE INNOVATORS, OF JAPAN NUMEROUS, THEY TAKE RISKS, THEY START SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY ARE CONSTANTLY THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. THE FACTORY WORKER AND THE CEO, THE FORMER ARE THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, THE SCIENTIST IN THE LAB OR THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM, EVERYBODY WHO GETS UP EVERY DAY AND GETS THEIR JOB DONE SUPPORTS THEIR FAMILIES. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. AND IT'S TIME WE FINALLY HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WORKED AS HARD FOR YOU AS YOU WORK FOR AMERICA EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] IN THE END IT IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE WOMAN IN COLOMBIA WHO GRABBED MY HAND AND SAID HER CHILD WAS SICK AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY WOULDN'T PAY FOR THE TREATMENT THAT WAS NECESSARY. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MAN AND FLORENCE WAS SOME MONTHS AGO WHO SAID TO ME I JUST KEEP WORKING HARDER AND HARDER AND FEEL LIKE AND FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BACKWARDS. HE SAID I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS. I DEPEND ON TRANSPORTING MY GOODS AND THE COST OF ENERGY JUST KEEPS GOING UP. IT'S ABOUT THE REAL LIVES OF REAL PEOPLE LIVE HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THE PRESIDENCY MATTERS MORE NOW THAN EVER. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL RUN THE GOVERNMENT AND MANAGE THE ECONOMY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T HIRE A PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS BUT TO SOLVE THEM, SET A VISION FOR A FUTURE AND THEN ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET ABOUT FULFILLING YET. IT'S TIME HAD A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES FEEDING IN ECONOMIC COMEBACK IS A FULL-TIME HANDS OF JOBS THAT RENEWS OUR COMMITMENT TO A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS THE GLASS BREAKS BUSINESS, LABOR AND GOVERNMENT TOGETHER TO RESTORE AMERICA'S COMPETITIVENESS IN A FAST-CHANGING WORLD. A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A VISION FOR A 21st CENTURY ECONOMY BASED ON SHARED PROSPERITY. WHERE WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS NOT BY THE WEALTH OF THE TOP BUT BY HOW BROADLY BOSS IS SHARED. YOU KNOW, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE FEEL I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS RICH PEOPLE WHO MADE AMERICA GREAT. I BELIEVE IS THE HARD WORKING PEOPLE OF AMERICA WHO MADE OUR COUNTRY GREAT. [APPLAUSE] WE WANT TO GET BACK TO REWARDING HARD WORK. WE WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM TO BE WITHIN EVERYONE'S REACH. WE WANT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ONE ANOTHER THAT WILL ALLOW US PARTICULARLY OUR CHILDREN TO LIVE UP TO OUR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THESE ARE NOT JUST ECONOMIC ISSUES. THESE ARE MORAL ISSUES ABOUT OUR COMMON PURPOSE AS A NATION. WHAT THE PEOPLE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES, WHETHER THEY CAN SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY, THAT SPEAKS TO WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE AND WHAT WE VALUE. THE WAY WE BRING OUR COUNTRY TO GET THERE IS BY ACTING ON OUR VALUES. TRUE YET THEY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY FINDING REAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEN DELIVERING THEM. WITHOUT REAL SOLUTIONS DIVISION AND DISAPPOINTMENT, NOT UNITY WOULD BE THE RESULT. WE'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE. PRESIDENT BUSH PROMISED TO BE A NEW FIGHTER, NOT A DIVIDER AND WE KNOW HOW WELL THAT TURNED OUT. BECAUSE UNITY COMES FROM TAKING ON THE TOUGH CHALLENGES. ASKING US TO BE BIGGER THAN OURSELVES SOME OF INVESTOR GREATNESS AGAIN. AND THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO AS PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE. I WILL BRING THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I WILL ASK ALL OF US TO BE INVOLVED IN SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS. [APPLAUSE] OTHERWISE HERE IS WHAT I FEAR. MOST OF US AS I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE CROWD IN THE FOYER AND SPELLING OUT THE DOOR, WE HAVE BEEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE SACRIFICE THAT CAME FROM PREVIOUS GENERATIONS. FROM PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS, FROM PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT THE WARS AND BUILT THE BUSINESSES AND DID THE LABOR WHO CREATED THE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS THAT AMERICA IS, WE HAVE TO KEEP FAITH WITH ALL THAT CAN BE FOR US. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT TO BE A PART OF THE FIRST GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY WORSE OFF THAN WHEN WE FOUND A. THAT WOULD BE SUCH A BREACH WITH WHAT AMERICAN HISTORY HAS MEANT TO ALL OF US. TO THE TIME FOR WAITING IS OVER AND THE TIME FOR TALK IS OVER TOO MANY FAMILIES ARE PAYING THE PRICE OF ACTION RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW. SO I THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN ACTING AND WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 20, 2009. WE NEED BOTH AN IMMEDIATE AND SHORT-TERM PLAN TO JUMP-START THE ECONOMY AND A LONG-TERM ECONOMIC VISION WITH STRATEGIES TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING WELL INTO THE FUTURE. SO LET'S START WITH THE SHORT TERM. IF I WERE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW, I WOULD WORK WITH CONGRESS TO JUMP-START THE EIGHT, B BY THE MEDIA ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS, CREATING NEW JOBS AND GETTING MONEY BACK TO THE POCKETS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE LOSS OF A HOME IS DEVASTATING AND SO MANY FAMILIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE FACING THAT. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY THOSE ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR HOMES I WORRY ABOUT. BECAUSE OF THIS MORTGAGE CRISIS, IF THE HOMEOWNER IS LOSING VALUE IN OUR HOMES. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE LOST MORE THAN $1.3 TRILLION WORTH OF VALUE IN OUR HOMES AND THE LAST YEAR. THAT'S NEARLY HALF THE SIZE OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BUDGET. AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE ESPECIALLY HARD HIT. SUBPRIME LOANS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE COMMON IN PREDOMINATELY AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS THAN PREDOMINATELY WHITE ONES. BUT THIS IS NOT JUST AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT IS TRUE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM CRISIS. YOUR HOME ISN'T JUST YOUR ONLY GREATEST SOURCE OF WEALTH. YOU'RE GREATEST SOURCE OF SECURITY. IT'S WHAT BANKERS US TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. IT'S WHERE WE RAISE OUR KIDS AND CELEBRATE BIRTHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS AND MCMURRAY TOGETHER. I'VE VISITED WITH PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND I KNOW OUR HOMES NEED TO US. I KNOW THE FEELING OF REFUGE AND SECURITY I FEEL WHEN I WALK INTO MY OWN HOME. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SIT IN HOMES WHERE FAMILIES HAVEN'T HAD THE MONEY TO BUY ALL THE FURNITURE THEY NEED BUT THEY ARE SO PROUD TO SHOW OFF THEIR NEW HOME. AND NEARLY A YEAR AGO I CALLED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS MOUNTING MORTGAGE PRICE IS LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TOLD CONGRESS THAT WHAT I WAS CALLING FOR WASN'T NECESSARY. THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CONTAINED. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER THE PRESIDENT ASSURED US THAT THERE BE A SOFT LANDING FOR THE HOUSING MARKET. BUT NOW WE KNOW BETTER. SO ALL OF LAST YEAR I PROPOSED POLICIES TO HELP FAMILIES KEEP THEIR HOMES. I WROTE TO THE REGULATORS URGING THEM TO TAKE THEIR HEAD OUT OF THE SAND AND DO SOMETHING FOR THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE. I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ABUSIVE LENDING PRACTICES AND GIVE STATES THE RESOURCES TO HELP AT RISK FAMILIES OF WITH LOSING THEIR HOMES. THE RESULT, A PLAN FOR PRESIDENT BUSH THAT LETS BANKS OFF THE HOOK AND LEAVES HOMEOWNERS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. IN THE WORD OF ONE EXPERT, THE PRESIDENT PLAN WAS THE BANK LOBBIES DREAM. THE SAID FENESTRATION HAS DELIVERED A FORECLOSURE NOTICE ON THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE PRESIDENT'S PLANS TO FIX OUR ECONOMY WOULD DO NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS. AND THEY HAVE SAID MY INSISTENCE ON STOPPING FORECLOSURE IS JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WELL, I'M SORRY TO DISAGREE. BUT THE HOUSING CRISIS IS CONTRA BIG TO RISING UNEMPLOYMENT CONSTRUCTION JOBS ARE DISAPPEARING AND I SEE A FEW HARD HATS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE. SOUTH CAROLINA ALONE HAS LOST 2,800 CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN 2007. IT'S ERASING FAMILY'S WEALTH, JEOPARDIZE IN CONSUMER SPENDING WHICH CONSTITUTES TO THIRD OF OUR ECONOMY. IT'S CAUSED $100 BILLION IN LOSSES TO BANKS MAKING THEM LESS LIKELY TO OFFER CREDIT TO BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES THAT NEEDED. THAT'S WHY MY PLAN TO FIX THE ECONOMY STARTS WITH DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INSURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE ANY MORE HOMES AND THAT WE STABILIZE THE A ECONOMY WHEN IT COMES TO THE MORTGAGE CRISIS. I WANT TO START WITH A 90 DAY MORATORIUM ON FORECLOSURES. IF THE BANK IS ABOUT TO FORECLOSE ON YOUR HOME YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME BREATHING ROOM TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR MORTGAGE. I'M CALLING FOR FREEZE IN THE MONTHLY RATE ON ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS ON TILL THE MORTGAGES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO LOANS FAMILIES CAN AFFORD. IF YOU HAVE AN ADJUSTABLE MORTGAGE THAT'S ABOUT TO SKYROCKET TWO OF THE CHANCE TO PAY OUT OF THE AFFORDABLE PAYMENTS. PEOPLE SAY, WELL ISN'T THIS REWARDING PEOPLE WHO MAY BE CAUGHT IN OVER THEIR HEAD? WELL, TO SOME EXTENT IT IS TRYING TO STOP WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT WILL AFFECT ALL OF US. IF WE DON'T HELP THESE FAMILIES WORK OUT THEIR MORTGAGES NOW WE WILL HAVE MORE OF THE HOMES BECAUSE THE HOUSING MARKET IS SO LOW RIGHT NOW NOBODY IS BUYING. THAT WILL HAVE DETERIORATED NEIGHBORHOODS. FED WILL HAVE DECREASE IN TAX REVENUES FOR CITIES AND TOWNS. IT BECOMES A VICIOUS CYCLE. THAT'S WHY ALL SO IT CREATES A $30 BILLION FUND TO HELP HARD HIT COMEDIES AND DISTRUST HOMEOWNERS WHETHER THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS. WE NEED TO BE SURE TO SHOW UP OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT THEY DON'T BEGIN TO ALSO DETERIORATES IN THE FACE OF A LOSS IN THE HOME MARKET. I ALSO WOULD INCLUDE DIRECT TAX REBATES WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. WE NEED TO TARGET THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP AND HOUSE AND SENATE ALONG WITH WHITE HOUSE APPEAR TO BE NEARING A DEAL AND I'M HEARTENED TO HEAR THAT THEY PLAN TO EXTEND ASSISTANCE TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF WORKING AMERICANS WHO NEED IT THE MOST. THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR AND THAT'S WHAT I FEEL WE HAVE TO DO. BUT I ALSO WANT TO TARGET THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES THAT ARE FACING TOUGH CHOICES. WE NEED RELIEF FROM SKYROCKETING ENERGY BILLS. WE NEED EXPANDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR THOSE STRUGGLING TO FIND A JOB. BUT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHY I WOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO SPUR GREEN, WHERE JOB GROWTH, HIGH WAGE RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED. I WOULD DO THIS -- [APPLAUSE] -- IT PRESSURIZATION PROGRAM THAT WOULD PUT PEOPLE TO WORK, HELPING TO INSULATE HOMES AND TO GIVE A GREEN COLLAR JOB TRAINING INITIATIVES TO HELP PREPARE PEOPLE. I WOULD ALSO IMPLEMENT MIKE GREEN BUILDING FUND TO REBUILD AND RENOVATE SCHOOLS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS TO HELP MAKE THEM MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT. WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS IN AMERICA THROUGH CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND I KNOW WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE. GERMANY DECIDED A FEW YEARS AGO TO MAKE A BIG BAT ON SILVER POWER. THEY CREATED TAX INCENTIVES, THEY CREATED TRAINING PROGRAMS TO TAKE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND OTHERS TO KNOW HOW TO STALL SOLAR PANELS. THE HAVE CREATED SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW JOBS IN THREE SHORT YEARS. THE HAVE A SMALLER ECONOMY THAN OURS. IF WE GOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS, I KNOW WE CAN DO THE SAME. I REALLY HOPE THAT AS PART OF THIS RECOVERY PACKAGE WE START GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT THE FUTURE. WE HAVE TO STOP THE CRISIS BUT THEN WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR AN ECONOMY THAT WILL KEEP GENERATING A GOOD NEW JOBS AND CLEAN ENERGY IS OUR BEST BET. BUT JOHN STARTING OF THE ECONOMY IS JUST THE BEGINNING. WE NEED A LONG-TERM VISION TO BUILD A STRONG PROSPEROUS ECONOMY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. I THINK IT WAS WINSTON CHURCHILL WHO SAID THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POLITICIAN AND STATESMAN IS THE POLITICIAN THINKS THE NEXT ELECTION. WHILE THE STATESMAN THINKS ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. WE CAN'T DO THIS PIECEMEAL. WE'VE GOT TO START HELPING PEOPLE MORE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, MAYBE WANT TO START SAVING FOR RETIREMENT BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOUR TAXES ARE TOO HIGH AND YOUR WAGES AREN'T HIGH ENOUGH. MAYBE WHAT TO THE BACK TO SCHOOL BUT YOUR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ARE TOO HIGH SAY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TUITION. WE LIVE IN A COMPLEX INTERCONNECTED GLOBAL ECONOMY. ALL OF OUR CHALLENGES ARE ALTOGETHER. WE CAN'T JUST PUT BAND-AIDS ON ONE AND EXPECT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS HAVE A PLAN TO CREATE GOOD JOBS AND RESTORE FAIRNESS TO THE ECONOMY. WE NEED TO REDO THE PROMISE OF AMERICA IF YOU WORK HARD YOU CAN GET AHEAD. WE NEED TO RETURN TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY SO THAT WASHINGTON ONCE AGAIN LIVES WITHIN A BUDGET JUST LIKE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAS TO DO. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE SOLVING THE JOB CRISIS OVER THE LONG RUN STARTS WITH SOLVING THE ENERGY CRISIS. THAT'S WHY I WILL CREATE A $50 BILLION STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND TO JUMP-START INVESTMENTS AND CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. WE WILL CREATE A GREAT REVOLUTION WITH INVESTMENTS AND BIOFUELS WHEN, SOLAR, GEOTHERMAL, ALL OF THE PLAN ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE. AND AS WE CREATE THIS NEW JOB, POSSIBILITIES FOR THE NEXT GENERATION, WE WILL PAY FOR IT BY ELIMINATING THE TAX SUBSIDIES FOR THE BIG OIL COMPANIES. AMD -- [APPLAUSE] -- REQUIRE THEM TO PAY INTO THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND OR INVEST AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE MADE RECORD PROFITS IN RECENT YEARS. NOW IT'S TIME THEY DID THEIR FAIR SHARE. NOW I ALSO KNOW THAT WE WON'T GET ANY OF THIS DONE UNTIL THE TWO OIL MEN BELIEVE THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT AS SOON AS THEY DO, WE WILL START TO WORK ON THIS. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL ALSO HELP TO CREATE JOBS BY MODERNIZING AND REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU KNOW, THE TRAGIC BRIDGE COLLAPSE IN MINNESOTA THIS PAST SUMMER, A RECENT BREAK IN NEVADA AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE LEVEES IN NEW ORLEANS ARE PAINFUL REMINDERS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS A DANGEROUS DISREPAIR. EVERY BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND FIXING CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE CREATES 48,000 NEW JOBS. I HAVE A REBUILD AMERICA PLAN TO INVEST $10 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS IN AN EMERGENCY REPAIR FUND. NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR PORTS, AIRPORTS, PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEMS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS, ROADS, WE NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO BROADBAND ACROSS AMERICA PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS AND WE NEED TO END THIS ADMINISTRATION ON SCIENCE AND RESTORE AMERICA TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE. [APPLAUSE] AS THE INNOVATION NATION I WILL INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND UNIVERSITIES WE BECAME SO SUCCESSFUL AFTER WORLD WAR II BECAUSE BUSINESS AND SCIENCE WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH GOVERNMENT. OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES LIKE FURMAN WERE ON THE CUTTING EDGE WE TRANSLATED INTO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE. CREATING JOBS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. WE NEED TO EMPOWER OUR WORKERS AND MAKE SURE OUR TAX SYSTEM IS FAIR AND THAT'S THE SECOND PIECE OF A LONG-TERM PLAN. FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS THE OIL COMPANIES, PREDATORY STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, DRUG COMPANIES HAVE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP FOR THEM. I INTEND TO BE PRESIDENT STANDS UP FOR YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT HOW WE MAKE AMERICA WORK BETTER FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] DURING THE 1950'S AND 60'S WHICH MANY OF US LOOK BACK AT WITH GREAT APPRECIATION BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WORKED SO WELL FOR SO LONG FOR SO MANY WE HAD A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR WORK FORCE UNIONIZED NOW IT IS MUCH LOWER. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN FOR GOOD WAGES AND SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. WE NEED TO -- [APPLAUSE] -- WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE RESTORE FAIRNESS TO THE ECONOMY BY RESTORING FAIRNESS TO THE TAX CODE. RIGHT NOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT IN A NEW YORK SAID, WALL STREET INVESTMENT MANAGERS MAKING $50 MILLION A YEAR PAID JUST 15% ON THEIR EARNINGS WHILE A TEACHER MAKING $50,000 A YEAR PAYS 25%. I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I'VE BEEN CALLING TO RAISE THE TAXES ON THOSE AT THE TIME. [APPLAUSE] AS CORPORATE PROFITS HAVE SKYROCKETED THE PERCENTAGE OF TAXES PAID BY CORPORATIONS HAS FALLEN. WE HAVE RICHLY REWARD PEOPLE AND I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO DO WELL. THAT IS PART OF AMERICA STANDS FOR. BUT IT IS THAT RIGHT THE WEALTHY AND THE WELL-CONNECTED OF GOTTEN SO MANY MORE BENEFITS THAN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING PEOPLE. WE NEED TO EXTEND MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS INCLUDING A CHILD TAX CREDIT, MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF, WE NEED TO REFORM THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T HIT MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WITH HIGHER TAX RATES. IT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO LOVE. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE TAX CREDIT AND RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO MAKE SURE WORK PAYS FOR ALL AMERICANS. NO ONE WHO WORKS FULL TIME SHOULD LIVE IN POVERTY. IF YOU'RE WORKING FULL TIME YOU SHOULDN'T LIVE IN POVERTY. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN TODAY'S COMPLEX ECONOMY. THAT STARTS WITH THE COMMITTING OURSELVES TO MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THE AVERAGE STUDENT DEBT UPON GRADUATION IS $20,000. SO YOU START IN A BIG HOLE BEFORE YOU EVER GOT INTO WORK ON THE FIRST DAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED WHICH IS REALLY TROUBLING TO ME IS AMERICA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. WE HAD AN OPEN SYSTEM, THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO GET DEGREES BUT NOW FROM JAPAN, TO SOUTH KOREA, CANADA AND IRELAND, OTHER COUNTRIES ARE EDUCATING THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AT A HIGHER RATE THAN HERE IN AMERICA AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE COST HAS EXPLODED. IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TODAY THAN I WAS THERE D YEARS AGO TO SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE. THAT'S WHY I'VE OUTLINED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO OPEN THE DOORS OF COLLEGE TO YOUNG PEOPLE IT INCLUDES A NEW $3,500 TAX CREDIT THAT WILL COVER MORE OF AN 50% OF THE TYPICAL COST TO PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND THE FULL COST OF TUITION AND FEES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I ALSO WANT TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF PELL GRANTS SOMETHING FORMER SECRETARY RILEY MENTIONED MUCH STRENGTHENED COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND INVEST $500 MILLION TO SUPPORT INNOVATED OF THE JOB TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIPS PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE. WE ALSO HAVE TO INSURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA ALONE 600 -- [APPLAUSE] -- 672,000 PEOPLE ARE UNINSURED. I WANT TO ASK YOU HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHO IS UNINSURED? AND HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY MAY HAVE INSURANCE BUT IT JUST DOESN'T PAY FOR WHAT THE DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL SAYS YOU NEED? WELL YOU SEE WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS. IF THE PROBLEM OF THE UNINSURED AND THE PROBLEM OF THE UNDERINSURED. AND MY AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICE PLAN WOULD INSURE EVERY SINGLE PERSON FOR WHAT THEY NEED. IT'S SIMPLE. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU LIKE YOU KEEP IT. THERE'S NO DISRUPTION THREE GIVE A GOOD POLICY THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS OR A UNION OR A MUNICIPALITY, NOTHING CHANGES. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE OR YOU DON'T LIKE THE ENTRANCE TO HAVE YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM THE SAME MENU OF PRIVATE PLANS AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND WE WILL PROVIDE TAX CREDITS TO HELP AFFORDED. [APPLAUSE] MY PLAN ALSO BANS INSURANCE COMPANY DISCRIMINATION SO YOU NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OR RISK FACTORS. [APPLAUSE] AND WE DON'T REQUIRE SMALL BUSINESS TO DO ANYTHING BUT IT DOES PROVIDE TAX CREDITS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES IF THEY CHOOSE TO AFFORD TO BUY HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND FINALLY, WE HAVE TO HELP MORE AMERICANS SAVE FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT. RIGHT NOW, FEWER THAN HALF OF ALL AMERICANS HAVE ANY RETIREMENT SAVINGS AT ALL NINE PRESIDENT OF ONE TO PROVIDE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WITH AN EASY AUTOMATIC OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE FOR AMERICAN RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. THESE ACCOUNTS WILL PICK THE BEST OF THE 41K PLANS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO EVERY WORKING FAMILY AND WILL GIVE FAMILIES OF TO $1,000 IN TAX CUTS TO HELP THEM SAVE. AND FINALLY WE'VE GOT TO RETURN TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. YEAR AFTER YEAR THE PRESIDENT HAS INCREASED SPENDING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. AND HANDED TAX CUT AFTER TAX CUT TO MULTI MILLIONAIRES, OIL COMPANIES AND OTHER INTEREST GROUPS AND HOW HAS HE PAID FOR ALL OF THIS SPENDING? BY BORROWING MONEY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA. WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHY IS IT HARD TO GET TOUGH ON CHINA AND ENFORCE OUR TRADE AGREEMENTS? WELL I TELL THEM BECAUSE THERE ARE BANKERS. WE OWE THEM. HOW CAN WE TRULY ENFORCE THE TRADE LAWS AGAINST A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA WHEN OUR ECONOMY DEPENDS ON CHINA'S MASSIVE LOANS TO US? THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY. WE WANT OUR MONEY FROM CHINA TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. THAT IS A DEBT IN STRATEGY FOR AMERICA. AND THAT GOING TO END THAT STRATEGY IF I HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BECOMING PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE I WANT AMERICA TO REGAIN CONTROL ITS DESTINY BY MOVING BACK TOWARD A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. THAT'S WHY FORKED THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN TO SHOW EXACTLY HOW I WOULD PAY FOR EVERY INITIATIVE I HAVE JUST MENTIONED. IT'S NOT HOW I WILL RUN MY CAMPAIGN BUT I WILL RUN OUR COUNTRY AS WELL. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND EVEN SOME HERE AT HOME ARE BASICALLY SAY THE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE KIND OF ECONOMY WE HAVE BEFORE. THE ACT AS THOUGH THE 1990'S WAS ANCIENT ROME. IT WORKED WELL IN THE 1990'S. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAD A $7,000 GAINED IN IN COME IN THE 1990'S. [APPLAUSE] NOW, EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE LESSONS WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THE PAST. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK. WE ARE UNDERMINING OUR SECURITY AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE UNDERMINING THE AMERICAN DREAM HERE AT HOME. GREAT PRESIDENTS HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THE GREATNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FACED WITH A DEPRESSION, GRAVE THREATS TO AMERICA'S FREEDOM, HE RESPONDED WITH BOTH SOLUTIONS. YES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL BUT WE ROSE FROM ECONOMIC CHAOS AND DESPAIR AND AT THE TIME HE DIED WE ARE MONTHS AWAY FROM WINNING A WORLD WAR. HE DIDN'T PAINT A ROSY SCENARIO. HE DIDN'T IGNORE THE CHALLENGES. HE URGED TO CONFRONT THEM. WE HAD A GREAT MANY PROBLEMS AHEAD OF US AND WE MUST APPROACH THEM WITH REALISM AND COURAGE. HE BELIEVE WE CAN TACKLE OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES AND I BELIEVE EXACTLY THE SAME. WE HAVE TO OVERCOME THE FEAR AND FATALISM THE PRESIDENT BUSH HAS USED TO DIVIDE US AND SET US AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I SOMETIMES HEAR THE PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT I DON'T HEAR AMERICA TALKING. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS WITHOUT WRECKING OUR ECONOMY. WE CAN'T PROVIDE AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTH CARE WITHOUT WRECKING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE CAN'T HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT CREATES A RISING STANDARD OF LIVING FOR EVERYBODY WILLING TO WORK HARD. SINCE WHEN THAT AMERICA BECOME THE CAN'T DO COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE KNOW AND LOVE. WE'RE GOING TO FACE THE FUTURE WITHOUT OPTIMISM, WITH OUR FAITH, OUR BELIEF THAT WE CAN OVERCOME ANY CHALLENGE. I AM OPTIMISTIC. I KNOW WE ARE FACING SOME TOUGH, TOUGH ISSUES. I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY. AND ASKING THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME JUST LIKE I ASK THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TO TAKE A CHANCE ON THE IN 2000. I SAID IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT 42. YOU WILL HAVE SOMEONE WHO GETS UP EVERY DAY THINKING ABOUT YOU. I'M NOT A SHOW HORSE. ON A WORKHORSE AND I WILL GO TO WORK FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT ALONE. I CAN'T DO IT ALONE. WE ALL HAVE TO BE IN THIS TOGETHER. WHEN I TALK ABOUT A CLEAN, GREEN, RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE ON GOING TO ASK ALL OF YOU TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS WHEN YOU KEEP THE LIGHTS ON, WHEN YOU DRIVE MORE THAN MAYBE YOU NEED TO ON A DAY MAKING THREE TRIPS TO THE MALL INSTEAD OF ONE SENSIBLE ONE. [LAUGHTER] I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT EVERY TIME WE FELT THE GAS TANK OR LEAVE THOSE LIGHTS ON, YOU'RE SENDING MONEY TO OIL COMPANIES AND OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES THAT DON'T ALWAYS HAVE OUR BEST INTEREST AT HEART. WHAT I SAY WE NEED A NEW APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE THAT PROVIDES QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN AND GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOUR HOUSE AND HALF OF YOUR CHILDREN BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE THE BEST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE HEALTHIER. WE NEED A SYSTEM OF WELLNESS, NOT ONE THAT INTERVENES WITH SICKNESS. WE GOT TO ONCE AGAIN BE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS TO GATHER. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WE ARE THE OLDEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD FOR A REASON. BECAUSE WHENEVER TIMES ARE TOUGH, WHENEVER THE CHALLENGES ARE BIG AND THE STAKES ARE HUGE, WE ALL RESPOND. WINSTON CHURCHILL ALWAYS SAID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FINALLY GET AROUND TO DOING THE RIGHT THING AFTER TRADING NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE. [LAUGHTER] WELL, WE TRIED NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AND I THINK WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSONS. SO NOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FACE THE FUTURE, REALISTICALLY, COURAGEOUSLY, CONFIDENTLY, AND OPTIMISTICALLY. I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER. I NEED YOUR HELP IN THE PRIMARY ON SATURDAY. I NEED YOU TO VOTE, NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FOR YOURSELVES, YOUR FAMILIES, AND YOUR FUTURE. I AM READY TO LEAVE ON DAY ONE, AND IF YOU GIVE ME THAT OPPORTUNITY, WE WILL RESTORE PRIDE AND PROGRESS IN OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL, EVERY, EVERY TOUCH. [APPLAUSE] .. [INAUDIBLE] >> THANK YOU. YES. [APPLAUSE] [INAUDIBLE] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. YES SIR. >> I AM VERY LUCKY THAT SHE HAS A GOOD JOB WITH INSURANCE, BUT SHE IS ONLY A CONVERSATION AWAY FROM BEING UNEMPLOYED. WHAT CAN YOU DO THE FIRST DAY YOU ARE ELECTED PRESIDENT BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ELECTED PRESIDENT, I AM SURE OF THAT, BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO TO INSURE THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH THE CONGRESS AND PROMISED ME THAT HE WILL HAVE A UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE THAT IS AFFORDABLE YOUR FIRST TERM. >> THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO AND LET ME SAY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO DO IMMEDIATELY. ONE OF THEM IS TO ASK THE CONGRESS TO SEND ME THE BILLS THAT PRESIDENT BUSH VETOED. ONE OF THOSE IS AN EXTENSION OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT I HELPED TO START TENURES AGO. 68,000 CHILDREN IN SOUTH CAROLINA RIGHT NOW GIVE HEALTHCARE FROM THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND IT AND I WILL SIGN THE BILL BECAUSE WE NEED TO HELP MORE WORKING FAMILIES AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FREE CARE, THEY ARE LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER WHO WORKS AND SUPPORTS YOUR CHILD, SO WE NEED TO GET MORE BACKUP CARE. WE WILL DO THAT IMMEDIATELY, THEN WE WILL START TO WORK ON THE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE PLAN AND THE REASON I DESIGNED A PLAN THE WAY I HAVE IS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THE MOST REALISTIC CHANCE FOR PASSING IT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THE FOLKS ON THE OTHER SIDE WILL SAY. IF YOU KNOW THEY SAY, UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, THAT THIS GOVERNMENT MEDICINE, THAT IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE SO I'M IN A POSITION NOT TO SAY ALL I WANT TO DO IS TO GIVE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE FOR THEMSELVES. SUS YOUR CONGRESSMAN, THE SEA OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE? I DON'T THINK SO. IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONGRESS, IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A STRONG CHANCE TO GET IT PASSED. [APPLAUSE] YES SIR. >> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT OUR BORDERS? >> WE ARE GOING TO TOUGHEN BORDER SECURITY, WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THE WE HAVE STRONG BORDER CONTROLS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLY A QUESTION ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, IT IS A QUESTION ABOUT OUR SECURITY. WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO IS COMING IN AND OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. ONE THING PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN RECOGNIZED IS THAT, OF ALL OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WE HAVE IN AMERICA, 40% OF THEM CAME HERE ILLEGALLY AND OVERSTAYED THEIR LEGAL AUTHORIZATION. WE CONCENTRATE ON THOSE WHO CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY, THE 40%, INCLUDING UNFORTUNATELY THE PEOPLE WHO HIJACKED THOSE PLANES AND FLEW THEM INTO BUILDINGS IN THE CITY I REPRESENT, AS WELL AS THE PENTAGON, SO WE HAVE GOT TO LOOK -- WE HAVE THAT TO HAVE BORDER CONTROLS INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION AND PASSPORT AND VISA CONTROLS, OTHERWISE WE WILL NEVER GET A HANDLE ON IT SO WE HAVE GOT TO DO THAT. YES SIR. >> IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [CHEERING] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. I WROTE A BOOK CALLED IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD AND THAT A CHAPTER CALLED EVERY CHILD NEEDS THE CHAMPION AND MOST OF US ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS OR AUNTS OR UNCLES OR SOMEONE WHO WAS OUR CHAMPION BUT I THINK IT IS TIME WE HAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE A CHAMPION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE, AND THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT YOU SAY THAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE THE HARDEST CHOICES AND DECISIONS, YOU KNOW I OBVIOUSLY I HAVE SAID MANY, MANY TIMES THAT I REGRET THE WAY PRESIDENT BUSH USED THE AUTHORITY HE WAS GIVEN ON THE IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION. BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY AND I SAID AT THE TIME THAT MY VOTE WAS NOT VOTE FOR A PREEMPTIVE WAR, AND IF HE HAD LET THE INSPECTORS COMPLETE THEIR JOB AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS THERE AND WHAT WAS NOT THERE THINK IT WAS HIGHLY LIKELY WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED GOING TO WAR. SO I LOOK BACK ON THAT AND OBVIOUSLY IF I HAD KNOWN THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW ABOUT WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO I WOULD'VE NEVER VOTED IT INTO THE AUTHORITY. [APPLAUSE] YES, RIGHT THERE. >> I HOPE I CAN VOTE TWICE FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> I JUST WANTED THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT GREEN JOBS. AS A YOUNG PERSON IS IT EXCITING FOR US TO LOOK FORWARD TO NOT ONLY CLEAN ECONOMY IN CLEANING UP POLLUTION BUT SOLVING POVERTY AT THE SAME TIME. BUT ONE THING I THINK ABOUT THAT IS THAT OBVIOUSLY BIG OIL AND BICKLE ARE NOT GOING TO ROLL OVER EASY, IN FACT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO LOVE YOU IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY ARE LOVING YOU RIGHT NOW. IS STANDING OUTSIDE THOSE DOORS ARE REPRESENTED THIS FROM THE COLD COMPANIES, SAYING WE CAN GET AWAY WITH DOING CALL, WE CAN KEEP GOING TO CLEAN COAL, SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, WE'LL BE WILLING TO STAND UP TO THAT NOW? CAN NEWT PLEDGE WE WON'T JUST ACCORD GREEN ENERGY BET WE WILL STOP -- AND WE WON'T BUILD ANY MORE COAL-FIRED PLANTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND RUN THE COUNTRY? >> HERE IS WHAT I'VE SAID MY ENERGY PLAN BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VISIONARY AND REALISTIC AT THE SAME TIME. AND I HAVE SAID THAT I DO NOT WANT NEW COAL-FIRED PLANTS TO BE BUILT UNLESS NUMBER ONE, THEY ARE BUILT WITH THE CLEANEST POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGY AND THEY COMMIT TO THAT. I WANT TO CLEAN UP ALL THE EXISTING COAL-FIRED PLANTS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE BASICALLY AVOIDED EVEN THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW SOURCE REVIEW, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. I ALSO WANT TO DO SOME DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ON CARBON, STORAGE AND SEQUESTRATION. THAT MEANS TRYING TO STRIP THE CARVIN OUT OF THE COAL, AND I THINK IT IS WORTH EXPERIMENTING WITH THAT. SOME PEOPLE HAVE CALLED FOR A MORATORIUM ON ALL COAL-FIRED PLANTS. I THINK IN EFFECT WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED, WHICH IS THAT THEY CANNOT BE BUILT IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE CHANGES WILL CERTAINLY SLOW IT DOWN AND GIVE US THE CHANCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR ALTERNATIVES WORK. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, WE HAVE TO PROVE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE NEVER DONE THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE SUBSIDIZED COAL AND OIL AND NUCLEAR POWER AND GAS, SO WE HAVE NEVER REALLY GIVEN ALTERNATIVES A CHANCE, AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO THAT BECAUSE I AM CONVINCED THAT WE CAN SOLVE MUCH OF OUR ENERGY CRISIS AND OUR GLOBAL WARMING CRISIS WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY. I AM ALSO CONVINCED THAT IF WE MOVE TOWARD HIGHER GAS MILEAGE IN OUR CARS, WHICH WERE SLOWLY BEGINNING TO DO, WE CAN MAKE THE HUGE DIFFERENCE. I JUST SAW A CAR THAT WAS BEING TESTED AND IN WASHINGTON FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. IT IS AN ELECTRIC PLUG-IN, IT HAS A NEW LONG-LASTING BATTERY, AND IT DROVE 1500 MILES ON 10 GALLONS OF GAS. AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO START PRODUCING DOES CARS BY 2010 IF WE REALLY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT IT. SO WHY FINKEL HAS TO BE PUT UNDER INCREDIBLE DISCIPLINE IF WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE IT AT ALL, BUT I THINK REALISTICALLY WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE RIGHT NOW SO WE HAVE THAT TO TRY TO MAKE THE TRANSITION, PUT IN TOUGHER CONTROLS, AND DO THE EXPERIMENT ON SEQUESTRATION IN STORAGE AND THEN TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN TAKE STOCK ABOUT WHERE WE STAND. BUT WE MUST SUBSIDIZE SOLAR, WIND, GEOTHERMAL, BIOFUELS. WE HAVE SUBSIDIZED EVERYTHING ELSE. WE HAVE GOT TO SUBSIDIZE IT TO CREATE A MARKET SO IT CAN BE COMPETITIVE WITH COAL, OIL AND THAT IS HOW YOU GET TO A MARKET THAT WILL WORK. GUESS MIM. YES MAAM. [INAUDIBLE] YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] >> YES MAAM. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT IS A VIGOROUS AGENDA AND I HAVE TO SAY, I WITH -- AGREE WITH THAT. WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE DOUGHNUT HOLE IN MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION PART D. I'VE NEVER SEEN AN INSURANCE POLICY WHERE YOU PAY YOUR PREMIUMS IN WHEN NEEDED TO A CERTAIN LEVEL THEY QUIT PAYING AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY OUT OF POCKET PLUS CONTINUE TO PAY THE PREMIUMS. IT IS NOT A DOUGHNUT HOLE, IT IS A BLACK HOLE. YOU FALLEN TO A INACTIVE FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF ITS THAT WE NEED TO GIVE MEDICARE THE RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE FOR THE OR PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES AND I HAVE TO SAY, IF MY FRIEND HERSHEL GOLDBERG, A VIETNAM VET, U.S. SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. WHEN HE WAS THERE DURING MY HUSBAND'S ADMINISTRATION THAT THE DAY THAT THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN WITH DRUG COMPANIES TO GET THE COST OF DRUGS DONE FOR VETERANS. THAT IS THE KIND OF SMART POLICY WE NEED TO HAVE IN MEDICARE AND THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO BECAUSE THE PRICES HAVE GOT TO GET DONE, THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE WAY OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT THEY ARE CHARGING AMERICANS. YES MAAM. [APPLAUSE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] >> THIS IS A SPECIFIC PROBLEM. IF YOU ADOPT A CHILD FROM OVERSEAS, LOTS OF TIMES THE CHILD HAS MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC NEEDS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUALIFY FOR THE SERVICES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE UNDER MEDICAID, AND WE DID CHANGE THE LAW WHEN BILL WAS THEN BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS WRONG IF YOU ARE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND YOU ADOPTED CHILD, THAT SHOWED SHOULD BECOME PART OF THE CITIZENSHIP FAMILY IN A SENSE AND WE NEED TO HELP AND I'M GLAD WE ARE BORN TO DO THAT. WE HAVE TO, MY HEALTHCARE PLAN DOES NOT COVER IT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCY HEALTHCARE, WHICH I THINK IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S INTEREST FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. AND PART OF THE CHALLENGES, HOW WE GET ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS INTO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I WANT EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN OF AMERICAN CITIZENS SHOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE, AND THEY WILL BE. THANK YOU. GUESS MAAM. THAT'S OKAY. [INAUDIBLE] >> THE LATINO COMMUNITY, I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LATINO COMMUNITY FOR MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, A LONG TIME AGO, I DID NOT WANT TO WORK FOR LAW FIRM. I WANTED TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND WHICH WAS STARTED BY A NATIVE OF SOUTH CAROLINA FROM BENNETTSVILLE, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN NAMED MARION WRIGHT EDELMAN. I ADMIRED HER WEAR IT AND I ADMIRED HER AND WENT TO WORK FOR HER A AND I WORKED WITH HER OFF AND ON FOR MANY YEARS. DURING THE COURSE OF MY WORK ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND IN MANY OF THE OTHER POSITIONS AND JOBS I'VE HAD, I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH PRACTICALLY EVERY COMMUNITY IN AMERICA. OBVIOUSLY I HAVE DEEP ROOTS AND VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIPS IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE LATINO COMMUNITY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SEE OURSELVES AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THAT WE ARE ALL PART OF THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WENT UP LAST WEEK, WELL IT WENT UP MUCH MORE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO COMMUNITIES. OFTEN SPACE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT LATINOS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND OTHERS AND I APPLAUD DO THAT. THAT IS WHAT I'VE DONE MY ENTIRE PUBLIC SERVICE AND IN PUBLIC OFFICE. THANK YOU. I SAW A HAND UP SIDE, YES, RIGHT THERE. [INAUDIBLE] SFIUS MAAM, THE GREAT QUESTION ALWAYS BEEN ALL THIS MONEY ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND. AND LYNNVILLE LEFT OFFICE, AND WE HAD THAT BALANCED BUDGET IN A SURPLUS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR IT WAS TO MAKE SURE, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER HIM TALKING ABOUT PUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY IN A LOCKED BOX. IN OTHER WORDS GET AWAY FROM THE POLITICIANS IN QUOTED IN A SAFE PLACE SO IT CAN BE USED TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE THE WAR IN IRAQ. LET'S MAKE IT OFF LIMITS AND KEEP IT SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING BUDGET OF THE COUNTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH CAME IN, HE HAD TO BID PRIORITIES. HIS TWO PRIORITIES FOR TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS AND THE WAR IN IRAQ. NEITHER OF WHICH YOU WOULD PAY FOR, SO SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND WHICH WE HAVE A PLAN TO KEEP TOTALLY SOLVENT UNTIL 2055 IS NOW DOWN TO 2041 AND STARTING AT 2018 IT WILL BE PUTTING OUT, IT WILL BE TAKING IN LESS THAN A FOOT OUT BUT IT WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY BENEFITS UNTIL 2041 SO WE HAVE TO FACE THE LONG TERM CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL SECURITY. HERE IS WHAT I WOULD DO. NUMBER ONE WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLENISH THE TRUST FUND. IT IS WRONG TO BAR FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND FOR THE KIND OF SPENDING THE PRESIDENT BUSH HAS DONE OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. SECONDLY, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ABOUT HOW TO FIX SOCIAL SECURITY. IT IS NOT IN CRISIS, MEDICARE IS IN CRISIS, SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT AND WE NEED TO FIX IT BEFORE IT IS. WHAT I'VE SAID IS I WOULD APPOINT A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION AND I WOULD SAY THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU CAN'T DO, YOU CANNOT FIX THE LONG TERM CHALLENGES AND SOCIAL SECURITY BY RAISING TAXES ON MIDDLE-CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES AND YOU CAN'T CUT BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON SOCIAL SECURITY. THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS WE CAN FIX IT WITH GOING IN EITHER THE DIRECTION SO I INTEND TO IMMEDIATELY CONVENE THAT BIPARTISAN COMMISSION AND WE WILL BEGAN WORKING FOR HOW WE ARE GOING TO RESOLVE SOCIAL SECURITY. BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE RETIREMENT SAVINGS ON TOP OF SOCIAL SECURITY. I THOUGHT ONE OF THE REALLY BAD IDEA OF THE REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD IS PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY. I AM 100% AGAINST THE. IF YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY HAD BEEN IN THE STOCK MARKET OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE ALL HAD HEART ATTACKS. I SURE WOULD HAVE. SO I DON'T THINK PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY SHOULD EVER BE CONSIDERED. WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS THAT WE NEED TO, IS THIS THAT MY REMARKS, GIVE PEOPLE INCENTIVES TO SAVE BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WAGES HAVE BEEN PRETTY STAGNANT, SO WHAT IF PEOPLE DONE? THERE REFINANCE THEIR HOUSES AND BARRED MONEY, MAX THAT THEIR CREDIT CARDS, GONE INTO DEBT TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND SO WE HAVE NO SAVINGS AS A COUNTRY. SO WE HAVE GOT TO START HELPING PEOPLE TO SAY. YOU CAN'T POINT FINGERS AND SAY THE SAVE AND SOMEBODY SAYS, LOOK GET MY BUDGET, HAVE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE OR THE RENT, PAY TO GET TO WORK, I'VE GOT TO PAY MY HEALTHCARE INSURANCE, SO WE HAVE TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO HOKIES SAVE. THAT HAS TO BE ON TOP OF SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL PROVIDE HELP SO WE CAN SAVE, THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO HAVE A MORE SECURE RETIREMENT. [APPLAUSE] WAY BACK THERE, THE GENTLEMAN. >> I AGREE WITH MANY THINGS YOU HAVE SAID, BUT I AM CONCERNED, SAYING ONE THING BUT GETTING IT TO COME TO FRUITION IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FEEL SO HOW WOULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT WORKING WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? >> WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID I WOULD NEVER WORK FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND THE REPUBLICANS WOULD NEVER WORK WITH ME BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW ME. IN FACT A LOT OF WHAT YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ME AND WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW IS THAT LEAVE PUBLIC SERVICE, PUBLIC OFFICE IS A TRUST AND I WENT TO WORK IMMEDIATELY, WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE, SEEKING TO FIND COMMON GROUND. I HAVE WORKED WITH YOUR SENATOR LINDSAY GRAHAM. DNI BULLSEYE PROBLEM AT THE SAME TIME. I SOUGHT IN NEW YORK, HE SOUGHT IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHERE THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE FOR BEING CALLED UP AFTER 9/11 AND BEGINNING TO BE SENT TO IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN. MANY OF THEM DID NOT HAVE HEALTHCARE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT IN THEIR CIVILIAN JOBS, THE ONLY HAD ACCESS TO A MEDICAL DOCTOR WHEN THEY WERE ON DUTY. ONE WEEKEND A MONTH, TWO WEEKS IN THE SUMMER OR WHEN THEY WERE DEPLOYED. SO, I JOINED FORCES AND I BET A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PREDICTED I WOULD NEVER WORK WITH SENATOR GRAHAM AND HE WOULD NEVER WORKED WITH ME THAT THAT IS NOT HOW YOU GET THINGS DONE WHEN YOU ARE IN GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE GOT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE. I WENT ACROSS PARTY LINES AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY MORE THAN 9,000 NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS AND SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF WHAT SENATOR GRAHAM AND I DID AND WE DID OVER THE THREAT OF A VETO FROM PRESIDENT BUSH, BUT WE GOT IT DONE BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE WORKED WITH MANY REPUBLICANS ON MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES FROM OUR 911 EMERGENCY SYSTEM ACROSS OUR COUNTRY TO GIVING A RESPITE CARE TO CARE GIVERS WHO ARE CARING FOREHAND ELECTOR METCOM, TO MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO REQUIRE DRUG COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY TEST THE DRUGS THAT THEY GIVE TO OUR KIDS AND SO MUCH ELSE, BECAUSE YOU SEE A I THINK IF YOU CAN'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING, WE KNOW THAT. THEIR DIFFERENCES IN PHILOSOPHIES, DIFFERENCES IN APPROACHES BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT MAKES MORE THAN 50% NEVER TO WORK WITH THE OTHER PARTY, YOU CAN GET THINGS DONE TOGETHER. I, HAS BEEN THE THAT. WHEN THE REPUBLICANS TOOK OVER THE CONGRESS UNDER THAN SPEAKER GINGRICH, THEY HAD A ROCKY BEGINNING. THE SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN AND BILL HAD TO STAND HIS GROUND AGAINST THAT. YOU HAVE TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND YET TO BE ABLE TO STAND YOUR GROUND BUT THEN THEY WORK TO GET THE RIGHT KIND OF WELFARE REFORM, TO GET A BALANCED BUDGET IN SURPLUS, TO MAKE US FEEL LIKE WE COULD INTERVENE EFFECTIVELY IN A PLACE LIKE KOSOVO SO THERE WAS A LOT THAT WE DID TOGETHER. I WILL TAKE THAT SAME APPROACH AND I THINK I'VE PROVEN THAT IN THE SENATE. OF AND IN NEW YORK WHEN I FIRST RAN, PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK OF NEW YORK AS NEW YORK CITY AND IT IS THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION OF WE HAVE LOT OF, TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP, WE HAVE A LOT OF TERRITORY ABOVE NEW YORK CITY GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE CANADIAN BORDER. WE HAVE A LOT OF FARMS, 34,000 FAMILY FARMS COMMENTARY, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT IF YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE THEY GET TO KNOW YOU, YOU GET TO KNOW THEM, AND SO WHEN IRAN FOR REELECTION I CARRIED ALL BUT FOUR OF OUR 62 COUNTIES, 36 OF WHICH HAVE BEEN CARRIED BY PRESIDENT BORIS SO I GOT A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTES, A LOT OF INDEPENDENT VOTES AND THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO WIN THIS RACE. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] NO COAT.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?203711-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON WAS AT A RALLY IN GREATER ST. LOUIS. SHE WAS INTRODUCED BY BILL CLINTON. THIS IS ABOUT 345 MINUTES. >> HELLO MISSOURI. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] >> MR. MY OR, THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. THANK YOU FOR WAITING. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAD A LITTLE ELECTION IN NEVADA TODAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> FOUR YEARS AGO, ONLY 9,000 PEOPLE VOTED IN NEVADA'S CAUCUS, TODAY OVER 115,000 PEOPLE VOTED. AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT OF ALL THE BALLOTS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT WELL OVER HALF OF IT VOTED FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU FOLLOWED IT, IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE, A GREAT MOVIE. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS 11 DAYS AGO, THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE DANCING ON HILLARY'S GRAVE, AND THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER THING COMING NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO SAY JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS IN INTRODUCING HER, AND THEN I WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM HER. BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, I THINK, THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WHAT HAPPENED IN NEVADA, BECAUSE IT WILL PLAY OUT NOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SHE THE EXACTLY TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT TO MOVE 16 POINTS, AND IT ALL BEGAN WHEN A TELEVISION INTERVIEWER IN THE DEBATE SAID, ""TELL ME SOMETHING YOU HAVE DONE IN YOUR PUBLIC LIFE FOR OTHER PEOPLE."" ONE CANDIDATE MENTIONED A PATIENT'S BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH PASSED THE SENATE AND WE SUPPORTED IT, BUT IT DIDN'T PIECE THE HOUSE. ANOTHER MENTIONED THE LOBBYING BILL WHICH PREVENTS LOBBYIST FROM BUYING LUNCH FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. AND HILLARY SAID I HELPED GET THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM PASSED. 6 MILLION KIDS GOT HEALTH INSURANCE. AND I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE TO SAY WHEN MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE, SERVE OUR COUNTRY, WHEN THEY COME HOME, THEY GET THE SAME HEALTH CARE THAT REGULAR PERSONNEL DO. YOU COULD FEEL THE GROUND MOVE, BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED THEY WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS MADE POSITIVE CHANGES IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. THEN IN NEVADA, THE SAME THING HAPPENED, WE WERE BEING TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD WIN, ALL THE ORGANIZED FORCES WERE AGAINST HER, AND THEY ASKED HER ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY, AND ONE SID, WELL, THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT IS A SENSE OF VISION, AND THEN FIND PEOPLE TO RUN THE BUREAUCRACY. THEN SHE SAID, ""OH, THERE'S SOMETHING IN BETWEEN. IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS CALLED THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES, IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT POSITIVE CHANGES ARE MADE IN OTHER PEOPLES LIVES, WHETHER IT IS MORE JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES OR AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE OR AFFORDABLE COLLEGE OR A FUTURE WHERE OUR KIDS DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TERRORISM OR GLOBAL WARMING, IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S JOB TO CREATE A NEW BEGINNING FOR AMERICA. AND YOU COULD FEEL THE GROUND MOVE, ONCE AGAIN. I HAVE SAID THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND I AM GOING BRING HER ON WITH JUST ONE SIMPLE STATEMENT. IF I HAD KNOWN HILLARY AS I HAVE, SINCE 1971, KNOWING WHAT I KNOW ABOUT PRESIDENCY, AND THE ENORMOUS ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGES THIS COUNTRY FACES TODAY. IF WE HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED AND SHE ASKED ME TO BE TONIGHT HERE WITH HER. I WOULD BE HERE IN A HEART BEAT. SHE IS THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SUPPORT AND I HOME YOU WILL SUPPORT HER ON FEBRUARY THE 5th. >> THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. OH, MY GOODNESS. THANK YOU. WELL, I AM THRILLED TO SEE YOU ALL, PLEASE EVERYONE SIT DOWN, THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE HAD CHAIRS, YOU HAVE BEEN SO PATIENT. IT'S TAKEN A LITTLE LONGER TO GET HERE THAN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD, BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE SURE TO STAY AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THANK ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE IN NEVADA WHO HAD HELPED ME. I TOLD THEM I REALLY APPRECIATED WHAT THEY DID, BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID SHOWED EXACTLY HOW THE WEST WAS WON AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT TOGETHER EARLIER TODAY. BUT NOW WE ARE BACK HERE IN THE MIDWEST WHERE I'M FROM, AND I AM SO HOOP TO CITY ALL OF YOU. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO THANK MAYOR LOWERY, THANK YOU HAD MAYOR FOR BEING WITH ME. I WANT TO THANK JEFF SPIEGEL THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE. AND I WANT TO THANK DR. SHANE HOPPER WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> AND, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT ANOTHER WOMAN WHO TOOK ON A BIG JOB, WHO WE LOST LAST NIGHT, GEORGIA FRONTAIRE. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF SPORTS FANS IN THIS TOWN, I KNOW THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> AND SHE LOVED, LOVED NOT ONLY THE CITY, BUT LOVED THE TEAM AND I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT I KNOW SHE'LL BE MISSED. YOU KNOW, EACH OF US IN OUR OWN WAY DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE LIFE A LITTLE BETTER. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT BILL SAID, BECAUSE WHEN HE AND I MET ALL THOSE YEARS AGO, AND STARTED A CONVERSATION THAT IS STILL GOING ON TODAY, WE HAD A MUTUAL LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY AND A BELIEF THAT POLITICS IS THE WAY YOU MAKE DECISIONS IN A DEMOCRACY. PEOPLE COME TOGETHER, THEY LISTEN TO EACH OTHER. SOMETIMES THEY ARGUE. AND THEN THE VOTERS MAKE A CHOICE. AND, HOPEFULLY, IF WE MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE, AS WE HAVE MORE TIMES THAN OFTEN IN OUR HISTORY, AMERICA KEEPS MOVING FORWARD WITH PROGRESS. SOMETIMES WE GET A LITTLE OFF COURSE, BUT THEN WE MAKE A COURSE CORRECTION AND GET BACK ON THE TRACK OF PROGRESS AND A BETTER FUTURE. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I KNOW AMERICA CAN DO BETTER, AND I BELIEVE THAT TOGETHER -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> TOGETHER WE CAN SET BIG GOALS FOR AMERICA, AGAIN, AND WE CAN BEGIN TO WORK ACROSS THE HARDY DIVIDE AND QUIT ACTING LIKE REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS, AND START ACTING LIKE AMERICANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT AMERICA FACES. [CHEERS AND A. [APPLAUSE] ?. [. >> YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S CONFRONTING OUR COUNTRY AT HOME AND ABROAD, I AM CONFIDENT AND I'M OPTIMISTIC, AND I AM DETERMINED. BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN'T DO ONCE WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY OWN LIFETIME, OR MY DAUGHTER'S LIFETIME, WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY POSITIVE CHANGES. BUT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED ABOUT AMERICA. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE GREAT AND GOOD NATION WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNLESS WE EACH DO OUR PART. SO, YOU SEE, I DON'T THINK THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ME OR ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WHO ARE RUNNING. I THINK THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES, AND YOUR FUTURES, AND WHAT, TOGETHER, WE WILL DO TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP FAITH WITH PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> AND I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO CHART OUR OWN FUTURE, AGAIN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THE AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE, SO THAT EVERY BOY OR GIRL, EVERY YOUNG STUDENT HERE AT THIS SCHOOL, HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO FULFILL YOUR AMERICAN DREAMS, AS THE REST OF US HAVE. [DHEERS] >> NOW, HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT? WELL, WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT BY, NUMBER ONE, WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS. IT'S THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT HAS BEEN THE BACKBONE OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE THAT I'M MR. FROM A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY. I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO, AND I KNOW THAT I WAS GIVEN AN EXTRAORDINARY START IN LIFE BECAUSE I HAD TWO PARENTS WHO NOT ONLY LOVED ME, BUT INVESTED IN ME AND DISCIPLINED ME AND GAVE ME THE ADENNION I NEEDED. AND I HAD A COMMUNITY THAT INVESTED IN SCHOOLS AND PARKS. BUT I HAD A COUNTRY, A COUNTRY THAT REALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WASN'T RICH PEOPLE, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, WHO MADE MANAGER GREAT, IT WAS THE PEOPLE WHO GOT UP EVERY MORNING, WENT TO WORK EVERY MORNING, BUILT UP THE BUSINESSES, DID THE HARD WORK, CREATED THE BETTER OPPORTUNITY. SO HERE'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO. NUMBER ONE, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY, AGAIN, THAT IS PRODUCING GOOD JOBS, WITH GOOD BENEFITS FOR HARD-WORKING MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT TILTED AGAINST THOSE WHO GET UP AND WORK HARD EVERY DAY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? OUR TAX CODE FAVORS THE WEALTH THINK AND THE WELL-CONNECTED. THAT'S NO SURPRISE TO YOU. AND THAT HAS BECOME SUCH A PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY'S INCOME HAS GONE DOWN $1,000 IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. PEOPLE ARE FEELING IT, WHILE THE INCOMES OF THE C.E.O.'s, AND THOSE WHO MAKE THEIR MONEY FROM INVESTMENTS HAVE GONE UP. THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT USED TO BE IN MANAGER. NOBODY IN AMERICA BEBRIDGES ANYBODY'S FINANCIAL SUCCESS, WE BELIEVE IT'S THE AMERICAN BIRTH RIGHT TO DO AS WELL AS YOU CAN . IT SEEMS LIKE THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST YOU, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. WE NEED A PRE, AGAIN, WHO WILL SIDE WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, AND MAKE SURE THOSE AT THE VERY STOP OF THE INCOME SCALE START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, AGAIN, TO CONTRIBUTE AND SACRIFICE FOR AMERICA. AND WE'RE GOING TO START CREATING AND KEEPING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CAN GIVE THAT MIDDLE CLASS STANDARD OF LIVING BACK TO PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, TOO MANY PEOPLE STILL EXPORT JOBS WITH HELP FROM THE AMERICAN TAX CODE. I TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S A FREE MARKET, THAT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE IN AMERICA. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO MOVE THEIR JOBS TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO STOP THEM BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM A PENNY TO MOVE THOSE JOBS OUT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. >> AND WE'RE GOING TO QUIT HAVING PEOPLE WHO MAKE $50 MILLION, PAY A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME TO TAXES THAN SOMEBODY WHO GETS PAID $50,000. YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON WALL STREET WHO ARE PAYING 15% AND 17% THAT. IS NOT FAIR. WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO FAIRNESS. FAIRNESS IS A FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN VALUE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE KNOW IT WHEN WE SEE IT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ENOUGH OF IT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> WE ARE ALSO GOING TO MOVE BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY, SOMETHING I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE IN, SOMETHING I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT MY HUSBAND DID. HE INHERITED A DEFICIT AND A DEBT. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN BILL LEFT OFFICE WE HAD A PROJECTED 5-POINT TRILLION SURPLUS, YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE NOW? A $9 TRILLION DEBT. WE GET UP EVERY DAY IN AMERICA AND WE BORROW BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE BORROW MONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SMART STRATEGY FOR AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND WE ARE GOING TO START CREATING MORE JOBS HERE. HOW WILL WE DO THAT? I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. I KNOW THAT ST. LOUIS HAS BEEN A REAL CENTER OF SO MUCH OF WHAT BUILT AMERICA. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE. I LOOK AROUND AND LOOK AS YOU, AND I KNOW THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN SATISFY INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING SURE THAT AMERICA REMAINS STRONG. WELL, NOW WE HAVE A NEW CHALLENGE AND A NEW OPPORTUNITY. THERE'S NO REASON FOR US TO CONTINUE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL. IT'S BAD FOR OUR SECURITY, IT'S BAD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT, AND IT'S BAD FOR OUR ECONOMY. SO, HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I AM GOING TO SET A CHALLENGE FOR AMERICA, LIKE I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WE WOULD SEND A MAN TO THE MOON AND BRING HIM BACK SAFELY WITHIN A DECADE. WE DID THAT. I WANT US TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN -- THAT'S RIGHT, RIGHT HERE IN ST. LOUIS, PART OF THE CONTRIBUTION. THERE WAS SO MUCH THAT HAPPENED RIGHT HERE THAT MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO US, OUR ECONOMY AND OUR SECURITY. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO SET A GOAL THAT WE WILL MOVE TOWARD ENERGY END PEN DANCE WITH HOMEGROWN ENERGY AND SET OUT A SET OF POLICIES THAT WILL GIVE US ALL A WAY OF MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT GOAL. I HAVE A STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN THE PAST, WHERE WE PUT MONEY INTO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR TECHNOLOGY AND NEW PRODUCTS. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT AND HERE'S HOW WE WILL FUND IT, WE WILL TAKE THE TAX SUBSIDIES AWAY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES AND PUT IT TO WORK ON SOLAR AND WIND AND GEO THERMAL AND BY OH FUELS. AND WE WILL START BEING MUCH MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT. THAT'S SOMETHING ALL OF US CAN DO. WE WILL HAVE STANDARDS AND TAX INCENTIVES SO YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY A MORE EFFICIENT CAR AND GET YOUR HOME INSULATED AND SAVE MONEY ON YOUR HEATING BILLS. WE CAN DO THIS. I AM QUESTIONING TO BE THE PRESIDENT THAT SAYS LET'S GET THE WORLD TOGETHER. LET'S MAKE SURE THE WORLD IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION HERE. WE NEED THE GREENHOUSE GAS ASSOCIATIONS TO COME AND WORK WITH US. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE OIL COMPANIES AND OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO STAND IDLY BY WITH $100 A BARREL OIL. WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS AND WE SHOULDN'T AFFORD IT. INSTEAD WE WILL GET SERIOUS ABOUT HOW WE REDUCE OUR INDEPENDENCE. I KNOW WE WILL NOT DO ANY OF THIS UNTIL THE TWO OIL MEN LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT AS SOON AS THEY DO, I WILL LEAD US IN A NEW DIRECTION THAT WILL GIVE US BACK OUR FUTURE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD JOBS. GUESS WHAT, THESE ARE JOBS YOU CAN'T OUTSOURCE. IF WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT GEOTHERMAL AND SOLAR AND WIND -- I TELL YOU, I WAS AT A TRAINING FACILITY, ANY ELECTRICAL WORKERS HERE? ANYBODY FROM I.V.W.? I WAS AT AN I.V.W. TRAINING FACILITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING TRAINED TO PUT IN SOLAR PANELS. THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND. >> SOMEBODY MIGHT THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY DO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NO, NO. NO. IN GERMANY THEY PUT 2,000 PEOPLE TO WORK IN SOLAR POWER AND GERMANY'S CLIMATE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ST. LOUIS. I KNOW IF WE MADE UP OUR MIND WE WOULD BE AS FOCUSED ON SOLAR, YOU WOULD HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO MAKE THEIR LIVING AND DO THE RIGHT THING AT THE SAME TIME. ARE YOU READY FOR THAT KIND OF CHALLENGE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> AND WE ALL KNOW THAT A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY NEEDS HEALTH CARE, BUT IT'S BECOME SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. SO WE NEED A NEW WAY OF FINANCING HEALTH CARE. AND YOU, I AM SURE, REMEMBER THAT BILL AND I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT A FEW YEARS AGO. WELL, WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL, BUT I AM PROUD WE TRIED, IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET US TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO PROPOSE. I'M GOING TO PROPOSE THAT WE OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH PLAN. CONGRESS HAS A GOOD PLAN FOR ITSELF, ITS STAFF AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES THIS IS A PLAN WITH MORE THAN 250 OPTIONS. THIS IS A PLAN THAT INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY. AND IF IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE, WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS, SO THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH CARE. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE COVERED. I WANT TO ASK, HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UNINSURED, WHO HAS NO HEALTH INSURANCE? AND HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, MAYBE YOU YOURSELF THAT HAS HAD HEALTH INSURANCE BUT YOU HAD TO FRIGHT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO GET PAID FOR YOUR DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL. WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THEM. MY PLAN, THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN WILL SAY, LOOK, IF YOU ARE HAPPY WITH THE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU HAVE, MAYBE YOU GET IT FROM YOUR EMPLOYER, MAYBE YOU HAVE A UNION CONTRACT. NOTHING CHANGES. WE WON'T DISRUPT ANYBODY'S HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT IF YOU ARE UNINSURED, WE WILL GIVE YOU THE HEALTH CARE YOU DESERVE AND WE WILL DO IT WITHOUT CREATING A NEW GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY AND WITHOUT HAVING GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE. IF WE FOLLOW THE MODEL I AM PROPOSING, AND WE BUILD ON THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER SIDE WILL SAY, YOU KNOW, THEY WILL STAND UP AND SAY, WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY ASK YOUR CONGRESSMAN, DOES HE HAVE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE? I DON'T THINK SO. THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY HAVE. IN FACT, I THINK YOU DESERVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT PLAN, BECAUSE AS TAXPAYERS YOU PAY FOR 75% OF THE COST ANYWAY. SO IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONGRESS, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND, YOU KNOW, EDUCATION IS STILL THE PAST PORT TO OPPORTUNITY, THAT'S WHY I AM SO HAPPY TO BE IN THIS SCHOOL. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT BEGINS AT THE VERY BEGINNING. I CAN'T TO DO MORE TO HELP FAMILIES BETTER PREPARE THEIR OWN CHILDREN. I HELPED TO START A PROGRAM IN ARKANSAS, THE HOME CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM FOR PRESCHOOL YOUNGSTERS. BILL AND I USED TO TALK ABOUT HOW HARD IT WAS FOR FAMILY TIEGS GET READY FOR SCHOOL BECAUSE FAMILIES DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE WILL BEGIN WORKING WITH THEM AND ENLIST VOLUNTEERS AND MENTORS TO HELP FAMILIES TO GET THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE THE BEST THEY CAN BE. AND THEN I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM FOR 4-YEAR-OLDS SO EVERY CHILD, ESPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN GET PREPARED. AND WE HAVE TO END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. IT IS NOT WORKING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> AND ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES IS THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO COLLEGE, BUT IT'S GOTTEN SO EXPENSIVE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT ANY MORE. IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE NOW THAN IT WAS 30, 40 YEARS AGO. HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. I WANT TO HAVE TAX CREDITS, $3,500 A YEAR FOR EACH CHILD SO THAT YOU CAN HELP PUT MONEY ASIDE AND SPEND IT ON BEHALF OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION. I WANT MORE DIRECT PROGRAMS, LIKE THE PELL GRANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT NEED SOME DIRECT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO ADD THE PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES OF THE STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO MANY FAMILIES. YOU KNOW, YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION IS NOT JUST YOUR OWN INVESTMENT. WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN YOU. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL, I HAD TO WORK, I HAD TO EARN MONEY. I HAD TO GET A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP. MY PARENTS COULD HELP ME WITH COLLEGE BUT COULDN'T GET ANY MONEY FROM LAW SCHOOL SO I BORROWED MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, 2% INTEREST. I WASN'T BANKRUPT. I MEET YOUNG KIDS TODAY, 9%, 10% ON THESE LOANS. THEY COME OUT LIKE THEY ARE INDENTURED SURE VAUNTS. AND A LOT OF THEM FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T DO THE JOB THEY WANT TO DO BECAUSE OF THE LOANS. SO HERE'S WHAT I WILL DO, IF YOU WANT TO DO NATIONAL SERVICE BEFORE YOU GO TO COLLEGE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY AND PUT IT TOWARDS COLLEGE. AND IF YOU GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE WITH A DEBT, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO A PUBLIC SERVICE JOB LIKE TEACHING OR NURSING OR LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PAY OFF YOUR DEBT SO YOU DON'T CARRY THAT THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT I WANT US TO THINK NOT ONLY ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GO TO COLLEGE, BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T GO TO COLLEGE OR GRADUATE. THESE ARE DECENT, HARD-WORKING YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, THEY GET UP EVERY MORNING, AND THEY BUILD THE BUILDINGS WE LIVE AND WORK IN. THEY FIGHT MOST OF THE WARS OUR COUNTRY WAGES. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO START DOING MORE TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE AT A BETTER FUTURE? LET'S HAVE MORE JOB TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM, HELP FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ANY YOUNG AMERICAN WILLING TO WORK HARD. LET'S GIVE THEM A GOOD FUTURE WITH A MIDDLE CLASS STANDARD OF LIVING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. NOW, IN ORDER TO DO THIS, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT. GOT TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. I THINK THAT GIVEN THE INTERNET, WE SHOULD PUT SO MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OUT THERE SO THAT YOU, THE CUSTOMERS, THE CITIZENS, AND THE TAXPAYERS, CAN SEE WHERE YOUR MONEY IS GOING, AND YOU CAN BEGIN TO HOLD EVERYBODY, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT, ACCOUNTABLE. YOU KNOW, I LAY OUT ALL THESE PLANS AND SOME PEOPLE SAY OH, MY GOSH, SHE TALKS A LOT ABOUT POLICY AND WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO. THE REASON I DO THAT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO TRY TO DO IF YOU ARE SO GOOD TO GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO SERVE YOU. I WANT YOU TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE. I WANT YOU TO SAY OK, YOU SAID YOU WERE DOING HEALTH CARE, WHERE IS IT. >> HOME GROWN ENERGY? WHERE IS IT. WE SHOULD HAVE BLOGGERS INSIDE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE SHOULD BE GIVING OUT INFORMATION ON A DAILY BASIS SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR GOVERNMENT. NOW, WE ALSO HAVE TO END THE CRONYISM AND THE CORRUPTION AND THE NO-BID CONTRACTS. THIS HAS BEEN AN OUTRAGE. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOUR GREAT NATIVE SON, HARRY TRUMAN, DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, WHICH WAS A WAR TO SAVE CIVILIZATION, HE HEADED UP A COMMITTEE ON WAR PROFITEERING. HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, THESE COMPANIES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF NOT JUST THE TAXPAYERS, THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. AND YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE COMPANIES THAT GOT THESE NO-BID CONTRACTS THAT NEVER PRODUCED A THING, NEVER BUILT WHAT THEY SAID THEY WOULD BUILD, HAVE CAUSED ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS. WELL, WE ARE GOING TO END THESE NO-BIT CONTRACTS. WE ARE GOING TO END THE OUTSOURCING OF OUR GOVERNMENT INTO PRIVATE HANDS THAT ARE UNACCOUNTABLE AND DON'T PRODUCE POSITIVE RESULTS. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I HAVE THIS, YOU KNOW, OLD FASHIONED IDEA HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE POSITIONS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND, OF COURSE, THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD. I'LL TELL YOU, THAT STARTS WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE SAID THAT ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF MY PRESIDENCY, IF I AM SO LUCKY TO BE THERE, I WILL ASK THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, MY SECURITY ADVISORS TO GIVE ME A PLAN I CAN START BRINGING MY TROOPS HOME IN 60 DAYS. SOME PEOPLE SAY WHY CAN'T YOU START IMMEDIATELY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT PLANNING HAS BEEN DONE. I AM NOT SURE THEY HAVE DONE THE KIND OF IN-DEPTH PLANNING YOU NEED TO WITHDRAW TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT. YOU KNOW, LAST SPRING I SENT A LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND SAID I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING ABOUT WITHDRAWAL. THEY WROTE BACK AND SAID I AM IN THE GOING TO TELL YOU. I SAID, OH, YES YOU ARE. WE HAD A HEARING AND IT WAS CLASSIFIED AND WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, IT WAS CURSORY. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE DONE THE IN-DEPTH PLANNING AND ANYONE WHO HAS SERVED OUR COUNTRY KNOWS WITHDRAWING TROOPS IS DANGEROUS, TAKING OUR TROOPS OUT? CONVOYS ALONG THOSE ROADS WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT. WE HAVE TO PLAN. WE ALSO HAVE TO ASK WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE 100,000-PLUS CIVILIANS THERE WORKING FOR THE EMBASSIES, WORKING FOR BUSINESSES, WORKING FOR CHARITABLE GROUPS. AND I ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WITH WHAT ABOUT ALL THE IRAQIS WHO SIDED WITH US? WHAT ABOUT THE IRAQIS WHO WORKED FOR AMERICANS? YOU KNOW, IN 2005, I WENT INTO FALLUJAH, AFTER THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH, AND IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE EFFORT BY THE MARINES TO TAKE BACK FALLUJAH LITERALLY HOUSE BY HOUSE, AND I MET THE YOUNG CAPTAINS AND LIEUTENANTS AND SERGEANTS WHO HAD BEEN THE LEADERS OF THAT EFFORT. AND I KNOW ONE YOUNG MA REASON CAPTAIN WHO TOLD ME, IF IT HASN'T BEEN FOR HIS TRANSLATOR, HE AND HIS MEN WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED. BUT THEN HE SAID, YOU KNOW, NOW EVERYONE KNOWS THIS MAN IS A MARINE TRANSLATOR, SO HE AND HIS FAMILY IS TARGETED. AMERICA IS AN HONORABLE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND THE PEOPLE WHO SAVED THE LIVES OF OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS IN BATTLE IN IRAQ. [CHAIRS AND APPLAUSE] >> AND WHEN WE BRING OUR TROOPS HOME, WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. THEY NEED HEALTH CARE, THEY NEED THE COMPENSATION THEY HAVE EARNED. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GOING TO COME HOME NOT ONLY WITH VISIBLE INJURIES, BUT A LOT OF INVISIBLE ONES, AS WELL. I WAS OUT AT WALTER READ A FEW MONTHS AGO AND VISITING SOME OF THE NEW YORK SOLDIERS, AND SEE IF THEY ARE GETTING TAKEN CARE OF. WE HEARD SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WERE BEING WAREHOUSED, THEY WEREN'T BEING GIVEN THE ATTENTION AND HELP THEY DESERVED TO HAVE. I MET A YOUNG ARMY CAPTAIN WHO HAD BEEN IN A CONVOY THAT WAS ATTACKED AND BOMBED IN BAGHDAD. AND HE HAD LOST HIS RIGHT ARM AND HE LOST THE RING FINGER ON HIS LEFT HAND BECAUSE HIS WEDDING RING MELTED INTO HIS FINGER. I SAID, CAPTAIN, HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE SAID I AM GETTING ALONG, LEARNING HOW TO USE THE PROSTHESIS, AND THE PEOPLE HERE HELP ME, BUT WHERE DO I GO TO GET MY BRAIN BACK. HE IS THE VICTIM OF THE SIGNATURE WOUND OF THESE WARS CALLED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. HE SAID, YOU KNOW MA'AM, I WENT TO WESTPOINT, NOBODY EVER HAD TO TAKE CARE OF ME. NOW MY WIFE HAS TO GIVE ME A LIST EVERY TIME I LEAVE THE HOUSE TO TELL ME WHERE TO GO AND WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO. >> I HAVE TALKED TO HIM AND SO MANY OTHERS. I HAVE LOOKED AT THEIR FACES, MET THEIR FAMILIES, AND I KNOW THAT WHEN SOMEONE SIGNS UP TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY, OUR CONDUCT HAS TO SERVE THEM IN RETURN. AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> -- THAT WE GIVE THESE YOUNG RETURNING VETERANS A 21st CENTURY G.I. BILL OF RIGHTS WITH MONEY THEY CAN USE TO GO TO COLLEGE OR START A BUSINESS OR MAYBE BUY A HOME. I WILL DO NEVER MY POWER TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF OUR VETERANS FROM OUR YOUNGEST TO OUR OLDEST AND I WANT TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE VETERANS OF MY GENERATION WHO SERVED AND FOUGHT IN VIETNAM WHO NEVER GOT THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES AND THE RESPECT THEY DESERVED TO HAVE WHEN THEY CAME HOME. NOW, THERE'S A LOOT FOR US TO DO AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP. I WANT YOU TO BE PART HAVE NOT JUST AN ELECTION. BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS WINSTON CHURCHILL WHO SAID ""THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POLITICIAN AND A STATES PERSON IS THAT THE POLITICIAN FOCUSES ON THE NEXT ELECTION AND THE STATES PERSON FOCUSES ON THE NEXT GENERATION."" I WANT US TO FOCUS ON THE NEXT GENERATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THIS ELECTION, LIKE EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. IT IS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF THESE YOUNG STUDENTS THAN IT IS ABOUT SOMEONE MY AGE. BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS KEEP FAITH WITH WHAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS DID FOR US. YOU KNOW, OVER AMERICAN HISTORY, WE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT TOMORROW WOULD BE BETTER THAN TODAY IF WE DID OUR PART, IF WE WORKED HARD, IF WE MADE COMMITMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS. SO I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT NOT ONLY TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY BUT TO ENLIST YOU. WE CAN HAVE THE GREATEST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD AND GET EVERYBODY COVERED, BUT IF PEOPLE DON'T TAKE BETTER CARE OF THEMSELVES, WE WON'T BE AS HEALTHY AS WE SHOULD BE. IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS AND GIVE THEM A GOOD START IN LIFE THEY WON'T BE AS HEALTHY AS THEY SHOULD. WE CAN HAVE A GREAT ENERGY POLICY ON PAPER THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL, BUT IF WE DON'T DO OUR PARTS TO CONSERVE AND BE ENERGY-EFFICIENT, IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, WE WILL STILL BE UNDER THE THUMB OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE OUR MONEY AND USE IT AGAINST US. SO WE ENLIST EVERYBODY, TURN OFF THOSE LIGHTS, DON'T SEND THAT MONEY TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY. DRIVE MORE EFFICIENTLY. WE HAVE TO START THINKING LIKE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF AMERICA DID WITH THEIR EYE ON THE FUTURE AND THE KIND OF FUTURE WE WANT TO GIVE TO OUR CHILDREN. WE CAN CHANGE AND MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN HOW WE DO EDUCATION POLICY, BUT STUDENTS HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE IN A COMPETITION GLOBALLY NOW. IT DIDN'T USED TO BE LIKE THAT, BUT NOW THESE YOUNG STUDENTS, THEY ARE NOT JUST COMPETING WITH SOMEBODY IN CHICAGO AND DALLAS. THEY ARE COMPETING WITH PEOPLE IN BEIJING, NEW DELI, ALL ACROSS THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO LIGHT A FIRE UNDER OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO HELP THEM TO SET THAT HIGHER DIRECTION AND SET THOSE GOALS TO ACHIEVE. SO I CAME HERE, I SENT OUT THE CALL, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIE, AND I CAME HERE TONIGHT TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP AND TO ASK FOR THE HELP OF PEOPLE ACROSS THIS STATE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. I BELIEVE WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVED WHAT HARRY TRUMAN BELIEVED, THAT THE BUCK STOPPED IN THE OVAL OFFICE. I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT AND MANAGE THE ECONOMY, BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS HANDS ON, NOT HANDS OFF, AFTER WHAT WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> SO BETWEEN NOW AND FEBRUARY 5th, I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE PART OF THIS ELECTION FOR A GENERATION, THAT YOU WILL SIGN UP AND VOLUNTEER, TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PICKING A PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 5th, AND WE HAVE TO PICK SOMEONE THAT CAN BE READY TO LEAD ON DAY ONE, AS SOON AS YOU WALK INTO THAT OVAL OFFICE AND SEE THAT STACK OF PROBLEMS THAT IS WAITING. .. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?196368-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"HALL MEETING. THIS IS HER FIRST TRIP TO IOWA AFTER ANNOUNCING HER INTENTION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. IOWA IS EXPECTING TO HOLD THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUS IN 2008. LIVE COVERAGE NOW ON C-SPAN. [CHEERS] [CLAPPING] >> GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MY NAME IS MIKE, AND ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENTS, THE STAFF AND THE ENTIRE EAST SIDE COMMUNITY, I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TODAY TO THE NEW COMMUNITY CENTER ON THE CAMPUS OF EAST HIGH SCHOOL. [CHEERS] IT IS OUR DISTINCT HONOR TO BE ABLE TO HOST ONE OF THE FIRST UP TO MEETINGS, AS WE BEGIN THE LONG JOURNEY TO THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER 2008. AS YOU KNOW, WE IOWANS WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR FIRST IN THE NATION STATUS. SO AT THIS TIME -- [CHEERS] -- SO AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE YOU TO HELP ME WELCOME SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON AND OUR CONGRESSMAN. . WE ARE NOT USED TO GETTING APPLAUSE LIKE THIS. IT AIN'T TOO BAD. AS IS TRADITION AT EAST HIGH SCHOOL, WE ALWAYS PRESENT THE COLORS AND PLAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. AT THIS TIME, WE WILL ALL PLEASE RISE AS THE 2006/2007 COLOR GUARD WILL PRESENT OUR NATION'S COLORS. >> AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE MICROPHONE OVER TO CONGRESSMAN BOSWELL. >> HELLO, IOWA. EVERYBODY, WE ARE PROUD TO BE HERE AT EAST HIGH TODAY. THANK YOU FOR LETTING US COME HERE TO START THE CONVERSATION. I WOULD JUST SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS. I AM VERY PROUD OF OUR STATE AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR COUNTRY, WHICH IS EVERY FOUR YEARS WE ELECT A PRESIDENT. >> WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY, AND I SAY THIS TO YOU SENATOR CLINTON, WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING US, WE ARE GOING TO EVALUATE AND QUESTION. WE WANT OUR COUNTRY TO GO FORWARD. FOR THE YEARS THAT I HAVE KNOWN THIS LADY, HILLARY CLINTON, I KNEW HER AS FIRST LADY, YOU DID TOO, AND I HAVE WATCHED HER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD TIME TO HAVE CONVERSATION WITH HER. WE WATCHED WITH CONCERN -- YES. WE WATCHED WITH CONCERN AND CURIOUSTY AS SHE MOVED INTO HER JOB AS UNITED STATES SENATOR. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I CAN TELL YOU, FROM MY CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR HARKIN, I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OBSERVATION WORKING AND TALKING WITH HER COLLEAGUES, MY COLLEAGUES, SHE IS A GREAT U.S. SENATOR, AND SHE HAS PROVED IT IN HER WORK, HER PRODUCTION, SHE WENT BACK AFTER THE FIRST TERM, AND THEY ELECTED HER WITH 67%. WOW! I'LL JUST PICK ON YOU HARRY BOOK AND A FEW OTHERS OUT THERE, TO SPEAK TO OUR CHILDREN, MY WIFE AND I IN IND DEPENDS, MISSOURI WITH OUR GRANDCHILDREN TODAY. I SAY THIS TO MY DAUGHTER CINDY, AND MY OTHER DAUGHTERS, DIANA, TERRY, CARLY WHO IS MAYBE IN THE AUDIENCE SOMEWHERE, FIGHTING A DIABETES SITUATION, I SAY TO ALL OF YOU: YOU CAN DO IT! [ APPLAUSE ] >> HILLARY, WE WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS. LET THE CONVERSATION BEGIN. GOD BLESS YOU. WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE! >> THANKS SO MUCH. THANKS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU ALL! >> WELL, I'M HILLARY CLINTON, AND I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE IN IOWA, TO BE HERE AND PART OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE THAT WE ARE BLESSED TO HAVE, OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, AND IT STARTS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA, AND I -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, AND I'M IN IT TO WIN IT! [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND I INTEND TO DO IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. I INTEND TO COME AND TALK WITH YOU AND LISTEN TO YOU IN YOUR LIVING ROOMS AND YOUR CHURCH BASEMENTS AND YOUR UNION HALLS WHEREVER YOU GATHER BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY, AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU MY IDEAS, MY VISION, BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING. I WANT TO HAVE THIS AS A ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION, JUST YOU AND ME AND ABOUT SEVERAL HUNDRED NATIONAL PRESS PEOPLE, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THAT WILL FADE AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO PURSUE THIS CONVERSATION IN A VERY PERSONAL WAY. YOU KNOW, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I WANT TO RENEW THE PROMISE OF AMERICA -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> BEING HERE AT THIS GREAT HISTORIC HIGH SCHOOL -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> WITH YOUR PRINCIPAL, MIKE, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND BEING SO HELPFUL. I ALSO WANT TO THANK EAST HIGH ACTIVITIES COORDINATOR SHARON LINK WHO WORKED HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I WANT TO THANK THE EASTS JAZZ BAND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF CHRIS STROMEYER, AND THE EAST HIGH SCHOOL 2006/2007 COLOR GUARD UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MICHELLE EGG WILL STON. >> WHEN I SAW THOSE YOUNG WOMEN BRINGING FORTH OUR FLAG, IT ALWAYS HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON ME. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SO MUCH TO BE PROUD OF. WE HAVE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE ARE SO BLESSED, BUT WE CANNOT TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED, AND I FEAR THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HAPPEN HAPPENING. WE HAVE BEEN REVERSING THE PROGRESS THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE ENJOYED. I WAS BORN INTO A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY IN THE MIDDLE OF AMERICA. I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO. I WAS RAISED IN A SUBURB. MY DAD WAS A WORLD WAR II VET LIKE SOME OF YOU HERE TODAY, AND HE BELIEVED THAT YOU WORK HARD, PLAY BY THE RULES, DO WHAT YOU CAN TO FURTHER YOUR OWN LIFE, YOUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE ON YOUR SIDE. YOUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO STAND WITH YOU, BACK YOU UP, AND YOU WILL PROVIDE A BETTER FUTURE FOR YOUR CHILDREN. I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE IN THAT BASIC BARGAIN, THAT PROMISE. I DON'T THINK I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SOME IN POWER IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT. THAT INDEED -- THEY HAVE OVERLOOKED THE FACT THAT AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE WE HAVE PROVIDED OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE. BECAUSE WE CREATED THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS OUT OF WHICH MANY OF US CAME AND ARE A PART OF, BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE ARE RICH PEOPLE IN EVERY AREA OF THE WORLD, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE POOR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT AMERICA IS THAT WE HAVE CREATED THIS PHENOMENON WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAD THE CHANCE TO LIVE FAR BEYOND THE DREAMS OF OUR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS. NOW, I SEE THAT AT RISK. I SEE THAT THE PROMISE OF AMERICA IS BEING UNDERMINED. BAD DECISIONS COMING OUT OF OUR GOVERNMENT BY AN IDEOLOGY THAT DISREGARDS WHAT IT TAKES TO PROVIDE THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR FAMILIES AND HARD WORKING INDIVIDUALS TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY CAN HAVE A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE HEADLINES TODAY. C.E.O. PAY IS SKYROCKETING TO WHAT I CONSIDER OUTRAGEOUS LEVELS. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE INCREASING. AND PRODUCTIVITY IS UP. THAT'S HOW HARD THE AMERICAN WORKER WORKS, AND NOBODY WORKS HARDER THAN AMERICAN WORKERS. WE ARE THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD! YET, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE? WAGES ARE NOT UP. INCOME IS NOT UP. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IS UP, HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE UP. EDUCATION COSTS ARE UP. ENERGY COSTS ARE UP. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN YOU HAVE MORE BANKRUPTCIES IN AMERICA LAST YEAR THAN COLLEGE GRADUATES. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HARD WORKING PEOPLE CAN'T GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN NEED. [ APPLAUSE ] I HAVE WORKED MY ENTIRE LIFE ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ON BEHALF OF WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL AS HERE AT HOME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE A LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCES AS WELL AS QUALIFICATIONS FROM ALL THE WORK THAT I HAVE DONE THAT MAKE ME PARTICULARLY WELL PREPARED TO TAKE OFFICE IN JANUARY 2009. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOW, I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO EITHER SAY OR WONDER, WOULD WE EVER ELECT A WOMAN PRESIDENT? [ APPLAUSE ] >> I DON'T THINK WE WILL KNOW UNTIL WE TRY. I'M GOING TO TRY. WITH YOUR HELP, I THINK WE CAN DO IT. YOU KNOW, BUT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT BREAKING A HISTORIC BARRIER LIKE THAT, THOUGH THAT IS WHAT AMERICANS ARE GOOD AT. WE ARE GOOD AT BREAKING BARRIERS AND GOING PLACES KNOWN HAS GONE TO BEFORE. I WANT TO SEE US GET BACK TO THAT. THIS IS ABOUT DOING WHAT WE DO TOGETHER. THIS IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND SMART SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH OUR PROBLEMS, BUT WE ALSO NEED GOOD SI SENSHIP, PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND WORK WITH US. WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH MIKE AND SOME OF THE TEACHERS BEFORE I CAME IN, WE HAVE TO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP. THE SCHOOLS CAN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN. WE HAVE TO HELP BY GETS FAMILIES FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY CAN DO TO PREPARE THEIR CHILDREN FOR SCHOOL. >> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HEALTH CARE, THE DOCTORS AND NURSES CAN'T DO IT ALL BY THEMSELVES. WE HAVE TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF OURSELVES. WE HAVE TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON STAYING WELL AND PREVENTING ILLNESS AND DISEASE. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ENERGY, WE DESPERATELY NEED AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WILL MOVE US TOWARD INDEPENDENCE, BUT IT WILL REQUIRE THAT WE CHANGE SOME OF OUR HABITS. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO BE MORE CONSERVATION MINDED, MORE EFFICIENT. THIS IS THE PARTNERSHIP THAT TWISTS IN AMERICA BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY. CONVERSATIONS IN WASHINGTON THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONE SIDED. IT'S ALL BEEN IN ONE DIRECTION. SO I AM SO EXCITE ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. I AM DELIGHTED THAT MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE CONGRESSMAN BOSWELL COULD BE HERE WITH ME TODAY BECAUSE WE GO WAY BACK. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I JUST WANT TO PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL BE HERE OVER AND OVER AGAIN TRYING TO MEET WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE WITH ME. WE MAY NOT SEE THE WORLD EXACTLY THE SAME, BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. I WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. I WILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. I THINK OUR COUNTRY IS AT A TURNING POINT. WE HAD A GREAT RUN OF IT IN THE 20TH CENTURY. NOBODY COULD OUT COMPETE US. NOBODY HAD A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT WE ARE IN A NEW WORLD NOW AND WE HAVE NOT ADJUSTED TO THAT COMPETITION. I HAVE BEEN TO SOME OF THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE COMPETING WITH US, AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF BEING READY TO GET OUT THERE AND WIN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THAT MEANS WE CANNOT CEDE ADVANTAGE TO OUR COMPETITORS. WE HAVE TO BE READY HERE AT HOME, AND THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ENFORCE TRADE AGREEMENTS, TO PUT ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS IN THEM. TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO COUNTRIES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR MARKETS, THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE PATSIES ANYMORE, WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME, I DON'T THINK A WOMAN CAN BE ELECTED PRESIDENT, I SAY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, BUT WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT. WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME I DON'T THINK AMERICA CAN FACE UP TO ITS PROBLEMS, MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS, I SAY DON'T YOU COUNT US OUT. WE MAY NOT HAVE HAD GOOD LEADERSHIP THE LAST SIX YEARS BUT WE ARE STILL THE MOST CAN DO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, AND PACKING THIS GYMNASIUM. I STOPPED IN THEOVER FLOW ROOM IN ANOTHER GYMNASIUM AND THE PRINCIPAL TOLD ME THAT THEY COULDN'T GET IN HERE, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO LAIR PEOPLE ON TOP OF YOU. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LET THE QUESTIONS BEGIN. I WELCOME THE QUESTIONS ON YOUR MIND. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU. I'LL TRY TO GET TO AS MANY QUESTIONS AS I CAN AND IN A 360-DEGREE CIRCLE SO I DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE OUT. I THINK WE HAVE A MICROPHONE, OR IT WILL BE HARD, OTHERWISE, TO HEAR. >> HELLO, GREAT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, SENATOR CLINTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE ARE THRILLED. I AM SO EXCITED THAT THERE IS A FEMALE CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS TIME WE HAD A WOMAN PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. >> THE 43 PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD YOUR JOB BEFORE YOU, YOUR FUTURE JOB, HAVE ALL BEEN MEN. MY QUESTION IS, HOW IS YOUR CAMPAIGN PREPARED TO TACKLE THAT ISSUE? THANK YOU. >> WELL, IT IS A FACT THAT OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN DOMINATED, UNTIL RECENTLY, BY MEN AND BY WHITE MEN, BUT OVER THE TIME OF THE LAST 50 YEARS, LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED. WE HAVE HAD AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS AND WOMEN. WE HAVE 16 WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE WORK TOGETHER. WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER. WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE. WE COME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL POINTS OF VIEW. THOSE 16 OF US THERE TODAY ARE AS MANY AS HAVE EVER SERVED PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN 32. WE ARE AT A POINT WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING. THINK OF WHAT IT FELT LIKE WHEN YOU SAW NANCY PELOSI BECOME THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. >> [ APPLAUSE ] >> I DON'T THINK I AM THE ONLY WOMAN HERE THAT FEELS THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WORK HARDER, RIGHT? I AM PREPARED TO DO THAT. I WILL WORK AS HAR AS I CAN IN THIS CAM PAPER, BUT LET'S REMEMBER THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT HAPPENS IN JANUARY 2009. THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE A BEGINNING THAT LEADS TO AN AGENDA THAT CAN BRING A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS TOGETHER SO THAT I CAN MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS WE ARE GOING TO CONFRONT. I FEAR THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT ARE GOING TO LEAVE A PRETTY BIG HOLE TO BE DUG OUT OF. I EXPECT THAT THEY'LL PROBABLY BE MORE STORIES ABOUT MY CLOTHES AND HAIR THAN SOME OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING AGAINST ME. I JUST HAVE ACCEPTED THAT. YOU KNOW, THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER KIND OF FUNNY STORIES ABOUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US OR A LITTLE BIT OF THE DOUBLE STANDARD, BUT I REJECT THAT. I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE BEYOND THAT. I AM GOING TO BE ASKING PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR ME BASED ON MY ENTIRE LIFE AND EXPERIENCE. THE FACT THAT I AM A WOMAN, A MOM, IS PART OF WHO I AM. I AM GOING TO ASK PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE PERSON THEY BELIEVE WILL BE THE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] >> [ LAUGHTER ] HI, I'M ALLEN COZ LOW, I'M THE LOCAL PHYSICIAN AND STATE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION HERE. DIABETES IS THE FASTEST GROWING COST INCREASE IN OUR HEALTH CARE COST. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT GETTING UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE AND SECONDLY ABOUT THE CRISIS OF DIABETES IN OUR COUNTRY? >> THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS, THANK YOU. I AM COMMITTED TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. I BELIEVE -- [ IE APPLAUSE ] >> I BELIEVE THAT WE FINALLY ARE CREATING A CONSENSUS IN OUR COUNTRY FOR THAT GOAL. I REMEMBER ALL TOO WELL BACK TO '93 AND '94, AND I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS, BUT I THINK WE AS A NATION NOW HAVE SO MANY MORE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. THE PROBLEMS WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS BACK THEN ARE STILL WITH US, IN FACT, THEY ARE WORSE. WE HAVE MORE UNINSURED AMERICANS. WE HAVE MORE AND MORE BUSINESSES FEELING UNDER TREMENDOUS GLOBAL PRESSURE AND ARE CUTTING BACK AND CUTTING OUT HEALTH CARE. WE CONTINUE TO SPEND MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE SPIND 16% OF OUR ENTIRE NATIONAL INCOME ON HEALTH CARE. THE NEXT HIGHEST SPENDING COUNTRY, CANADA OR SWITZERLAND SPEND 11% OF THEIR INCREASE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT QUALITY INDICATORS FROM AROUND THE WORLD, WE OFTEN DON'T DO THE BEST JOB. OUR PATCH WORK OF SYSTEMS IS A SYSTEM FOR SICKNESS, NOT FOR WELLNESS. WITHWITH RESPECT [ APPLAUSE ] >> WITH RESPECT TO DIABETES, WHICH IS A FAST GROWING COST IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, 20% OF OUR MEDICAID COST, 20% IS SPENT ON DIABETES. WHAT THE DOCTOR IS ATTEMPTING TO COPE WITH IS THE FACT THAT AN INSURANCE COMPANY IS UNLIKELY TO PAY FOR THE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE CARE OF SOMEONE WITH DIABETES. IT'S HARD TO GET AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO PAY FOR THE VISIT TO THE PE DIE TRYST OR NUTRITIONIST, BUT THEY'LL PAY TO HAVE YOUR FOOT AMPUTATED. THE INCENTIVES IN OUR SYSTEM ARE UPSIDE DOWN AND BACKWARDS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> PART OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. WE NEED OUR DOCTORS, NURSES, HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS, EMPLOYERS, FAITH COMMUNITY, PUBLIC OFFICIALS, WE NEED EVERYBODY TO FACE UP TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE HAVING A CRISIS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IT IS NOT GOING TO GET BETTER UNLESS WE ACT, AND WE HAVE TO COVER EVERYBODY. WE HAVE TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND WE HAVE TO CONTAIN COSTS SO THAT THE MONEY CAN BE BETTER DIRECTED. I AM GOING TO START BY INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO ENSURE EVERY CHILD. THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO GIP BEGIN WITH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WHEN I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I WORKED TO HELP CRAFT THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, AND IT HAS WORKED WELL, BUT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEGUN TO CUT IT BACK, AND CHILDREN HAVE BEGUN TO LOSE COVERAGE. WE HAVE CHRONICALLY ILL CHILDREN THAT ARE HAVING TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES. I THINK IF WE CAN START WITH THIS CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT TO ENSURE CHILDREN, AND THAT WOULD BE A GOOD BEGINNING, THEN, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IDEAS I HAVE AND HEAR FROM YOU. THERE ARE SEVERAL IDEAS THAT I THINK WOULD WORK, AND I HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO SEE STATES MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION, AND TO HAVE BIPARTISAN REFORMS THAT WE NEED. I HAVE IDEAS, BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMEONE PRECIOUS TO ME AND EMBODIES THIS DEBATE FOR ME. BACK IN 1994, I WAS AT AN EVENT TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES AND EXPENSES THAT FAMILIES WITH SERIOUSLY ILL CHILDREN FACE. I HAVE DONE WORK IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, ON THE BOARD OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. I GAVE ALL THE MONEY FROM ""IT TAKES A VILLAGE"" TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. FOR ME, THIS IS INTENSELY PERSONAL. I WAS AT THIS EVENT. I WAS TALKING TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO TO REFORM HEALTH CARE. THERE WAS THIS YOUNG BOY SMILING AT ME. AT THE END OF IT, I CAME TOWARD HIM. HE PUT HIS HANDS UP. I REACHED DOWN TO PULL HIM UP, AND HE WAS IN A BODY CAST. THAT'S HOW I MET RYAN. HE HAD A FORM OF DWARFISM. HE AND HIS FAMILY EXPERIENCED UNBELIEVABLE MEDICAL EXPENSES. WE KEEP IN TOUCH, AND I WROTE ABOUT HIM IN MY BOOK ""LIVING HISTORY"" BECAUSE HE WON MY HEART. HE IS HERE WITH ME TODAY. I AM SO PROUD BECAUSE HIS FAMILY WAS ABLE, WITH TERRIBLE EFFORT AND LOTS OF OBSTACLES FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES, TO GIVE HIM THE CARE HE NEEDED, AND THEY HAVE STAYED IN TOUCH WITH ME. HE IS NOW A 4.0 STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA. [ APPLAUSE ] >> FOR ME THIS IS NOT ABOUT AB STRAXES, THIS IS ABOUT RYAN, ABOUT THE MANY CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHOM I KNOW PERSONALLY. MY OFFICE IN THE SENATE, WE HANDLE SO MANY CASES BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS A SICK CHILD OR SICK RELATIVE, AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T PAY FOR THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED. THERE WAS A MAN THAT CALLED MY OFFICE A FEW YEARS AGO FROM UP IN NEW YORK COUNTRY. THERE ARE FARMS IN NEW YORK, SMALL TOWNS AND VILLAGES. WE GOT A CALL FROM THIS MAN IN WHAT WE CALL THE NORTH COUNTRY. THEY TOLD ME ABOUT HIS SON WHO WAS IN DESPERATE NEED OF AN OPERATION AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID NO. WE WENT TO BAT FOR HIM AND GOT HIM THE OPERATION. AS HAPPY AS I WAS TO TAKE CARE OF HIM, I THOUGHT WHAT A SAD COMMENTARY THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO THE SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES TO GET THE CARE YOU NEED FOR YOUR CHILD. >> WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT AND HEALTH CARE AND DIABETES. >> YOU HAVE TO PASS THE MIC BACK A BIT. >> MRS. CLINTON, NICE TO SEE YOU. >> NICE TO SEE YOU. MY NAME IS JOHN BARRY. I WAS A VETERAN IN THE FIRST WAR. I UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THIS 21,000, WILL THERE BE MORE, OR WILL WE BE ABLE TO CURB THIS WAR? I WAS NOT AT 9/11, BUT I SAW IT ON T.V. LIKE MOST PEOPLE. THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR MY QUESTION, AND WE AS AMERICA LOVE YOU, AND I THINK YOU LOOK VERY NICE. >> I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FUND OUR V.A. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERAN, THERE IS NO IFS, ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT IT. >> I WAS IN ONE OF OUR MILITARY HOSPITALS ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. I WAS TALKING TO A LOT OF THE DOCTORS AND NURSES THAT WERE TAKING CARE OF OUR SOLDIER HEROS COMING BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ AND ELSEWHERE. THEY GET GREAT CARE. WHEN THEY GET TO THE V.A. SYSTEM NOW, THE CARE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS. I AM VERY PROUD OF THE WORK DONE DURING THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TO IMPROVE THE V.A. SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE HAD TO FIGHT EVERY YEAR TO KEEP IT FUNDED. IT JUST DEFIES MY UNDERSTANDING HOW WE COULD HAVE TAKEN A BALANCED BUDGET AND SURPLUS THAT THIS PRESIDENT INHERITED IN 2001. WE HAVE SQUANDERED IT. WE HAVE NOT MET THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE, OR THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE SUCH AS TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS, SO I WILL PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS IN THE SENATE TO FUND THE V.A. SYSTEM, TO MAKE SURE WE WILL NOT CLOSE HOPS TO OUR RETURNING VETS, AND I HOPE WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE A GUARANTEED FUNDING SO WE DON'T IS TO FIGHT TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF US. >> I HAVE YOUR BOOK, ""IT TAKES A VILLAGE"". I HAVE THE FIRST COPY, AND I BOUGHT THIS ONE RECENTLY. IT'S DELICIOUS. >> THANK YOU, I WILL AUTOGRAPH IT AFTER WE ARE FINISHED. >> WHAT, THERE? ONE OF THE FOLKS UP IN THE BLEACHERS. >> HELLO, I'M FROM CHICAGO. I WAS BORN ON THE SOUTH SIDE AND GREW UP IN THE NORTHWEST SUBURBS. A FRIEND OF MINE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH YOU AND SLEPT OVER ON SLEEP OVERS. >> I HOPE SHE DOESN'T TALK TO ME MUCH. >> I DON'T THINK SHE PUT YOUR UNDERWEAR IN THE FREEZER. ASIDE FROM THAT, I'M A TEACHER. I HAVE BECOME AN IOWAN. I CAME HERE TO GET A TEACHING JOB BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED, THERE WERE A LOT OF TEACHERS OUT THERE. I CAME TO IOWA TO GET MY JOB. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE LOSING TEACHERS. ONE BECAUSE OF PAY. IOWA, I AM PROUD TO BE A TEACHER. THIS IS MY 30TH YEAR, AND I DO TEACH RAGING PEW BESS ANT HORMONAL INDIVIDUALS, AND THE HARD THING IS I AM GOING THROUGH MEN PAUSE. I LOVE THEM. IN IOWA, WE HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL RECORD WITH EDUCATION, YET, OUR PAY FOR TEACHERS RATES VERY LOW. WHEN I SEE THAT OUR YOUNG MEN ARE BEING SENT TO IRAQ, AND ALL THAT MONEY GOING THERE, I THINK ABOUT, AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, IT TAKES AVILLE AGE TO RAISE A CHILE, -- CHILD, BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, HOW DO WE BUILD THE VILLAGE TO RAISE THE CHILD? >> EXCELLENT POINT. >> FIRST, LET ME THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR YEARS OF TEACHING, AND LET ME THANK ALL THE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS THAT ARE HERE. I KNOW HOW DEPENDENT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON MY TEACHERS. I CAN GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO KINDERGARTEN AND WHAT THEY DID FOR ME. YOU MAKE THREE POINTS THAT I WANT TO UNDERSCORE. FIRST, IF WE DON'T DO MORE TO INSENT VISE PEOPLE TO GO INTO AND STAY IN TEACHING, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE TEACHERS WE NEED FOR THE 21ST CENTURY BECAUSE TOO MANY OF OUR TEACHERS HAVE BEEN THERE A NUMBER OF YEARS. YOU HAVE TAUGHT 30 YEARS. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE GOING ON 35 YEARS. THEY STILL LOVE IT, BUT TIME IS PASSING BY. WE NEED TO BRING IN MORE PEOPLE FROM OTHER PROFESSIONS AND OTHER WALKS OF LIVES, AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? YOU HAVE TO MAKE TEACHING ATTRACTIVE. IT IS A CALLING. I MET TWO PEOPLE LAST NIGHT AND THEY SAID THEY WERE TEACHERS, AND FELT CALLED TO TEACH. IT IS A CALLING, BUT IT IS ALSO A WAY OF LIFE THAT HAS TO PROVIDE A LIVING. WE HAVE TO HAVE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THE MIX BETWEEN MEETING TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN OUR TEACHERS AND PROVIDING THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO BE COMPETITIVE SO TEACHERS WILL BE ABLE TO STAY TEACHING AND MAKE A LIFE COMMITMENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I HAVE ONLY BEEN IN THE STATE ABOUT A DAY NOW, 24 HOURS, BUT I HAVE ALREADY HEARD A LOT ABOUT NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. THE IDEA BEHIND IT WAS NOT A BAD IDEA, BUT THE WAY IT'S BEEN EXCUTED, LIKE A LOT OF THINGS WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS A LOT TO BE DESIRED, HASN'T IT? >> [ APPLAUSE ] >> ONE OF THE REASONS IS, IT'S NEVER BEEN FUNDED THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNDED AND PROMISE TO BE FUNDED. WE ARE GOING TO BE REAUTHORIZING THAT AND SEE WHAT TO DO WITH IT. I THINK YOU WILL SEE POSITIVE CHANGES COMING OUT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS NOW. I HOPE THAT WILL PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO THE LOCAL SCHOOLS. THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGIC THAT GOES ON BETWEEN THE TEACHER AND STUDENT. THIS IS ALL ABOUT THAT MOMENT OF TURNING THAT YOUNG PERSON ON TO SOMETHING THAT MAY BE THEIR LIFE'S WORK. YOU CAN'T DICTATE THAT FROM ON HIGH. YOU CAN'T WRITE RULES ABOUT THAT. THIS SCHOOL HAS A HISTORY AND PROUD LEGACY OF KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES. I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH YOUR NEW ADDITION. PRESIDENT CLINTON TEAMED UP WITH SENATOR HARKIN TO PASS MONEY TO BE HANDED DOWN TO REPAIR AND REBUILD AND MODERNIZE OUR SCHOOL BUILDINGS THAT WERE UNDER PROPERTY TAX AND OTHER PRESSURES. I KNOW THAT -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> I KNOW THAT SENATOR HARKIN WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THAT. HE AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON LEGISLATION TO TRY TO REINSTATE THAT. AS SOON AS THE NEW ADMINISTRATION CAME IN, THAT WAS ENDED. YOU DON'T GET FEDERAL HELP, YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH OF THE FEDERAL MONEY PROMISED TO FULFILL THE FEDERAL MANDATES PUT ON YOU, SO WE HAVE TO FLIP THIS AND GET BACK TO FOCUSING ON THE EDUCATIONAL ENTERPRISE. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO ADD ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP. FAMILIES AND STUDENTS HAVE TO BE PARTNERS WITH THEIR TEACHERS. THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> TO PREPARE THEIR CHILDREN FOR SCHOOL. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS. HARD WORKING FAMILIES, THANKS FOR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE HERE. THANKS TO YOUR NEW GOVERNOR. WHEN YOU HAVE A HARD WORKING PARENT, MAYBE A SINGLE MOM AND YOU SAY YOU SHOULD READ TO YOUR CHILD AT NIGHT, THAT'S A LITTLE HARD, RIGHT? WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THROUGH OUT REACH, USING OUR CHURCHES AND MENTORING PROGRAMS, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER PREPARE OUR CHILDREN, THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT PRESCHOOL AND HEAD START SO THEY CAN GO TO SCHOOL READY TO LEARN. THERE IS A LOT WE NEED TO DO. YES? >> I'M A SOCIAL WORKER. WE JUST HEARD FROM A TEACHER. I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT WORK THAT HAS TYPICALLY BEEN WOMEN'S WORK IS SO UNDER VALUED, TEACHERS, NURSES, CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FLIP. THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T KNOW THE TEACHERS WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IT PAYS SOCIAL WORKERS WELL. >> WE ARE THE LOWEST PAID NURSES IN THE STATE. HOW DO WE CHANGE THE CULTURE TO VALUE THE CARE TAKING ROLES THAT WOMEN PRIMARILY FORM? IMAGINE ALL OF THE PERSONAL WORK THAT IS DONE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN, ELDERLY, EACH OTHER. ONE, I HAVE LEGISLATION TO EXPAND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE EQUAL PAY ACT. I BELIEVE THAT -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> THAT WE PASSED THE LEGISLATION SOME TIME AGO, AND WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS, AND I AM PROUD OF THAT, BUT IT IS STILL NOT EQUITABLE. THIS SNOT JUST A WOMEN ISSUE, IT'S A FAMILY ISSUE. IF SHE'S MARRIED, THAT ADDS TO THE INCOME OF THE FAMILY. IF SHE IS SINGLE? WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE TREATED FAIRLY TO GET THE PAY THAT SHE DESERVES? >> THERE IS NOT JUST A LEGAL ASPECT TO THIS. WHEN I CAME OUT TO SAY I WANTED TO DO THIS, THERE WERE THOSE THAT CRITICIZED AND SAID WOMEN CHOOSE TO GO INTO THOSE PROFESSIONS. THEY ARE LOWER PAID PROFESSIONS. IN A SENSE, YOU ARE GETTING WHAT YOU BARGAINED FOR BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE REASON WOMEN DON'T GET PAID MORE IS BECAUSE THEY TAKE TIME OUT TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN OR ELDERLY RELATIVES IN THE ROLES WE IE ASSUME. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A CURIOUS ARGUMENT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP LEVELS OF SOCIETY, YOU LOOK AT BIG CORPORATIONS AND GREAT UNIVERSITIES, THERE IS STILL PAY EQUITY THERE TOO. M.I.T. DID A SURVEY CONCERNING TENURED PROFESSORS, MEN AND WOMEN. WHAT DID THEY FIND? THE WOMEN TENURED PROFESSORS, WHO ARE THE MOST EDUCATED, MOST ADVANCED DEGREES, NEVER GOT OFF THE TRACK, STAYED ON WHAT THEY WERE DOING. THERE WERE DISPARATEYS. THERE IS A CULTURAL COMPONENT TO THIS. WE CAN CHANGE LAWS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE ATTITUDES. WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO TREAT 'OTHER WITH RESPECT, NO MATTER OUR GENDER OR BACKGROUND. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SEE EACH AS A PRECIOUS HUMAN BEING AND TREAT EACH OTHER WITH FAIRNESS AND COMPASSION. >> OKAY, THIS IS BETTER. FIRST, I WANT TO SAY THAT IN RESEARCHING YOUR BACK BACKGROUND, I ADMIRE YOUR ADEQUACY FOR CHILDREN, WOMEN, PEOPLE THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED. YOU STARTED BEING AN ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN THROUGH THE WELFARE SYSTEM AND DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES. AS A FOSTER PARENT, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN FOSTER PARENTS IN TWO DIFFERENT STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS A HODGEPODGE OF RULES AND REGULATIONS AND THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO AND RIGHTS THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE, AND THE RIGHTS THAT FAMILIES HAVE. IN SOME STATES, THE PARENT OF THE CHILD CAN GRAB THE CHILD AND RUN TO ANOTHER STATE AND HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES. DO YOU FAVOR OF TAKING THIS TO A NATIONAL LEVEL INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT TO THE STATE TO DO AS THEY WILL. >> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU AND YOUR WIFE FOR BEING FOSTER PARENTS. I STARTED OUT WAY BACK IN LAW SCHOOL DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF FOSTER CHILDREN. IT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE WORKED ON MY ENTIRE PUBLIC CAREER. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. WE NEVER WANT TO BREAK UP A FAMILY. THERE ARE SOME FAMILIES, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY TREAT THEIR CHILDREN OR THEIR INABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN THAT PRESENT SUCH DANGERS TO THEIR CHILDREN, THAT UNFORTUNATELY, THE STATE COMES IN AND TAKES THOSE CHILDREN. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, EVERY ONE OF US BECOMES THE FAMILY OF THAT CHILD. WHEN SOMEONE IS REMOVED FROM AN ABUSIVE HOME, TAKEN INTO THE STATE, THAT BECOMES OUR CHILD. WE WANT TO RETURN THE CHILD TO HIS FAMILY IF POSSIBLE. SOMETIMES WE CAN, AND LOTS OF TIMES WE CAN'T. WE HAVE NEARLY 500,000 CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN OUR COUNTRY. A WILL THE OF THEM VERY YOUNG. WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT MOVES MORE QUICKLY TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. IF THEY CAN BE RETURNED HOME, WE NEED TO DO THAT. WE NEED TO GIVE MORE RESPECT TO GRANDPARENTS. IF A GRANDPARENT CAN TAKE A CHILD, LET'S NOT TURN THE CHILD OVER TO STRANGERS, LET'S TURN THE CHILD OVER TO GRANDPARENTS. I HAVE WORKED ON THIS VERY HARD. AS FIRST LADY WE TRIED TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WE APPROVED MORE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT COULD GO TO HOMES, BUT WE WERE LIKE RUNNING IN PLACE BECAUSE MORE AND MORE CHILDREN KEPT COMING IN. LET'S HAVE A MORE COHESIVE SYSTEM BECAUSE IF A CHILD IS TAKEN AWAY IN ONE STATE, IT CAN LANGUISH IN FOSTER CARE FOR YEARS. IN THE STATE NEXT DOOR, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG EFFORT TO RETURN HIM OR FREE HIM FOR ADOPTION. I DO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A NATIONAL APPROACH TO THIS BECAUSE THESE CHILDREN ARE TOO PRECIOUS. THEY ARE OUR CHILDREN. WE NEED MORE GOOD PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO BE FOSTER PARENTS LIKE YOU UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. OH MY GOODNESS, UP THERE. >> OKAY, FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY LIKE WHAT A GREAT HONOR IT IS TO SEE YOU AND ASK THE QUESTION, YOU ARE ONE OF MY IDOLS, AND YEAH. SO, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME I'M VOTING IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AS A YOUNG PERSON, I AM VERY CONCERNED WITH GLOBAL WARMING. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS ON ENFORCING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES? >> GREAT QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I AM SO ENCOURAGED AND EXCITED BY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. I HOPE YOU FEEL, AS I DO, WE HAVE THE BEST YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. THEY ARE FABULOUS. THEY ARE BECOMING SO ACTIVE AROUND A COUPLE OF ISSUES, AND ONE OF THEM IS GLOBAL CLIMATE EXCHANGE AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY. LET ME BRIEFLY SAY THAT I THINK WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONGRESS. UP UNTIL NOW, IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT REFUSE TO ADMIT THAT THERE ARE ANY HUMAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. THERE ARE CHANGES THAT ARE SO CALLED NATURAL, BUT WE HAVE SO CHANGED THE ATMOSPHERE THAT IT HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT. YES, THERE ARE NATURAL REASONS THAT THE CLIMATE MAY GET WARMER, BUT WE PUT SO MUCH CO2 INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT IT CHANGES THE ATMOSPHERE. OF COURSE, IT IS REAL AND A THREAT. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS CREATE THE POLITICAL CONSENSUS -- WHICH WE ARE WORKING ON NOW, TO GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN AMERICA TO SUPPORT THESE CHANGES AND TO GET THE POLITICS TO CHANGE ITSELF SO THAT WE CAN MAKE LAWS TO IMPROVE OUR CONDITIONS. THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT I AM ADVOCATING. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO TAKE A STRONG STAND ON LIMITING OUR DEPENDS ON FOREIGN OIL. >> [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE HAVE A PERFECT EXAMPLE RIGHT HERE IN IOWA ABOUT HOW IT CAN WORK, WITH ALL THE ETHANOL BEING PRODUCED HERE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOW, ACROSS THE COUNTRY, LOTS OF WORK IS BEING DONE TO CREATE ETHANOL OUT OF THINGS OTHER THAN CORN. IN NEW YORK, WE ARE USING FAST GROWING WILLOW. WE CAN USE FARM WASTE AND OTHER HOME GROWN ELEMENTS TO POWER OUR CARS, CHANGE THE WAY WE USE GASOLINE. WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK TO OUR CAR MANUFACTURES TO GIVE HIGHER GAS MILEAGE IN OUR CARS. [ APPLAUSE [ ] >> THERE ARE WAYS OF DOING THAT THAT ARE NOT GOING TO FURTHER UNDER CUT OUR AUTO INDUSTRY, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DO IT. I HOPE IN THIS NEXT YEAR, WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE WILLING NSZ ON THE PART OF OUR PRESIDENT AND CONGS. THE PRESIDENT CAN DO SOME THINGS, BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE THAN THAT. WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP OUR OLD, COAL BURNING UTILITIES AND GET THEM CLEANER BECAUSE THEY ARE SPEWING SO MUCH MERCURY AND CO2 IN THE AIR. I PROPOSE WHAT I CALLED A STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND THAT WILL BE SUB SI SUBSIDIZED BY THE AUTO INDUSTRY. AND, IF WE TOOK THAT MONEY AND PUT IT INTO THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND, WE COULD MASSIVELY INVEST IN THE BEST IDEAS TO FURTHER BIO FUELS AND BIO DIESEL AND GET SOLAR CHEAPER AND MAKE WIND ACCESSIBLE, LOOK AT HIDE DEGREE POWER, LOOK AT ALL OF THE ALTERNATIVES. [ APPLAUSE ] >> BUT, I THINK THIS WILL TAKE A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, AND I WAS HAPPY TO SEE COMPANIES LIKE GE, STAND UP AND SAY TO THE GOVERNMENT, OUR GOVERNMENT, PLEASE, IMPOSE STANDARDS AND CAPS ON THE AMOUNT OF C.O.2 GOING INTO THE AIR. THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT BECAUSE WE CAN TURN TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS AND SAY, YOUR SUPPORTERS, BIG BUSINESS LEADERS NOW ARE WILLING TO DO WHAT YOU WILL NOT DO WHICH IS PUT THE UNITED STATES BACK INTO THE LEAD ON CONTROLLING THE CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATE. WE HAVE BEEN MISSING IN ACTION, AND WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. >> SENATOR? SENATOR? >> THEY TELL ME YOU HAVE TO GET ON THE ROAD TO CEDAR RAPIDS, AND SINCE I HAVE TO DO THE DIRTY WORK, THEY SENT ME UP HERE. >> LET ME TAKE JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS. IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY IN CEDAR RAPIDS, TELL THEM I MAY BE A LITTLE LATE. >> I'M FORTUNATE TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE DES MOINES EDUCATION ASSOCIATION HERE. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT EDUCATION AND THE DIRECTION OF EDUCATION THAT HAS BEEN INFLUENCED QUITE HEFLLY, WE THINK IN A NEGATIVE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT WHICH WE CALL ""NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND"". ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IS THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH PROFESSIONAL SAY ABOUT THOSE CLOSEST TO THE CHILDREN AND WHAT TEACHING IS REALLY ABOUT. CERTAINLY, THE NOTION THAT STUDENT LEARNING IS NOT EQUAL TO TEST STORES IS SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE BACK TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AS SENATOR. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND ALSO, THAT OUR KIDS ARE WHOLE KIDS, THEY HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF THEIR PARTS DEVELOPED, NOT JUST READING AND MATH. >> RIGHT. RIGHT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OUR CONCERN IS THAT WHILE THE SLOGAN ITSELF SOUNDS VERY GOOD NOT TO LEAVE CHILDREN BEHIND, IT'S NOT JUST AN EMPTY PROMISE, IT HAS FLAWED PREMISES. WEWE WOULD HOPE THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE LANGUAGE AND FRAMING THAT IS MEANT TO PUSH TOWARD PRIVATIZATION OF SCHOOLS AND VOUCHERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND THAT WE COULD ALSO THEN TALK ABOUT REALLY RETURNING OUR SCHOOLS BACK TO THE PLACES WHERE WE DEVELOP HUMAN BEINGS AND CITIZENS THAT THRIVE IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND A DIVERSIVE CHANGING WORLD, AND NOT JUST THEIR TEST SCORES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THAT . . >> THIS GOES BACK TO THE DOCTOR'S FIRST QUESTION. ONE OF THE REASONS I WOULD ARGUE IS WE HAVE AN INCREASE OBESITY IS WE NO LONGER HAVE PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND LET THEM PLAY OUTSIDE AND HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE. [APPLAUSE] SO YOU'VE GOT TO SEE LIFE HOLISTICALLY AND WE'VE TAKEN CHILDREN AND BASICALLY SAID THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO LEARN, AND HERE IT IS. AND WE'RE GOING TO TEST YOU ON IT. WHAT DOES THAT TO THE CHILDREN OR ARTISTICALLY INCLINED OR IMAGE THATTIVE AND NEED TIME TO DEVELOP THEIR SKILLS AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE? AND SO HERE'S MY PLEA. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SCHOOL REFORM ISSUES SINCE 1983, WHEN MY HUSBAND ASKED ME TO CHAIR A COMMITTEE IN ARKANSAS. AND WE CAME UP WITH A LOT OF IDEAS AND THE DEBATE HAS GONE ON EVER SINCE THEN. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY HITTING THE TARGETS WE EVEN SET. AND I WOULD ARGUE SOME OF THE TARGETS ARE THE WRONG TARGETS, BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN HITTING THOSE. WE ARE NOT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE GOING IN TO MATH AND SCIENCE. WE ARE NOT TURNING OUT MORE EDGE NEARS AND RESEARCHERS TO COMPETE WITH CHINA AND INDIA. SO WE'VE GOT TO RETHINK THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE CAN DO WITH THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND DEBATE GOING ON IN THE CONGRESS. I'M CONFLICTED HERE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY HANDS UP. I PROMISE I WILL BE BACK AND ANSWER QUESTIONS. AND THE OTHER THING I WILL DO IF I CAN, IS STAY HERE. WE'LL LET PEOPLE FOR, BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SO PATIENT. I WILL STAY HERE AS LONG AS I CAN, IF YOU DIDN'T GET TO ANSWER ASK A QUESTION OR HAVE SOMETHING TO AUTOGRAPH, YOU COME ON UP AND I'LL STAY RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW ARE YOU? HOW OLD ARE YOU? (music) [INDISCERNIBLE] (music) (music) [INDISCERNIBLE] (music) [INDISCERNIBLE] (music) >> HILLARY CLINTON LIVE IN DES MOINES, IOWA. SHE'S BEEN SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS WITH SOME OF THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?196512-5/clinton-campaign-speech,Clinton Campaign Speech,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"TODAY, NEW YORK SENATOR HILARY RODHAM CLINTON. THIS IS JUST UNDER 20 MINUTES. >> OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] HELLO, DEMOCRATS! [APPLAUSE] WELL, I'M HILARY CLINTON, AND I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] I'M IN, AND I'M IN TO WIN BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK. THIS CAMPAIGN THAT WE'RE GOING TO WAGE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE EVER HAD IN OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO NEED EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER AND GETTING THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT. NOT ONLY ADDING TO OUR NUMBERS IN THE CONGRESS BUT TAKING BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] AND I WANT TO THANK MY LONG-TIME FRIEND, GOVERNOR DEAN, FOR HELPING TO LEAD THE CHARGE FOR THE VICTORIES WE HAD IN NOVEMBER OF '06. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE STATE CHAIRS AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BECAUSE THIS WAS A UNIFIED EFFORT, AND I KNOW HOW HARD EVERYONE WORKED, AND THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP TO GET THE CONGRESS BACK. TO BEGIN TO TRY TO REIN THE PRESIDENT, TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO DO ALL WE CAN TO HOLD THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE AND TO TRY TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE AND LIMIT WHAT ELSE MIGHT COME OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. NOW, I KNOW A LOT OF DEMOCRATS FEEL AS THOUGH WE JUST WANT THIS ELECTION TO BE HERE, AND WE DO, DON'T WE? [APPLAUSE] BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN WITHIN THE CONGRESS TO TRY TO SET A NEW COURSE, AND IT'S CHALLENGING. YOU KNOW THAT. WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE UNDER THE GREAT LEADERSHIP OF SNEAKER PELOSI. [APPLAUSE] AND WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS, AND THE IN THE SENATE WE HAVE INCREASED OUR NUMBERS. BUT WE STILL HAVE TO CREATE COALITIONS IN ORDER TO GET THE VOTES WE NEED TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ARE SO NECESSARY. THIS IS WHAT I PLEDGE TO YOU FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS -- THAT I WILL WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THEN WHEN I AM PRESIDENT WORKING WITH A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, WE WILL REALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND PUT IT ON THE RIGHT TRACK AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I AM NOT HERE TODAY JUST TO START A CAMPAIGN. I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF CAMPAIGNS OVER THE YEARS. I'M HERE TO START A CONVERSATION WITH OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO ADMIT TO OURSELVES THAT THINGS ARE JUST NOT RIGHT. WE'VE LOST SOMETHING THESE LAST SIX YEARS. ALL OF YOU FEEL IT, WE KNOW IT, AND WE HAVE TO REGAIN IT. IT'S THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT MANY OF US GREW UP EXPECTING. THAT WE FELT IF YOU WORKED HARD AND DID YOUR PART, YOUR COUNTRY WOULD STAND WITH YOU. IT WOULD GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. IT WAS A BARGAIN THAT CREATED THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS, THE GREATEST SOCIAL INVENTION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, EVERY COUNTRY HAS RICH PEOPLE, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. BUT NO COUNTRY HAS CREATED THIS EXTRAORDINARY MIDDLE CLASS OUT OF WHICH MOST OF US CAME. WITH THE PROMISE OF EDUCATION AND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES. I GREW UP IN A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY IN THE MIDDLE OF AMERICA. MY DAD WAS A WORD WAR II VET WHO CAME BACK IN ORDER TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR US. HE RAN A SMALL BUSINESS PRINTING FABRICS FOR DRAPERIES AND LOTS OF TIME IT IS ONLY WORKERS HE HAD WERE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS AND ME. BUT WE WERE ALL IN IT TOGETHER, AND WE FELT BECAUSE OF THE EXAMPLE HE AND MY MOM SET THAT IF YOU SERVED YOUR COUNTRY, YOUR COUNTRY WOULD SERVE YOU. NOW WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND OUR COUNTRY, THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING. CORPORATE PROFITS AND CEO PAY ARE HITTING NEW HIGHS WHILE WAGES FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS ARE STAGNANT. LAST YEAR MORE PEOPLE WENT BANKRUPT THAN GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASING NUMBER OF THE UNINSURED, IF YOU REALIZE THE SHAME OF 26,000 VICTIMS OF KATRINA STILL LIVING IN TRAILERS, IF YOU ASK THE WORRIED MOM WHO'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DOES NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND MEAN WHEN I FEEL LIKE MY CHILDREN ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND -- [APPLAUSE] WHEN I TRAVEL ACROSS UPSTATE NEW YORK AND HARD-WORKING PEOPLE COME AND SAY, SENATOR, THEY'RE CLOSING THIS FACTORY DOWN AND SHIPPING OUR JOBS OVERSEAS. WHY CAN'T WE GET TOUGH ON CHI STPHA AND I SAY BECAUSE OF THE DEBT THAT THIS GOVERNMENT UNDER THIS PRESIDENT HAS EXPLODEED, WE ARE NOW DEPENDENT UPON CHINA, AND HOW DO YOU GET TOUGH ON YOUR BANKER? WE NEED TO START STANDING UP FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER AGAIN AND BE ABLE TO ONCE AGAIN COMPETE AND WIN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] BUT IT'S NOT JUST MANUFACTURING JOBS, IS IT? YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS IN IOWA LAST WEEKEND, I HAD A GREAT TIME, THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. I MET A YOUNG MAN, AN ENGINEER, WHO WAS TRAINING HIS REPLACEMENT. AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I DID WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. I WENT TO COLLEGE, I GOT AN ADVANCED DEGREE, I'VE WORKED HARD, AND NOW I'M TRAINING SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO MAKE ONE TENTH OF WHAT I MAKE. WE NEED A NEW ECONOMIC STRATEGY THAT WILL REBUILD THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AND GIVE HOPE TO PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT THEY'VE DONE THEIR PART, AND THEY'RE WAITING FOR THEIR GOVERNMENT TO BE ON THEIR SIDE AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO RENEW THAT PROMISE OF AMERICA. IT'S THE GREATEST PROMISE THAT ANYONE CAN BE BORN WITH OR COME TO BE PART OF. AND I WANT TO RESTORE THE GREATNESS AND RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD. NOW, I KNOW VERY WELL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DEBATING STARTING THIS WEEK IN THE SENATE A RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL OF THIS PRESIDENT'S ILL-CONCEIVED PLAN TO ESCALATE OUR INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ. NOW, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO WISH WE COULD DO MORE BUT LET ME SAY IF WE CAN GET A LARGE, BIPARTISAN VOTE TO DISAPPROVE THIS PRESIDENT'S PLAN FOR EDUCATION CALCULATION THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT WE WILL HAVE SAID NO TO PRESIDENT BUSH. AND BEGAN TO REVERSE HIS POLICIES. [APPLAUSE] NOW, I WANT TO GO FURTHER. I PROPOSE CAPPING THE TROOP LEVELS, I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO THREATEN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM THEIR TROOPS, NOT OUR TROOPS WHO STILL LACK BODY ARMOR AND ARMORED VEHICLES, BUT WE'RE GOING TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WE ARE FINISHED WITH THEIR EMPTY PROMISES AND WITH THIS PRESIDENT'S BLANK CHECK. AND LET ME ADD ONE OTHER THING, AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. IF I HAD BEEN PRESIDENT IN OCTOBER OF 2002, I WOULD NOT HAVE STARTED THIS WAR. I WOULD NOT -- [APPLAUSE] AND IF WE IN CONGRESS, IF WE HAVE IN CONGRESS WORKING AS HARD AS WE CAN TO GET THE 60 VOTES YOU NEED TO DO ANYTHING IN THE SENATE, BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION AND THE OUTRAGE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE 06 VOTES TO CAP TROOPS TO, LIMIT FUNDING, TO DO ANYTHING. IF WE IN CONGRESS DON'T END THIS WAR BEFORE JANUARY 2009, AS PRESIDENT, I WILL. [APPLAUSE] AND I EXPECT TO BE BUSY IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN JANUARY 2009 ONCE AND FOR ALL WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE, UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. [APPLAUSE] NOW, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY WHAT IS HILARY CLINTON DOING TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE? WELL, AS DR. DEAN KNOWS, THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SUBJECTS, AND I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET IT DONE. IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALLING FOR IT, END PASSIONED SPEECHES ABOUT IT, PRESENTING LEGISLATION THAT EMBODIES YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS AND ANOTHER THING TO PUT TOGETHER THE POLITICAL COALITIONS TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN. THE SAME, THE SAME IS TRUE WITH ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. THE DEMOCRATS KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AGAIN, WE'RE WORKING TO TRY TO PUSH THIS AGENDA FORWARD. THE OTHER DAY THE OIL COMPANIES REPORTED THE HIGHEST PROFITS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I WANT TO TAKE THOSE PROFITS, AND I WANT TO PUT THEM INTO A STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND THAT WILL BEGIN TO FUND ALTERNATIVE SMART ENERGY, ALTERNATIVES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL BEGIN TO ACTUALLY MOVE US TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF INDEPENDENCE. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAND AIDS ON OUR PROBLEMS. I AM RUNNING TO ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY ADDRESS THEM AND MEET THEM AND GET RESULTS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROVE TO OURSELVES AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT WE'RE STILL THE MOST CREATIVE, MOST INNOVATIVE, MOST EFFECTIVE NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATING THAT RECENTLY, HAVE WE? SO WE HAVE ALL THESE BIG CHALLENGES, AND WE NEED SMART, STRONG LEADERSHIP THAT CAN PROVIDE THE SOLUTIONS THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WE HAVE TO HAVE. I BELIEVE THAT I CAN, WITH MY LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS, MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US ONCE AGAIN TO BELIEVE IN OURSELVES BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS. PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF POLITICS AS USUAL WITH GOOD REASON. WE'RE JUST MARCHING IN PLACE. WE MAY EVEN BE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY INTERNATIONAL INDICATOR, WE DON'T HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY HEALTH CARE ALTHOUGH WE PAY MORE FOR IT THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD, WE'RE NOT SETTING HIGH GOALS AND MOVING TOWARD THEM ON ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING ALTHOUGH WE EMIT MORE GAS EMISSIONS THAN ANYBODY ELSE GLOBALLY. WE CAN DO THIS, BUT THERE'S A STRAIN OF FATALISM IN SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE CREPT INTO THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE. IF WE TRY TO DEAL WITH GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE WE'LL WRECK THE ECONOMY. I REJECT THAT. WE TRY TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, WE'LL BANKRUPT OUR COUNTRY. I REJECT THAT. I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS ON BEHALF OF POOR PEOPLE AND CHILDREN AND WOMEN AND FAMILIES. I WORKED IN ARKANSAS WITH MY FRIENDS FROM ARKANSAS TO REFORM OUR SCHOOLS AND TO REFORM RURAL HEALTH CARE. I HAVE WORKED ACROSS OUR STATE IN NEW YORK TO BRING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR SMALLEST VILLAGES AND HELP OUR FARMERS WHILE DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF 9/11 AND WHAT IT MEANT FOR THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD. YOU AND I KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED IN 2008. I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT WINNING CAMPAIGNS. [APPLAUSE] AND WHEN OUR PARTY AND OUR CANDIDATES ARE ATTACKED, WE HAVE GOT TO STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE ALWAYS DONE THAT, AND I ALWAYS WILL. I KNOW HOW THEY THINK, HOW THEY ACT, AND HOW TO DEFEAT THEM, AND IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WILL DO TOGETHER IN 2008. YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU, ME, OR ANY OF OUR WONDERFUL CANDIDATES, AND WE'VE GOT A GREAT FIELD OF REALLY STRONG AND DEDICATED CANDIDATES. THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE LEAVE TO THE NEXT GENERATION. THIS IS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN, AND I BELIEVE WE CAN MARTIAL OUR FAITH, OUR STRENGTH, AND OUR INGENUITY TO RESTORE THAT BASIC BARGAIN. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, LET'S NOT LISTEN TO THE NAY SAYERS, LET'S PLOW AHEAD AND SHAPE OUR OWN FUTURE. WE CAN MAKE HISTORY AND REMAKE OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE. WE CAN ELECT THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT, WE CAN FIX HEALTH CARE -- [APPLAUSE] WE CAN STOP GLOBAL WARMING, WE CAN STOP THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR -- [APPLAUSE] AND, YES, WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT END TO THE WAR IN IRAQ. AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS, DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE THEM. AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR CHANGE, DEMOCRATS, WE ARE THAT CHANGE. AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR UNITY, WE CAN UNIFY OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. AMERICA IS LOOKING FOR LEADERS WHO SEE WHAT THEY SEE. OUR WORLD IS CHANGING. THE THREATS WE FACE ARE REAL, BUT THE PROMISE OF AMERICA AND THE VALUES THAT SUSTAIN US ARE JUST AS REAL, AND IF WE'RE WILLING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR THEM, THERE IS NO STOPPING US. JOIN ME ON THIS JOURNEY, THANK YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS YOU! [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) FLUSH WILL ARE ARE (music)(music) >>",2015-11-07 17:19:14,2007-02-02,Washington,District of Columbia
http://www.c-span.org/video/?199807-1/huckabee-campaign-event,Huckabee Campaign Event,Mike Huckabee,"HOW ARE YOU DOING? IT IS NICE TO SEE YOU. >> MIKE HUCKABEE WHIG LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS AT THIS TIME. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR NOT ONLY TO YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE RALLY A DAY BUT ALSO FOR STANDING FOR A TAX SYSTEM THAT IS FLATTER, FAIRER, FINITE IN FAMILY FRIENDLY. WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A TAX REFORM AND A TAX REFORM IN AMERICA IS NOT SIMPLY SOMETHING WHERE WE TAKE A LITTLE HAMMER AND DO A LITTLE TAPPING AND THE TWIST WITH ASE RIVERA. WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT MINOR ADJUSTMENTS COULD THE PROBLEM IS OUR TAX STRUCTURE TODAY DRIVES JOBS FROM THIS COUNTRY AND MIGHT MISS CAPITAL FROM AMERICA, I AM A SUPPORTER PROUDLY AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY AND EMPHATICALLY FOR THE FAIR TAX WHICH IS A COMPLETE GETTING RID OF ALL THE CURRENT TAXES ON PRODUCTIVITY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WOULD END THE INCOME TAX ON INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS. [APPLAUSE] IT WOULD AND CAPITAL GAINS TAXES, IT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE PAYROLL TAXES AND EVERYTHING WERE TAXED AT A WHICH IS REALLY A TAX ON OUR SAVINGS AND A TAX FROM ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH WE EARN MONEY. IT WOULD REPLACE IT WITH A SIMPLE CONSUMPTION TAX. THE LOCKER WITH ILLEGALS BE ABLE TO AVOID TAXATION, NO LONGER WITH DRUG DEALERS BE ABLE TO AVOID BEING TAXED IT IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. >> HAVE YOU NOTICED THE BACKWARD FLAG ON THE ARMY UNIFORM? IN FULL COLOR ON A CAMEL SLUSHINESS FORM. >> THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT. >> THERE IS BUT IT IS NOT A LEGITIMATE LEG. THIS IS THE WAY THE AIR FORCE WEARS A, THIS IS THE WAY THE NAVY WHERE IS IT FROM A THIS IS THE WAY YOU DISPLAY THE FLAG, VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY. SO THEY DECIDED TO INCLUDE DEFLECTED THE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ALTER ITS THIS LATE. THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS THAT AUTHORITY IS THE SITTING PRESIDENT, WHICH I HOPE YOU BECOME. THERE IS SOME INFORMATION ABOUT FLAG ETIQUETTE AND I GETTING A PETITION TO SENT TO GEORGE BUSH AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU WOULD SIGN IT. >> THE ONLY THING, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN IRAQ THEY WERE TELLING ME WHY THEY DO IT THIS WAY HAVE THEY TOLD YOU ANYTHING? >> WHEN THEY MARCH FORWARD IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS SLANG IN THE WIND. IF YOU PUT ON THE LEFT SHOULDER IS THE REAL AMERICAN FLAG PIN THE ARMY WILL DEFEND THIS LIKE TO AND NAIL. THE ATLANTIC ON THE OTHER SIDE LIKE THE U.N. AIRCRAFT OR CARS AS I DID WHAT THEY CALL THIS IS THE REVERSE IMAGE PEAVEY DON'T HAVE THE TRUE AMERICAN FLAG, WHAT IS IT A REVERSE IMAGE OF? THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE POLICE ARE STARTING TO WEAR IT IS THAT WAY, FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE STARTING TO WEAR IT THAT WAY --. >> THEY ARE SAYING THEY DON'T WEAR IT ON THE LEFT? >> NO, THEY PUT IT THERE FOR WHATEVER REASON DID. >> I WANT TO TALK TO SOME MILITARY PEOPLE BECAUSE WHEN THEY EXPLAINED TO ME WHY THEY WERE IT, I DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH IT. THEY ARE FACING TOWARD THEIR MISSION AND NOT AWAY FROM IT. >> THAT IS TRUE IF YOU HAVE ONE AT EACH SIDE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO HANG THE FLAG UNDER HOUSE ARE PUT IN YOUR CAMPAIGN LITERATURE, WHICH PQ'S THE AMERICAN FLAG FOR THE BACKWARD FLAG? THIS IS WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD SEES. AS A GOVERNOR, I AM SURE WHICH YOU CAN PICK OUT IS THE AMERICAN FLAG PIN THIS IS THE AMERICAN FLAG SO WHY IS THIS THE DISPLAY AND REPRESENTATION OF AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD? IT IS IMPROPER AND -- IF THEY WAR ONE ON EACH SIDE, THAT IS LEGITIMATE BECAUSE OF A TRUE AMERICAN FLAG AND THEN YOU HAVE IT'S REVERSE IMAGE IF YOU WERE QUITE TO EDWIN TO YOUR SHIRT SLEEVE, HE WOULD NOT START WITH THE REVERSE IMAGE AND FORGET ABOUT THE AMERICAN FLAG. THAT IS WHY I CAME UP WITH A CAMPAIGN. >> THE TAX CODE BOTHERS ME. OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BOTHERED ME COMEDY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS DOES NOT QUITE MADE ME MAD ENOUGH TO GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT YEP IT. >> IT IS THE REPRESENTATION OF AMERICA, OUR LIVING SYMBOL. >> I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THEM, IS THERE ANY REASON THEY CAN'T DO THE OTHER? DO THIS IS AN ARMY SOLDIER, HE DOES NOT HAVE THE PATCH ON HIS LEFT SLEEVE. THIS IS THE NAVY SOLDIER, HE DOES, SO THEIR ONLY EXCUSE WILL BE THIS ID TAKE IT THEY COULD MOVE THE I.D. TAG TO THE OTHER SIDE AND HAVE THE FLAG LIKE THE COMMANDER OF SHE HAS THE FLAG. WHY DID THEY TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN FLAG? ONLY A SITTING PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO ALTER THE AMERICAN FLAG. >> IT ISN'T INTERESTING POINTS. >> CAN I GET YOU TO SIGN THE PETITION? >> WHAT ROGER BRITT PASSION TO THAT? >> WHEN I SAW POLICE OFFICERS WEARING IT AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS WEARING IT, LITTLE KIDS ARE STARTING TO DROP THEIR AMERICAN FLAGS BACKWARD AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT, SO I'M TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IT AND GET THE PRESIDENT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. >> I'VE NOT SIGNING INTO LIGHT NOTE -- I APPRECIATE IT. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> AS PROTECTING THE SERIOUSLY ILL USING MEDICAL MARIJUANA, IT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS SUPPORT FROM THE AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION. OUR CURRENT FEDERAL POLICY IS TO ARREST THE SICK AND DYING IN THE STATES TO PASS THIS LAW. YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPROVE OF OR INTO THESE RAIDS DID WHEN YOU APPROVE OF A RESTING AND RATING CANCER PATIENT? >> I DON'T SUPPORT THE IDEA OF LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. AS MANY WONDERFUL THINGS TO COME OF IT, SOME DANGERS COME FROM A. IF THEY ARE TARGETING PEOPLE, I AM NOT SURE THAT MAKES GOOD SENSE, BUT I WOULD NOT DO AND SAY THAT YOU SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THE LAW. MANY PEOPLE IN THIS RALLY TODAY BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO BE FALLING IMMIGRATION LAWS, WE HAVE TO BE FALLING SECOND AMENDMENT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND LAWS. AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO SAY, I'M GOING TO IGNORE A LOT. IF FOLKS LIKE YOU BELIEVE IN IT CAN'T GET THE LOTS CHANGED ITS. >> ASHLEY SARA 12 STATES HAVE REPAST LAWS PROTECTING THE SERIOUSLY ILL. I AM SURE WE HAVE, WE CAN PROTECT STATES' RIGHTS TO SUPPORT THAT AND PROTECT THE SICK AND DYING PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS. WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE THE RAIDS AND THE OFFICER WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IN THOSE RAIDS. IS THAT A TOP PURDIE? >> PROBABLY NOT. CHANGING THE TAX CUT IS, MAKING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WORK IS, CHANGING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS, SUCCESSFULLY WINNING THE WAR IN IRAQ IS, HAVING AN ENERGY SYSTEM THAT IS SUSTAINABLE. BUT HONESTLY A HANDFUL OF STATES HAVE CHANGED THE MARIJUANA WALLS , IT WILL BE THE FIRST THING I WILL BE WORKING ON --. >> HE WOULD CONTINUE THE RAIDS THAT? >> I WOULD NOT MAKE THAT EIGHT MAJOR PARTY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I DON'T SUPPORT THE IDEA OF LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. >> BUT YOU WITH THAT IN THE RAIDS? >> PROBABLY NOT. >> R.I., THANK YOU. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING, MIKE HUCKABEE. >> COULD KICK LAST NIGHT. >> WE HAD A GREAT TIME. >> YOU GOT YOUR HANDS FULL MORE THAN ENOUGH. >> IF I STOPPED AND ONE OF THE RANCH ON EVERYTHING ANYBODY WANTED ME TO DO, I WOULD NEVER DO -- IF PEOPLE LOOK AT WHAT I GET DONE, EDUCATION, ROAD BUILDING AND THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE, THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO I COULD BE DISHONEST AND TELL THEM I WILL TAKE ON EVERY CAUSE. >> HE ACCOMPLISHED TWO OF THE FIVE CAUSES, ONE THAT WOULD SETTLE FOR. >> PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THE ISSUES THEY DO CARE ABOUT, NOBODY IS TAKING CARE. WE ARE NAT SECURING OUR BORDERS WERE NOT -- THERE IS PLENTY ON THE PRESIDENT'S PLATE WHEN HE WALKS INTO OFFICE. THANK YOU. >> FOCUS ON THOSE MAJOR ISSUES. >> I APPRECIATE THAT BIG THANK YOU. ICU HAVE A DIFFERENT SHIRT ON, I APPRECIATE THAT. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT TO ME TO. THANKS. >> THAT IS FOR YOU COULD THANK YOU. >> 164 TOWNS HAVE PASSED A LAW TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS DID WE HAVE THE FACT SHEET THAT SOME IN HAMPSHIRE TOWNS OF SADE THE LOT OF MONEY -- I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHICH WE DO AS PRESIDENT TO PURSUE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. >> I DEVOTED A WHOLE CHAPTER TO IT IN MY LAST BOOK AND THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS I BELIEVE IN. FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT AN ENVIRONMENTALIST BUT I AM A CONSERVATIONIST. I THINK WE SHOULD BE MORE FOCUSED ON IS SERVING. STARTS INDIVIDUALLY, WRITING BIKES AND WALKING IT ALSO MEANS TAKING STEPS IN OUR OWN HOMES WHETHER FLORA'S INVOLVED -- I THINK THERE THINGS WE CAN DO BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE NEED TO BE DOING IS SENDING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL. WITH TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE TERRORISTS WHO RUN THOSE COUNTRIES, THAT IN TEN YEARS WE WILL NOT MEET THEIR OIL ANYMORE. WE WILL FIND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM SOLAR AND WIND AND COAL AND NUCLEAR AND ETHANOL AND BIOFUELS, THINGS WE CAN PRODUCE OURSELVES THAT ARE MUCH MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY THAT ARE ALSO SUSTAINABLE. WE OUGHT TO BE DOING THAT IT. >> SO WOULD YOU RESPOND TO WHAT THEY ARE ASKING AND COME UP WITH A PLAN IT WOULD INSTITUTE? >> WHAT ARE THEY ASKING? >> FOR NATIONAL LEADERSHIP TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. >> IS. >> I HAVE ARE THE EXHIBIT THAT. SO IT WOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT 150 DAYS. THANK YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. >> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? DISSED I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE AFTER-TAX BUT IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHERE IT FALLS CONSTITUTIONALLY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TAX AMENDMENTS AND THE CONSTITUTION, WE HAVE DIRECT TAXES AND WE HAVE INDIRECT TAXES. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE GORTEX IS AN INDIRECT TAX COLLECTED FROM THE PEOPLE AS THEY SPEND, NO OTHER WAY, THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY WAY? IN OTHER WORDS, WE RECEIVE OUR PAY, WE SPEND THEIR PAY, TAXES ARE COLLECTED AT THAT POINT AND ONLY AT THAT POINT. THAT IS BECAUSE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL -- THE TAX WOULD PAY TODAY THE IRS CHARGES TAXES OUR INCOME TODAY, THE TAX IT DIRECTLY WITHOUT AUTHORITY, NO AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT THEY ARE DOING AS THEY ARE COLLECTING IT. I AM ASKING YOU YOU ARE EXPRESSING THE FAIR TAX IS AN INDIRECT TAX ON CLAUSE ONE? >> THAT IS A HIGHLY TECHNICAL QUESTION. WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING YOU PAY A CONSUMPTION TAX, IT IS VERY SIMPLE. HE DID NOT GET TAXED ON YOUR PERIL COMEY DOUG A TAX AND THEIR SAVINGS ARE DIVIDENDS OR CAPITAL GAINS SCARED THERE'S NO DEATH TAX. EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE TAX CODE AS WELL. IF YOU BUY A NEW ITEM, YOU PAY A CONSUMPTION TAX BREAK IF YOU PURCHASE THE SERVICE THE EXCEPTION IS EDUCATION, OTHERWISE THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO WINNERS AND LOSERS WHICH IS THE KEY TO MAKING A TAX SYSTEM THERE >> YOU ARE TELLING ME IT IS A TAX THAT IS NOT COLLECTED BY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE BODY IN THE UNITED STATES? NO IRS. >> THE IRS WOULD DISAPPEAR. >> THERE WOULD BE THE WAY OF COLLECTING THAT TAX EXCEPT ON PAYMENT? >> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. THE MERCHANT COLLECTED AND THE MERCHANT AND THE STATE COLLECT COLLECT -- WHO PASSES ON, THEY COME OUT WITH A BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY ARE GIVEN A BASIS POINT FOR HAVING COLLECTED THE TAX, SO THERE IS NO OFFICER IN THE PROCESS AND IT SIMPLIFIES THE SYSTEM SO YOU DON'T HAVE THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED TAX SYSTEM WHERE YOU GO AROUND THE INCOME IS THIS A DEDUCTION, IS THAT A DEDUCTION? AT CUBE I JACK, YOU PAID THE TAX. IF YOU BUY A NEW SUIT, YOU PAID THE TAX. >> BUT YOU SAID IT IS ON SERVICES? >> IT WOULD BE ON SERVICES AND GOODS. SO IT WOULD BE ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU ACTUALLY COME OUT WITH -- IT WOULD END UP PAYING 23% OF YOUR TOTAL INCOME AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT AVERAGE OF -- IF YOU ARE POOR, YOU, BETTER THAN THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A REBATE BILL THAN FOR EVERY SINGLE CITIZEN WITHOUT REGARD TO INCOME BASED ON THE POVERTY LEVEL AND BASED ON THE ESTIMATED 23%. THE WEBSITE, A FAIR TAX.ORG IS A GREAT RESERVES OF INFORMATION AND HAS A LOT OF THE BACHARACH HE WAS DEVELOPED BY ECONOMISTS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. >> MIKE DIE ENTRAP YOU? USE THE WORD, YOU SAID IT WOULD BE A MORE FLAT TAX. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX LAW IS THIS. IF THE GOVERNMENT WERE TO ADMINISTER A FLAT TAX, THAT TAX WOULD IN AND OF ITSELF BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THERE WOULD BE NO AUTHORITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO COLLECT THE TAX AT ANY PERCENTAGE LEVEL. THAT WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACCORDING TO CLAUSE FOUR. MY PROBLEM IS I THINK YOU ARE TELLING ME WE ARE GOING TO COLLECT A FAIR TAX THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IT AS IF IT WERE A FLAT TAX. >> IT IS LIKE ANY CONSUMPTION TAX, IT IS A PERCENTAGE SO IS A FIXED RATE THAT IS WHY IT IS FLAT. YOU HAVE A PROGRESSIVE TAX, IF YOU MAKE MORE MONEY, THE RATE GOES UP. AND THAT IS WHY I THINK IT PENALIZES PRODUCTIVITY. THAT IS WHAT I THINK IS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM AS A THIS IS. >> THERE IS NO AUTHORITY FOR IT. DOES ANYBODY HAVE A BETTER WAY TO ASK THE QUESTION? >> YOU ARE GOING TO VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER. >> HOW YOU VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER? >> YOUR TAKING HIS PROPERTY AGAINST HIS WILL? >> IF HE DOES NOT BUY ANYTHING HE DOES NOT WANT, HE DOES NOT TAKE IT. >> THAT IS A FALSE ARGUMENT. I DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO BUY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITHOUT SURRENDERING A PERCENTAGE OF MY WEALTH? >> HOW WOULD YOU FUND SERVICES OF GOVERNMENT? >> THE WAY WE DID IN THE FIRST ONE OF YEARS WITH TARIFF. >> THEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE. LOOK AT THE WEBSITE, I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT IS A. >> I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB IN THE DEBATES. IF YOU GET THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE A DEBATE THAT INVITES THE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES, GREENS, THE LIBERTARIANS OTHER THAN THE TWO PARTY BACK-AND-FORTH WE HAVE HAD THAT REALLY ENDS UP BEING JUST A Q & A? >> IF I GOT TO CHOOSE WHOM THE DEBATE PARTICIPANTS ARE THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I DON'T CARE WHO IS ON THEIR PICK I'VE BEEN ON THE STAGE WITH NINE OTHER PEOPLE. >> ALRIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THE PROBLEM IS WHOEVER SPONSORS THOSE DEBATES. >> GOVERNOR, THE NEXT TIME THEY ASK YOU ABOUT AIR POLLUTION SAY, HE REMEMBERS HIS. >> THAT IS A GOOD LINE PICK GOOD TO SEE, YES SIR, GOOD TO SEE. >> THIS IS A FRIEND OF MINE, MIKE GILLMAN. >> WE SERVED IN THE HOUSE TOGETHER. I MET YOU AT A DINNER. I GIVE YOU MY TEN, REMEMBER? >> IT IS GREAT SEEING YOU AGAIN. >> WHEN YOU ARE IN THE HAMPSHIRE, WHERE THAT CAN PICK THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. >> HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL DAY? >> MY WIFE AND I ARE HERE TODAY KILLED WERE FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY. BE SURE YOU GET UP THERE. >> THIS IS ONE OF CHASSE, A HOUSTON COURT FOR HIS WIFE FILMING A SHOW. >> RENOVATION PSYCHOLOGY, FOR STRESSES OF LIFE. >> VIEWERS ARE RIGHT. IF THEY CAN SURVIVE A RENOVATION, THEY ARE DOING RIGHT >> WHAT IS YOUR NAME? >> THANK YOU KATHY, I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT. >> I HAVE ONE QUESTION. THE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TAXATION. YOU REFER TO BASIC SERVICES OF GOVERNMENT. WHAT YOU SEE AS LEGITIMATE BASIC SERVICES AND GOVERNMENT? >> PROTECTING BORDERS, FIRE TRUCKS, TRASH, PULLIES CARS. >> WHICH YOU ARE SAYING IS GOVERNMENT SHRINKS DRASTICALLY. >> THE FAIR TAXES NOT DECIDE TO DO WITH THE ISSUE OF HOW WE SPEND THE MONEY AS TO HOW WE RECEIVE IT. A COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY OF EVERY TRANSACTION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGES IN IT IF YOU AS A CITIZEN WHEN TO BUY UP WITH THE WORK THING TO BUY A TOILET SEAT IN THE AIR FORCE, OR MOWING THE LAWN AT THE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE IN MANCHESTER, THE PEOPLE TO FIND THAT OUT AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNEW WHERE EVERY EXPENDITURE WENT IN WITH A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN STOPPING SOME OF THE CRAZIES THE. FEED WHAT WOULD YOU USE FOR A CRITERIA FOR GOVERNMENT SPENDING? >> I AM NOT SURE I FOLLOW THAT. FEED WHAT WOULD BE YOUR CRITERIA FOR GOVERNMENT SPENDING? >> I THINK ONLY THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE PRESERVED PROTECT OUR BASIC FREEDOMS. >> THOSE ARE BASICALLY SPELLED OUT IN OUR CONSTITUTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ILLEGITIMATE SPENDING GOING ON, WELFARE, DO YOU NAME IT. BUT UNLESS WE CAN WE DISTRIBUTE HOW WE GET OUR TAX MONEY, BUT THAT WILL ONLY LAST SO LONG UNTIL IT WILL BE BURDENED. BUT 23% AT THING HE SAID VERSES THE AVERAGE OF WHENEVER THE S BUT 23% SOUNDS PRETTY EXCESSIVE. MUCH HIGHER THAN THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT. >> PEOPLE -- EVERYTHING YOU BUY HAS 22% IN BEDDED TAXES. THE CORPORATIONS DON'T PAY TAXES EVERYTHING AND CORP. COLLECTS IN A TAX, IT PASSES ON IN THE COST OF THE PRODUCT IT AN AMERICAN PRODUCT, IF IT IS SOLD TO HAS AND EMBEDDED TEXT IF IT IS MADE IN EUROPE IT IS EXEMPT FROM THE DAT TAX ADDED YOUR SURF COMES TO THIS COUNTRY TAX-FREE. IT IS A RIDICULOUS SYSTEM AND NO WONDER WE ARE LOSING JOBS, BECAUSE WE ARE PUTTING AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN ON AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS AND WE'LL PUT ON THIS IMPORTANT THE GOOD TO US SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE ANY -- THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM AND GO TO SOMETHING THAT ELIMINATES THE NONSENSE WE HAVE AND CREATES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND WHAT IT WOULD DO WOULD BRING REALLY A TAX STRUCTURE THAT IS FAVORABLE TO THIS COUNTRY RATHER THAN EVER WERE BUT THIS COUNTRY. THEIR TAX THOUGHT OR IS THE WEBSITE YOU NEED TO GET PAID. >> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON SCHOOL CHOICE ISSUES LIKE THAT IS, TAX CREDITS, THINGS LIKE THAT? >> CAIRNES MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR KIDS' SCHOOLS MY KIDS ARE PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS. FIRST THROUGH 12TH GRADE, THAT WAS OUR CHOICE BUT I THINK PARENTS OUGHT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE DID PARENTS MAKING A CHOICE -- THE ONLY WAY THE BADGERS SYSTEM CAN BE APPROPRIATELY APPLIED IS A IT IS GIVEN IN SUCH WEIGHT THAT IF YOU ARE THE POOREST RANK YOU CAN ACCESS WHENEVER SCHOOL YOU WANT. WE DID DO A LOT OF THINGS IN ARKANSAS NOT ONLY TO MAKE HOMESCHOOLING EASIER BUT ALSO TO GIVE HOME SCHOOLED KIDS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. IT CREATES CHARTER SCHOOLS, COMPETITION AND OPEN UP THE WHOLE CHARTER SCHOOL OPTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT DOES HELP READ THAT. I AM NOT OPPOSED TO VOUCHERS --. >> TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE MEANS TESTING GOUGERS? >> WHEN THING WE DID DO, WE PASSED A LAW THAT CONSISTENTLY FAILS. THE STATE HAS A RIGHT TO GO IN BY SHUTTING IT DOWN, COMPLETELY CLOSING IT, TAKING OVER AND MAKING IT WORK. THANK YOU. >> I HELPED PASS A AMENDMENT IN ARKANSAS THAT SAYS IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE -- AND DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PRESERVE THAT LIKE IT I AM UNAPOLOGETIC IS. >> DO YOU THINK IT IS MURDER, ABORTION? >> HOW YOU DESCRIBE IT, IT IS THE TAKING OF AN INNOCENT HUMAN LIFE THAT IS NEVER BEEN ADJUDICATED, THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND I THINK IT IS A SIN. >> IT IS THOUGHT TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT? >> I SAID WHAT IT IS, IF YOU TAKE THE LIFE OF A PERSON THAT IS THAT ADJUDICATED, THAT IS CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT THE GUN AT THE RIGHT TO TAKE THE LIFE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN ADJUDICATED IS BE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT ROE V. WADE, WHAT CAN WE DO ONCE WE GET THESE BARRIERS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL DOWN? IF IT IS ABORTION OR TAKING A LIFE, IS THAT HOMICIDE. >> MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND ROE VERSES WADE. IT SAYS WE WILL CREATE A FEDERAL PROTECTION OF USING THE CLOAK OF PRIVACY. IF ROE VERSUS WADE IS OVERTURNED IT MEANS THE STATES MAKE THAT DECISION. ARKANSAS HAS MADE THAT DECISION OTHER STATES WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. >> WHAT DO THEY DO IN ARKANSAS -- IS IT ILLEGAL, ABORTION IS ILLEGAL IN ARKANSAS? >> BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL GRANT SYSTEM UNDER ROE VERSES WADE DECANT DISALLOW COMPLETELY. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE FETAL PROTECTION ACT. WE HAVE A PRINTING PERIOD COMEAU WE HAVE INFORMED CONSENT. THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS WE DO TO PROTECT LIFE. >> YELL THE CANDIDATE I'VE HEARD THAT AS A WILLINGNESS TO PROTECT THAT THE STATE LEVEL IS SENATOR BROWNBACK. >> HAS TALKED ABOUT IT, I PASSED ALL THOSE LAWS, NO OTHER DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN HAS DONE THAT. >> YOU ARE UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING AT THE STATE LEVEL TO FORCE PUNISHMENT OR PENALTY IS. >> I DID NOT SAY THAT. YOU ARE PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH. IN MY STATE I DID EVERY SINGLE THING WE COULD DO TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE. NO OTHER CANDIDATE HAS DONE THAT. >> AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE YOU ARE GOING TO -- THESE DAYS BUT UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE? >> ONCE AGAIN YOU ARE -- I THINK I'VE SPOKEN VERY CLEARLY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ROSEN -- ROE VERSES WADE OVERTURNED. I WISH EVERY STATE AND IN MY POSITION HAS BEEN SO OUTSPOKEN NO ONE WOULD DOUBT RIGHT AM ON THE POSITION. I AM NOT A RECENT CONVERT TO IT EITHER. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> NICE THING YOU AGAIN. >> THANK YOU. >> GOOD SEEING YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING APPLEGATE WE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH. >> THIS IS MY NEPHEW ERIC. >> NICE TO ME TO. >> LOOKING FOR IT TO THE SHOW. >> WHAT DO APPLY? >> QATAR, ACOUSTIC, IF LITTLE BIT ELECTRIC IT. >> IN-BAND? >> WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT? WE DO SOME MODERN ROCK. >> HE WILL BE A GOOD CRITIC OF US TONIGHT. DON'T WANT TO CLOSELY. THANK YOU, AND IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. HELLO, HELLO. THAT WILL GIVE YOU ONE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS. >> SOME FAMILIAR FACES. >> IT COULD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? I MISSED YOU SO MUCH WHEN I WAS UP THERE, WHERE WERE YOU? >> I WAS IN CALIFORNIA. >> FRANCE OR CALIFORNIA WITH QUALIFY AS AN EXCUSED ABSENCE. >> I WAS GOING TO BE THERE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I WAS IN LOS ANGELES. >> I WISH I COULD BE THERE IF NOTHING ELSE TO GO BACK TO BRAGGING RIGHTS AND SANG THE WINNERS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR ARE BACK IN PLEASE GIVE YOUR DAD MY REGARDS. >> I WILL, I WILL SAY HI. >> IF IT WERE FOR THE PRESS OF THE CAMPAIGN I WOULD SHOW UP. >> IT WILL BE GREAT THIS YEAR. >> LET'S HOPE THEY DON'T HAVE SNOW. >> WE HEARD THE STORY ON THE WAY UP. >> IN SEPTEMBER FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES. I WENT UP THERE THINKING IT WOULD BE 50 DEGREES. I WAS FREEZING TO DEATH. WE DON'T SEE SNOW IN JANUARY. THIS IS SEPTEMBER LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE GOT THERE AND THEY TELL ME, NO PROBLEM. WERE YOU ARE GOING YOU WILL GET ON AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING. THE GUY WITH ME, THE COAST GUARD GUY FROM ALASKA WITHIN -- THREE MINUTES IN SOME THING. >> HE WAS 168 SECONDS INTO HIS HUNT, HE TAKES HIS ANTELOPE SO HE IS FINISHED. THIS WAS AT 620 IN THE MORNING, AT 1:00 IN THE AFTERNOON WE HAD GONE ALL OVER CREATION AND WE SEE HIM 900 YARDS AWAY GOING 65 MILES AN HOUR. WE ARE NOT GETTING ANY CLOSER TO HIM. VOLUME IS COLD. I WANT TO END THIS PAIN DID FINALLY THERE IS ONE ACROSS THE BRIDGE, FROM MY SHOT IS A TRAJECTORY OF PREPARED THERE'S A 30-MILE AN HOUR WIND BLOWING. >> MY DAD SAYS IT IS ONE OF THE BEST SHOTS HE HAD EVER SEEN. >> I LEFT YOUR DAD. YOU CAN'T USE ANY ARTIFICIAL SUPPORT COMMUTE TO HOLD THE RIFLE. YOU CAN FEEL OR GET ON YOUR BELLY BUT YOU CAN'T USE ANYTHING ELSE. SO I WRAPPED THE STRAP, I SHOULD LEFT-HANDED, WRAPPED THE STRAP AROUND MY ARM. IF I AM NO WAY GOING TO TAKE THIS SHOT, 250 YEARS OUT OF THE RICH THAT I THOUGHT, IF I TAKE THE SHOT ANYWAY IT IS OVER, IT IS OVER BECAUSE YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT, SO I TAKE THE SHOT, IT IS OVER. IF I MISS, IT IS STILL OVER AND WE ARE OUT OF THERE. I LOOKED UP AND I SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. >> THE COAST GUARD GUY WAS REALLY GOOD AT IT. >> HE WAS, HE WAS ALL OVER IT. >> WE WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE. >> IT IS THE BIG BUTTON. >> I HOPE THIS WORKS. (music)(music) >> PROBABLY LEAVE IT ON. >> I WILL PROBABLY NEED ONE MORE ANYWAY.

A LITTLE MORE ENTHUSIASTICALLY. IT IS NOT GOING TO RAIN. SOME OF YOU DID NOT SAY IT WITH CONFIDENCE. IT IS NOT GOING TO RANK SAID IT WON'T HURT YOU THAT MUCH BUT WE ARE PLUGGED INTO ABOUT 30,000 VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY AND WE ARE ABOUT EXCITED ABOUT ANY RAIN SO IT IS UP TO YOU TO HOLD UP. IF IT DOES RANK, IT CAN ONLY GRANT OUT THERE.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?200216-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"INCLUDING A STOP AND YOU FORGOT. HERE ARE PART OF HER REMARKS. >> IN SOUTH CAROLINA, PROBABLY MORE THAN 25 YEARS AGO, LIKE I AM SURE MANY OF YOU CAME FOR THE VERY FIRST SIGN AS WELL AS MY HUSBAND AND MY DAUGHTER. WE WOULD DRIVE FROM LITTLE ROCK, OFTEN TO GO TO THE BEACHES, TO GO SCHRAM BING, TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCES THAT COME HERE IN THE LOW COUNTRY. AND OF COURSE FOR MANY YEARS I WENT TO HILTON TO RENAISSANCE WEEKEND. [APPLAUSE] AND I REMEMBERED SO WELL, WHEN THERE WAS NOT AS MUCH DEVELOPMENT, WHEN THERE WERE NOT AS MANY GOLF COURSES, NOT AS MANY HOMES AND OTHER AMENITIES AS THERE ARE TODAY. WE USED TO LAND, AS THEY DID TODAY COME IN SAVANNAH AND DRIVE AND SEE A LOT OF THESE SITES ALONG THE WAY. AND THERE ARE SO MANY WONDERFUL PERSONAL MEMORIES THAT I HAVE FROM ALL OF THOSE TRIPS TO THIS BEAUTIFUL STATE. I ALSO WAS VERY FORTUNATE AS A YOUNG WOMAN TO MEET SOMEONE WHO IS A NATIVE DAUGHTER OF SOUTH CAROLINA, WHO BECAME A REAL MENTOR FOR ME, AND THAT IS MARION WRIGHT EDELMAN FROM BENNETTSVILLE -- [APPLAUSE] YOU WENT TO SPELLMAN COLLEGE, THEN WENT TO YALE LAW SCHOOL AND BECAME THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN TO PASS THE BAR EXAM IN MISSISSIPPI AND WORKED ON BEHALF OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN MISSISSIPPI AND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH AND '60S. I WENT TO YALE LAW SCHOOL IN THEIR REMEMBER READING AN ARTICLE ABOUT THIS WOMAN NAMED MARION WRIGHT EDELMAN AND THINKING, WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON AND WITHIN DAYS I SAW SHE WAS GOING TO BE SPEAKING AT THE LAW SCHOOL, SO I WENT OVER TO HEAR HER STICK. AFTER LISTENING TO HER I WENT UP AND INTRODUCED MYSELF AND SAID, I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU. I WANT A SUMMER JOB IF I COULD. SHE SAID YOU CAN WORK FOR ME BUT I CAN PAY. I SAID THAT AS A PROBLEM BECAUSE I'M WORKING MY WAY THROUGH LAW SCHOOL. SHE SAID, I WILL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE PAID, I WILL GIVE YOU A JOB. I APPLIED FOR LAW STUDENTS CIVIL RIGHTS, WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET IT, WENT TO WORK FOR HER, AND HAVE BEEN SUCH A GREAT ADMIRER OF HER WORK FOR SO MANY YEARS. MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, I DID NOT WANT TO WORK FOR LAW FIRM, DID NOT WANT TO CLERK FOR A JUDGE. I WENT TO WORK FOR MERION AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND AND WE DID WORK IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH AND I HAD ONE OF THOSE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES THAT LIFE GIVES YOU. THE OTHER NIGHT IN WASHINGTON, I WAS PART OF A LARGE GROUP, AND MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD COME UP FROM BENNETTSVILLE AND MARLBORO COUNTY TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE THEY ARE NAMING THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR MERION. IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL, IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL STORY BECAUSE WHEN I USED TO LISTEN TO MERION TALK ABOUT GROWING UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, SHE COULD NOT GO TO THE LIBRARY WHEN SHE WAS GROWING UP. AND NOW THE LIBRARY WILL BE NAMED FOR HER. WHEN I THINK OF ALL THE WONDERFUL CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO YOUNG BUSH AND GIRLS WHO REALLY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO FULFILL THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL, IT FILLS ME WITH SUCH GRATITUDE FOR THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN OUR COUNTRY. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO, RAISED IN A SUBURB OF CHICAGO, I REALLY WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY COULD DO ANYTHING WE SET OUR MINDS TO. IF WE WERE THE BARRIER BREAKERS, WE HAVE HEARD THE PEOPLE WHO BRAVED WHAT EVER FRONTIER THERE WAS, WHETHER IT WAS THE WEST OR SPACE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. AND I BELIEVED THAT. AND IT WAS TRUE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. WHETHER IT WAS PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEND A MAN TO THE MOON AND BRING THEM BACK SAFELY BY THE END OF THE DECADE, I DID NOT KNOW HOW WE WOULD DO IT BUT I NEVER DOUBTED WE WOULD. THE PRESIDENT JOHNSON LOOKING STERNLY INTO THE TELEVISION CAMERA AND SAYING WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS. I KNEW IT WOULD BE HARD BUT IT WAS SOMETHING WE FACED UP TO AND BEGAN TO WORK ON. AND THAT IS HOW I THINK OF AMERICA. NOT JUST THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY, BUT A LAND OF THE BIG SCHOOLS, OF THE ADDITION, OF WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER COMING TO REALLY REALIZE OUR FOUNDING IDEALS. WE ARE BY NO MEANS PERFECT BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A COUNTRY LIKE OURS AND I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DREAM THAT HAS BEEN AMERICA STAYS ALIVE. AND WHEN I TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY I SOMETIMES ASK THEM, WHAT DO YOU THINK AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ARE TODAY? IT IS A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS IT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD? WHAT BARRIERS ARE WE BREAKING? WHAT FRONTIERS ARE WE EXPLORING? HOW DO WE DEFINE OUR MISSION AS A NATION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY? I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN SET BIG COOLS AGAIN. I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN LOOK BACK ON AND FEEL PRIDE IN WAS PRE LEWD, THAT THERE IS STILL SO MUCH TO BE DONE. WHEN I THINK OF TIMES OF LEADERSHIP IN AMERICA, IT IS NOT ONLY THE WARS THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM, IT IS NOT ONLY THE INVENTIONS THAT OUR SCIENTISTS HAVE COME UP WITH THAT HAVE IMPROVED LIFE, IT WAS THE COMMITMENT THAT WE WERE ON THIS JOURNEY TOGETHER. ABRAHAM LINCOLN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIVIL WAR, WHICH TORE OUR COUNTRY APART AS WE ALL KNOW, HE MADE TWO DECISIONS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT AS BEING SOMEWHAT AUDACIOUS, MAYBE EVEN UNREALISTIC. HE SAID WE ARE GOING TO FINISH AN INTERCONTINENTAL ROAD ROAD AND WE ARE GOING TO START BUILDING LAND GRANT COLLEGES, BECAUSE WE WANT TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT MODERN LEADERS TO FACED UP TO OUR DIFFICULT CHALLENGES, BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE, I CONSIDER MYSELF A PROGRESSIVE BECAUSE THAT IS ROOTED IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WHEN -- TEDDY ROOSEVELT WAS A GREAT PROGRESSIVE BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEVER GOT OUT OF BALANCE IN AMERICA, THAT WE DID NOT WANT TO LET ANYBODY GET IN AND MANAGE OVER ANYONE ELSE, WE ARE A MERITOCRACY, WE WANT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. WE DID THAT NOT WANT THE GOVERNMENT, WE DID NOT WANT BIG BUSINESS, WE WANTED TO KEEP THE DYNAMISM OF THE ECONOMY GOING. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WHO CAME IN AT A TIME WHEN OUR COUNTRY WAS FLAT ON ITS BACK, WHEN HE SAID ALL WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF, CONTRAST THAT WITH TODAY. WHEN I FEEL LIKE THE PRESIDENT WANTS THIS TO BE AFRAID. HE DOES NOT ONENESS TO STAND UP AND LOOK WITH CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT WE HAVE TO REMAYOR - MAKING IT THE AMERICAN SPIRIT. WE CANNOT LET IT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT AMERICA WILL REMAIN GREAT. THAT WE WILL REMAIN THE BEACON OF HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM. WE HAVE TO EVERY GENERATION RECOMMIT OURSELVES AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY, AND THIS PART OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS A -- [APPLAUSE] IS A CENTER FOR THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY IN SO MANY WHO HAVE ALREADY SERVED AND I SALUTE THEIR SERVICE AND THANK THEM FOR IT. BUT IT IS NOT JUST THOSE WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF OUR NATION, IT IS ALL OF US WHO MUST BE SUMMONED TO ANSWER THE CALL FOR WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE WANT. [APPLAUSE] I AM VERY WELL AWARE THAT IN RECENT ELECTIONS SOUTH CAROLINA HAS NOT EXACTLY BEEN IN THE DEMOCRATIC COLUMN. BUT I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON SOUTH CAROLINA. I AM GOING TO CAMPAIGN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND -- [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE AS A COUNTRY ARE NOT PARTISAN PROBLEMS. THERE'S NOT A DEMOCRATIC OR A REPUBLICAN SOLUTION THAT WILL WORK ONLY IN DEALING WITH ENERGY OR EDUCATION OR HEALTH CARE. WE NEED TO GET BACK TO MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON EVIDENCE, NOT IDEOLOGY. WE NEED TO TAKE OUT WHAT WILL WORK AND ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND THEN GET TOGETHER TO DO IT. I WANT TO END WITH THIS STORY BECAUSE IT SUMS UP FOR ME WHAT I HOPED TO DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT. IF GIVEN THE HONOR TO SERVE THE. IT IS A STORY TOLD TO ME BY MY FRIEND AND OUR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, MADELEINE ALBRIGHT. IN 1995 MADALEINE WAS ASKED TO GO TO EUROPE TO COMMEMORATE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II. AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW SHE WAS BORN IN THE FORMER CZECHOSLOVAKIA. HER FAMILY HAD TO CONTEND WITH NAZISM AND COMMUNISM. THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS REFUGEES, SAID SHE WAS HONORED AND PERSONALLY PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT OUR NATION. AS SHE TRAVELED AROUND, MOSTLY IN COUNTRIES THAT WERE BEHIND WHAT USED TO CALL THE IRON CURTAIN, SHE KEPT SAYING AMERICAN FLAGS EVERYWHERE. WHEN SHE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY SHE REALIZED THAT A LOT OF THOSE LEGS HAD ONLY 48 STARS. SHE STARTED ASKING PEOPLE, WHERE DID THIS FLAG COME FROM? EVERYONE TOLD HER THE SAME STORY THAT WHEN THE AMERICAN GIS LIBERATED EUROPE THEY PASSED OUT THESE FLAGS. REMEMBER BACK IN 1945 HAWAII AND ALASKA WERE NOT STATES GET. PEOPLE HAD KEPT THESE FLAGS LIKE FAMILY TREASURES, PASSING THEM DOWN FROM GRANDPARENTS TO PARENT TO CHILD, OFTEN AT GREAT RISK BECAUSE IF THE SOVIET OCCUPIERS HAD FOUND THEM WITH AN AMERICAN FLAG, THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE. MADALEINE ASK THEM, WHY DID YOU SAVE THESE FLAGS ALL THESE YEARS EVERYONE GAVE FOR THE SAME ANSWER. BECAUSE WE LOVE AMERICA AND BECAUSE WE LOVE AMERICA'S VALUES AND WE ALWAYS HOPED THAT ONE DAY BE WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE IN FREEDOM LIKE AMERICA. I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT WHO RESTORES THAT FEELING ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD AND EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY, I WANT THIS TO BELIEVE THAT ABOUT OURSELVES AGAIN. WE ARE A GOOD AND GREAT NATION AND WE CAN RENEW THE PROMISE OF AMERICA AND RESTORE AMERICA'S GREATNESS AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> THIS WEEK IN SENATOR CLINTON CAMPAIGNS IN CHICAGO INCLUDING A SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION, AN ANNUAL CONVENTION OF BLOGGERS.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?196631-1/clinton-campaign-town-hall-meeting,Clinton Campaign Town Hall Meeting,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"A PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE. SHE TOOK QUESTIONS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. THIS EVENT IS ABOUT AN HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES. >> WOW. THIS IS GREAT. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. ARE WE NOT PLEASED TO HAVE SENATOR CLINTON HERE WITH US TODAY? CLAUS >> IT IS SUCH A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE AND INTRODUCE THE SENATOR. I HAVE JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO SAY BECAUSE I KNOW HOW ANXIOUS YOU ALL ARE TO HEAR FROM THE SENATOR AND I AM AS WELL. YOU KNOW THAT TODAY TRULY IS HISTORICAL EVENT. WE HAVE WITH US A WOMAN WHO IS THE FRONT-RUNNER CANDIDATE FOR THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENCY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR MOTHERS AND THEIR MOTHERS FOUGHT HARD FOR THIS DAY AND WE ARE A WITNESS TO IT NOW. SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE AWARE THAT I WAS CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE, SO YOU KNOW THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. WE DO NOT HAVE A STRONGER ADVOCATE TODAY FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS THAN HILLARY CLINTON. SHE HAS SHOWN -- SHE HAS SHOWN THAT BY HER FIGHT FOR FUNDING, FOR RESEARCH, FOR BREAST CANCER, HER COMMITMENT TO WOMEN'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND CHOICE, AND SHE SPOKE -- AND WHEN SHE SPOKE AS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AND THE BEIJING KVENS ON WOMEN, SHE SPOKE FOR WOMEN ALL OVER THIS WORLD WHEN SHE SAID WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS KNOW THAT SENATOR CLPT HAS SAID IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD. AND SHE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS THAT IT TAKES A STRONG AND HEALTHY FAMILY TO CREATE A STRONG AND HEALTHY NATION. AND SHE HAS BEEN DOING THAT AND FIGHTING FOR US. IT TOOK INCREDIBLE COURAGE FOR HER TO SPEAK OUT ON THE COMPLEXITIES OF HEALTH CARE AND THE NECESSITY THAT WE ALL HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] SHE HAS BEEN STANDING UP FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE. [APPLAUSE] SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER AND PUSHING FOR A NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY AND EXPANDING RENEWABLE ENERGY SO THAT WE CAN STOP OUR DEPENDS ON THE MIDDLE EAST. [APPLAUSE] I HAD A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FEW MINUTES AND HAVE COFFEE AND IT WAS WONDERFUL. IT REALLY WANTED TO KNOW FROM THE SENATOR WHY SHE WANTS TO BE THE PRESIDENT? WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO HER AND SHE SAID WE CAN DO BETTER. AND SHE'S RIGHT. AND LASTLY, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS THE POWER OF DIPLOMACY AND SHE KNOWS THAT IT CAN WORK. IT WILL WORK. SHE CAN MAKE IT WORK. SHE'S COMMITTED TO MAKING THAT WORK. IT MUST BE CENTRAL TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR EVERYONE HERE WELCOMES YOU. OPENS THEIR ARMS AN EMBRACES YOU. IT IS WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE. PERSONALLY, IT IS AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE A GREAT UNITED STATES SENATOR AND A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU ALL FOR ELECTING MOLLY KELLY TO THE STATE SENATE. I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE AND VERY, VERY HONORED TO BE INTRODUCED BY SENATOR KELLY. I KNOW THAT THERE'S ANOTHER KELLY BY THE NAME OF PATRICK WHO IS DOING QUITE WELL FOR THE BASKETBALL TEAM HERE. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IN THIS COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN AND THE STUDENTS BECAUSE I HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF KEENE. GOING BACK TO 1991 AND 192. THE FIRST TIME I CAME HERE WAS IN OCTOBER OF 1991. IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE HOL WEAN. IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY. WHICH IS IN LATE OCTOBER. AND THE ENTIRE TOWN WAS DECORATED FOR WHAT LO WEAN. AND I WAS SO TOUCH BY HOW ENTHUSIASTICALLY PEOPLE ASKED ME IF I COULD SEE THE CHILDREN IN THEIR COSTUMES. IT WAS SUCH A BIG PART OF COMMUNITY SPIRIT. WE HAD SO MANY VISITS TO THIS TOWN. AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN OPENED THEIR ARMS TO BILLION AND TO ME AND OPENED THE DOORS OF SO MANY HOMES AND THE COLLEGE, WHICH SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ON A VERY COAL DAY PEOPLE WERE STANDING IN LINE FOR HOURS AT THE COLLEGE. AND OFTENTIMES WHEN WE REMINISCE ABOUT THE CAM TAIN IN NATCH, BILL OFTEN SLEEPS ABOUT THE GREAT SUPPORT THAT HE RECEIVED RIGHT HERE IN THIS TOWN. I'M HERE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN DO BETTER. WE CAN DO BETTER AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] AND I WANTED TO BRING MY CAMPAIGN ON ITS VERY FIRST WEEKEND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO KEENE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO TURN OUR COUNTRY AROUND. YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN TO A MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S TRUE. BUT I WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY WITH A FATHER WHO WAS A WORLD WAR II VET WHO CAME BACK AND STARTED TO GET TO WORK TO BUILD A SMALL BUSINESS TO SUPPORT MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS AND ME. TO A MOTHER WHO DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GO TO COLLEGE, BUT WHO BELIEVED STRONGLY IN EDUCATION. AND THOUGHT THAT HER DAUGHTER COULD GO AS FAR AS I WISHED IF I WORKED HARD AND GOT THAT GOOD EDUCATION. AND YET, I KNOW THAT IT WASN'T JUST MY FAMILY THAT SHAPED ME BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE AS MOLLY SAID, THAT IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD. SO I HAD TEACHERS WHO MADE A BIG IMPRESSION ON ME AND SET ME ON A COURSE TO WHERE I AM TODAY. I HAD A PEDIATRICIAN HO IN THOSE DAYS ACTUALLY MADE HOUSE CALLS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE H.M.O. WOULD SAY IF THEY WENT TO SEE ONE OF THEIR LITTLE PATIENTS. I HAD NEIGHBORS WHO KEPT A WATCH OUT FOR US. I REMEMBER ONE DAY WHEN MY GRANDFATHER CAME TO THE HOUSE IN AN UNFAMILIAR CAR AND THE WOMAN ACROSS THE STREET WAS OUT THE DOOR BECAUSE WE WERE PLAYING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND SHE WASN'T SURE WHO THAT STRANGE CAR BELONGED TO. I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR WHO GAVE ME CONFIDENCE AND A POLICE CHIEF IN MYSELF, BUT WHO ALSO WERE PART OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY THAT WE CHERISH. WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BLESSINGS WE ENJOYED WERE NOT ONES OF OUR OWN MAKING. BUT WE HADEN HEARTED THEM. THAT IS THE JOB OF EACH GENERATION. TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY AND OUR WORLD BETTER OFF THAN HOW WE FOUND IT. AND I WORRY TODAY, THAT WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF SEEING A REVERSAL IN THAT FORWARD MOVEMENT OF AMERICAN PROGRESS. WE KNOW THAT HERE AT HOME, THINGS ARE NOT ADDING UP, ARE THEY? >> WE HAVE GOT CORPORATE PROFITS UP. C.E.O. PAY IS UP OUTRAGEOUSLY, PRODUCTIVITY IS UP WHICH MEANS AMERICAN WORKERS ARE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER. THEY WORK HARDER THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. AND YET NICKS AREN'T UP. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN, SOMETIMES TWO PARENTS IN A FAMILY, SOMETIMES ONLY A SINGLE PARENT. AND THEY'RE JUST RUNNING IN PLACE AND EVEN FEELING AS THOUGH THEY'RE FALLING BACKWARDS. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE UP. EDUCATION COSTS ARE UP. ENERGY COSTS ARE UP. AND THERE'S A SENSE THAT SOMEHOW THAT BASIC BARGAIN THAT SO MANY OF US COUNTED ON IS NOT BEING HELD UP. THAT WE'RE DOING OUR POORT. I MEET PEOPLE ALL THE TIME WHO LITERALLY CANNOT WORK ANY HARDER THAN THEY'RE WORKING WHEN I WAS IN IOWA TWO WEEKS AGO I MET A YOUNG ENGINEER WHO SAID, I DID WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. I WAS THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. I GOT AN ENGINEERING DEGREE. I GOT A GOOD JOB AND NOW I'M BEING ASKED TO TRAIN MY SUCCESSOR BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING OUR JOBS TO INDIA. WE HAVE A SENSE THAT THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ON OUR SIDE IS MISSING IN ACTION. IT'S NOT ON OUR SIDE. [APPLAUSE] AND PART OF THAT BASIC BARGAIN, YOU KNOW IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU PLAY BY THE RULE, YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER FUTURE FOR QUOURS AND YOUR CHILDREN, THAT ASSUMED THAT WE WOULD HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT DIDN'T TILT THE ODDS AGAINST US. THAT WAS THERE FOR US. THAT WOULD TAKE ON THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT NONE OF US ALONE COULD DO. OR THAT NO STATE OR COMMUNITY COULD DO ON ITS OWN. BUT THAT ISN'T HAPPENING TODAY. WE FACE SERIOUS PROBLEMS HERE AT HOME THAT WE ARE IGNORING OR DENYING. NOW MOLLY SAID THAT I HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT HEALTH CARE A FEW YEARS AGO, AND SOME OF YOU REMEMBER. AND IT WAS A VERY -- [APPLAUSE] IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN, WHICH I DIDN'T DO VERY WELL, BUT WE TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHY WE NEEDED TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS HEALTH CARE ISSUE. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME THAT WE WERE TRYING, BILL AND I, TO GET HEALTH CARE FOR THE MILLIONS OF UNSHURD AND WE WERE. BUT WE WERE ALSO TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT KEPT PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE TO EVERY MORE THAN. WELL NOW, 14 YEARS LATER, YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE HAVE EVEN MORE UNSURED PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE INSURED EXCEPT WHEN THEY NEED THE INSURANCE TO PAY FOR A TREATMENT OR A DRUG OR SOME OTHER HELP THAT THEY REQUIRE. SO PART OF MY CAMPAIGN IS TO CREATE THE CONSENSUS THAT WOULD GET US TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE CONCH DURING MY TERM AS PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE OR DEPENDS ON FOREIGN OIL, SOMETHING EL MOLLY TALKED ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE PUT AT DANGER EVERY DAY BECAUSE WE WILL NOT DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MOVE TOWARD ENERGY SECURITY AND LESSEN OUR DEPENDS ON FOREIGN OIL. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE WE CAN DO THIS. AND AT THE SAME TIME IT WILL NOT ONLY BE GOOD FOR OUR SCOORT, IT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT, AND IT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY. BECAUSE I THINK THAT IF WE SET FORTH AN AGENDA OF ENERGY SECURITY AND INDEPENDENCE WE WILL BE ABLE FINALLY TO BEGIN DEALING WITH GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, SOMETHING THAT NO MATTER HOW OFTEN SOME PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON TRY TO DENY IT A REALITY AND A CRISIS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH. AND WE WILL BE ABLE WE WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE NEW JOBS. I THINK THERE WILL BE THOUSANDS OF GOOD, HIGH-PAYING JOBS IN A NEW ENERGY AGENDA. A NEW EMERGENCY FUTURE THAT EVERYTHING [APPLAUSE] EVERYTHING FROM POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGY TO NEW BIOMASS AND ETHANOL PLANTS THAT USE ALL KINDS OF MATERIALS TO NEW WAYS OF PRODUCING ELECTRICITY. WE HAVE TO HAVE LEADERSHIP, STRONG LEADERSHIP AN SMART SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PUSH [APPLAUSE] I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO DOING FOR MORE OUR CHILDREN. PARTICULARLY POOR AND DISADVANTAGEDS KIDS, BUT REALLY ALL KIDS. AND WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO CREATE IS CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH TEACHERS CAN TEACH AND CHILDREN CAN LEARN. AND THAT REQUIRES -- PLAU THAT REQUIRES EVERYTHING FROM INVESTING IN PRECOOL EDUCATION, WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE FOR THE FUTURE. TO TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THE FEDERAL MANDATES FOR NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND TO TRY TO GET SOME CHANGES MADE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR THE AVERAGE STUDENT. [APPLAUSE] IT IS SO DISHEARTENING TO ME THAT IT IS NOW MORE COSTLY FOR THE AVERAGE MIDDLE INCOME OR LOWER INCOME FAMILY TO AFFORD TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO COLLEGE THAN IT WAS 30 YEARS AGO. BECAUSE COLLEGE TUITION HAS GONE UP TWO AND THREE TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION FOR 30 YEARS. SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS GET SERIOUS ABOUT HELPING FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AFFORD TO START COLLEGE, CONTINUE COLLEGE, AND COMPLETE COLLEGE WITHOUT COMING OUT WITH A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT THAT WILL BURDEN THEM AND PREVENT THEM PERHAPS FROM PURSUING A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE OR AN EDUCATION, OR IN NURSING OR IN AN AREA THAT WE NEED HELP IN LIKE MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE. SO WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT HOW WE FINANCE COLLEGE. THERE'S A LOT WE NEED TO DO AT HOME. I HOPE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS YOU ASK YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO FACE UP TO THE FACT THAT THE LAST SIX YEARS HAVE CREATED A WORLD THAT DOESN'T RESPECT US, DOESN'T LIKE US, DOESN'T WANT TO WORK WITH US. AND WE CANNOT AFFORD THAT. IN ADDITION TO THE VERY REAL THREATS THAT SOME OF THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR ALLIES POSE TO US, WE HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AS A WORLD TO CONFRONT. AND I THINK THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT'S REFUSAL TO ENGAGE IN DIPLOMACY EFFECTIVE, PATIENT, SMART DIPLOMACY HAS BEEN A TRAGIC MISTAKE. [APPLAUSE] >> WE HAVE THE HEARTBREAKING DILEMMA CONFRONTING US IN ROOK. AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT'S RECENT STRATEGY OF ESCALATION CANNOT BRING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE AND THE SECTARIAN DIVIDES. I AM AGAINST THIS ESCALATION STRATEGY AND AM WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- [APPLAUSE] TO TRY TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PUSHING THE PRESIDENT TO REVERSE COURSE. BUT WE NEED HELP BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE AND THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEBATE THE DIRECTION THAT THIS PRESIDENT IS TAKING US. WE NEED YOUR HELP AND THE HELP OF COUNTLESS AMERICANS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY TO SEND A CLEAR UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE TO THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE AND TO THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS AND TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO LET US DEBATE THE FUTURE DIRECTION IN IRAQ AND TO CHANGE COURSE BEFORE WE LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW THERE ARE SO MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES TO TALK ABOUT. BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME WHO MIGHT THINK OR EVEN SAY THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT SURE ABOUT A WOMAN PRESIDENT. WELL, I SAY WE WILL NEVER KNOW UNTIL WE TRY. [APPLAUSE] AND I AM VERY PROUD TO BE A WOMAN. MOLLY AND I HAD A FEW MINUTE TOGETHER BEFORE WE CAME IN AND WE IMMEDIATELY STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR CHILDREN. AND I KNOW THIS MY EXPERIENCES IN LIFE ARE ONES THAT GIVE ME THE FULL SET OF QUALIFICATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT I WILL TAKE INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. BUT I AM NOT RUNNING AS A WOMAN. I AM RUNNING BECAUSE I BELIEVE I AM THE PERSON BEST QUALIFIED TO TAKE OBJECT RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADING OUR COUNTRY IN JANUARY 2009. [APPLAUSE] AND SO, I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN KEENE. I AM KEEN ON KEENE. AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION THAT I'M STARTING WITH THE VOTERS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I SO RESPECT THE PROCESS THAT YOU HOLD FOR OUR COUNTRY EVERY FOUR YEARS. BECAUSE IT IS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE A CHANCE OUTSIDE THE USUAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND THE FLYING FROM AIRPORT TO PARENT TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT FOR AMERICA. I THINK THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO BEGIN TO CHOOSE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. SO LET US BEGIN THE CONVERSATION RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I WILL. I WILL. LET'S SEE, WE'VE GOT THIS GENTLEMAN. HE'S ALL READY. YES, SIR? >> [INAUDIBLE] -- I WANT TO TELL YOU ALL HERE IN THE AUDIENCE EVERYBODY FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT YOU MAY THINK THAT NEW YORK IS A BLUE STATE, NEW YORK CITY IS BLUE. BUT MOST OF NEW YORK IS CONSERVATIVE AND REPUBLICAN. I GREW UP AND WORKED IN SU FOLK COUNTY. THEY WERE VERY AGAINST YOU. YOU WERE CALLED EVERYTHING. >> TRUE. >> AND I NEVER FORGET AND PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT POLITICAL AND ALMOST INTIMIDATED THE WAY THEY WANTED YOU TO SIGN SOMETHING AND YOU STUCK UP AND YOU PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE AND YOU WON THE ELECTION BECAUSE OF THAT. AND SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE NIGHT THAT YOU COULDN'T WIN O OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. YOU WON IN THE LAST ELECTION IN NEW YORK. IN EVERY BUT FOUR COUNTRIES WHAT NASSAU COUNTY WAS OVER 30 YEARS CONSERVATIVE, REPUBLICAN CONTROL. SO YOU CAN. AND I CAN THAT NOW. [LAUGHTER] THE OTHER THING IS THAT I HEARD OVER THE YEARS AND I REALLY WISH -- I FIND MYSELF I'M A POLITICAL JUNKY. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU TRY TO GET THE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. AN YOU FAILED, BUT AT LEAST YOU TRIED. IT SEEMS THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE DEFENSIVE WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU, THEY SAY HILLARY CARE FAILED. YOU DIDN'T FAIL. YOU TRIED. WE NEED UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. IT IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE FOR ME AN MY OWN LIFE. TO COME TO A NEW STATE COMING TO A NEW STATE COGIVING UP A JOB WITH HEALTH CARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST SITUATIONS WAS WHETHER OR NOT I COULD MOVE -- MY QUESTION IS OK. WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE A PLEDGE AND ASK YOUR OTHER DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS TO DO WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID AND SAY, 13TH AMENDMENT, I WILL NOT PUT DOWN MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS? >> YES. >> WE WANT THAT BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO DISINGENUOUS WHEN ONE MOMENT YOU'RE PUTTING EACH OTHER DOWN AND THE NEXT MOMENT YOU'RE ARM IS AROUND. SO PLEASE MAKE THAT PLEDGE. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, I THANK YOU FOR -- THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I THANK YOU FOR THOSE KIND WORDS. I'M SO PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT NEW YORK AND IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS SIX QUEERS. I WAS ABLE TO GAIN AND SUPPORT AND HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTE FOR ME WHO BELIEVE ME NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD AND I'LL THRILLED BY THAT. I WANT TO RUN A CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE FUTURE AND ABOUT THE ISSUES. AND WHAT I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE VOTERS TO SORT OUT ANY DIFFERENCES AMONG US. I WANT TO BE POSITIVE AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE AS I DO, THAT WE CAN DO BETTER, WE SHOULD START BY DONING BETTER IN THE CAME PAIN TO LAY THE GROUND WORK ONCE WE TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE. >> I LIKE EVERYTHING YOU SAID SO FAR. EXCEPT I'M A LIL UNEASY ABOUT THE INCREMENTALISM. I BELIEVE WE'RE AT A TIME WE NEED BOLD SLOUGSES AND THIS IS IT IF IT EVER WAS. AAM FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. I THINK WE NEED FREE COLLEGE. THIS IS A TIME WHEN COLLEGE IS LIKE WHAT HIGH SCHOOL USED TO BE. WE NEED FREE COLLEGE. AND REALLY BOLD PROGRAMS AND PEOPLE SAY WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT? AND I DON'T CARE. I THINK WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. WE WENT INTO THIS WAR. AND WE'RE PAYING FOR IT. AND WE CAN PAY FOR THE THINGS THAT WE NEED AT HOME. I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. >> THAT'S GREAT. [APPLAUSE] WELL, I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE TO BE BOLD. WE NEED STRONG LEADERSHIP AND SMART SOLUTIONS. WE NEED TO START COMING FORWARD WITH THE IDEAS WE THINK WE CAN TRANSLATE INTO ACTION. AND UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IS THAT GOAL. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO GET THERE. AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THE CAMPAIGN IS TO TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET THERE BECAUSE I FOUND OUT THAT PEOPLE CAN BE ALL IN FAVOR OF THE GOAL, BUT WHEN THE SPECIAL INTEREST GET ORGANIZED AND HEN THEY START SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO TELL YOU THAT WHAT YOU THINK YOU WANT, NAMELY UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE REALLY ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT FOR THE FOLLOWING 25 REASONS, PEOPLE START TO GET A LITTLE NERVOUS. AND BEGIN TO WONDER ABOUT IT. SO WE'VE GOT A HAVE A VERY STRONG BASE OF SUPPORT. THE OTHER THING WE NEED IS WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE AS WE STARTED IN THE 2006 ELECTION TO ELECT DEMOCRATS TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS SO WE GET AN EVEN BIGGER MAJORITY TO TAKE THE ACTION THAT WE NEED. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS ALWAYS THE HARD PART. THERE ARE SO MANY HANDS. >> I HAVE A SERIOUS QUESTION. I HAVE A SERIOUS QUESTION TO ASK YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WEAR BOXERS OR BRIEFS. THAT WAS ON OLD BILL CLINTON QUESTION. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? VERY CLEARSLY. WHAT THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION THEY SEEM O LOOK DOWN UPON THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE. WE HAVE A TAX TRUCKTURE THAT FAVOR IT IS RICH. IT'S A POLICY THAT I CALL NO MILLIONAIRE LEFT BEHIND. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT HOW ARE WE GOING TO CHANGE THAT STRUCK WHICH ARE AND WHAT'S IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE? >> IT'S GOING TO START BY TAKE GETTING BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY WHICH WE HAD WHEN THIS PRESIDENT CAME INTO OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO CHANGE THE PRIORITY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THEY'RE TWO BIGGEST PRIORITY ARE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS AND WAGING THIS WAR WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT. WE'VE NEVER HAD A PRESIDENT WHO TOOK US TO WAR AND DIDN'T PAY FOR IT. SO THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT IS BACK IN A WAY THAT PORTENDS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE ROAD. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET BACK TO WHAT WORKED IN THE PAST. THIS COUNTRY'S BEEN GREAT A VERY LONG TIME. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET BACK TO HAVING THE VERY RICH PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP THE PEOPLE ON THE BOTTOM GET OUT OF POVERTY AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. THAT'S WHY MOVING FORWARDS UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE. MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. FORGIVING THE LOANS AND THE COSTS FOR PEOPLE WHO GO INTO CERTAIN SERVICE CAREERS. . >> THE WOMAN RIGHT HERE. THAT'S OK. IT'S COMING TO YOU. HERE IT IS. >> THANK YOU, MRS. CLINTON FOR COMING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. I'M A DEMOCRAT AND I LIKE SO MUCH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW, THOUGH, THAT I'M AGAINST THE WAR. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I GOT A THREE-PAGE LETTER FROM YOU, I GOT IT LAST WEEK, AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION IRAQ ONCE. AND I'M REALLY, REALLY GLAD THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY AND I WANT TO YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE LEAD IN STOPPING THIS WAR AND ENDING IT. AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE LEAD IN BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME. AND I WANT YOU TO PLEDGE TO US THAT YOU WILL DO THAT. >> WELL, LET ME ANSWER THAT, BECAUSE I SHARE THE SENSE OF ANGER AND OUTRAGE AND JUST DEEP, DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN IRAQ. AND WE HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY UNTIL NOW WITH A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS COMING IN TO REALLY GET THEM TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT. THIS CONGRESS, UNDER REPUBLICANS, ADVOCATED THEIR -- ABDICATED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT SCOMMEARGS HOLD THE PRESIDENT'S ACCOUNTABLE. THEY DIDN'T LOOK INTO THE EVIDENCE WE HAD OF CRUMBS BY WAR PROFITEERS. THEY TURNED A DEAF EAR AND A BLIND EYE TO WHAT WAS GOING ON RIGHT BEFORE EMP'S FACE WHAT WE COULD SEE OURSELVES. THEY WOULDN'T HOLD THESE HEARINGS AND THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO REALLY HELP MOVE THE PRESIDENT IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WE'VE HAD A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS FOR A MONTH AND WE ARE TRYING TO GATE BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL AGAINST THE PRESIDENT'S ESCALATION STRATEGY. I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BECAUSE WE IN THE SENATE -- AND THIS IS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WONDER ABOUT BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM FRUSTRATING -- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET 60 VOTES TO PASS ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE RULES IN THE SENATE. TO GET A MAJORITY OF THE SENATE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY WOULD SEND A VERY STRONG MESSAGE. THOSE WHO SAY IT'S A NONBINDING RESOLUTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN, ALL I CAN TELL AS YOU THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS WORKING VERY HARD TO DEFEAT IT. THEY HAD ALL OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO DINNER AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST FRIDAY TO PERSUADE THEM TO DO WHAT THEY DID THIS WEEK, INCLUDING YOUR TWO SENATORS, WHICH WAS TO AVOID HAVING A DEBATE AND A VOTE ON THIS POLICY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF WE GET THE VOTE, WE WILL PASS A STRONG RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. NOW, I WANTING TO FARTHER. I HAVE LEGISLATION TO PASS THE NUMBER OF TROOPS BECAUSE I THINK IF WE COULD PASS THE TROOPS AT THE LEVEL OF JANUARY 1, BEFORE THE ESCALATION, THAT WOULD REIN THE PRESIDENT IN. IN ORDER FOR ME TO GET MY LEGISLATION PASSED TOUGH GET OVER THAT 60-VOTE HURDLE. AND I KNOW THAT IS HARD MEDICINE FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY JUST DO SOMETHING. IN ORDER TO DO SOMETHING, WE'VE GOT TO HAVE REPUBLICANS TO HELP US AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS OF 2008 WHEN WE'LL HAVE 60 DEMOCRATS, I HOPE, AND WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> NOW, I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL LET YOUR VOICES BE HEARD TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO LET US VOTE. THIS IS A DEMOCRACY. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE ON PEOPLE'S MINDS. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING FORWARD WITH HIS ESCALATION PLANS. WE HAVE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE BEING SENT OVER THERE AS WE SPEAK. AND IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO PERSUADE THIS PRESIDENT TO CHANGE COURSE. THAT IS JUST THE REALITY IN DEALING WITH HIM. BUT ONE WAY TO GET HIS ATTENTION IS BY HAVING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS SAY THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO VOTE FOR ANOTHER REPUBLICAN UNLESS THIS REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT BEGINS TO EXTRICATE US FROM IRAQ RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] >> I CAN HEAR YOU. >> WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE, YOU NO WHAT I MEAN, IF THAT COUNTRY IS IN CHAOS RIGHT NOW. SO I WANT TO KNOW YOUR PLANS FOR GETTING TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ BUT GETTING THAT COUNTRY OUT OF THE CHAOS IT IS IN TODAY. >> HERE'S WHAT I WISH THE PRESIDENT WOULD DO NOW BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO LOSE TWO YEARS IF WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I DO IT WHEN I'M PRESIDENT. I WILL DO IT WHEN I'M PRESIDENT BUT I WISH THAT WE COULD PERSUADE HIM TO BEGIN TO DO WHAT SHUCK DONE NOW. HERE IS WHAT I WOULD WANT HIM TO DO RIGHT NOW. NUMBER ONE, HE HAS AVOIDED REALLY REJECTED DIPLOMACY. AND HE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONVENE AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE THAT INCLUDES THE NEIGHBORS OF IRAQ AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A STAKE IN THE FUTURE STABILITY OF IRAQ. [APPLAUSE] >> AND IT SHOULD BE BOTH A VERY PUBLIC GATHERING OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PARTIES AND OF COURSE BEHIND THE SCENES PRESSURE BECAUSE MANY OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT IRAN. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IRAN WILL DO, THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IRAN GETTING NUCLEAR WEAPONRY SO THEY HAVE A STAKE IN TRYING TO STABILIZE IRAQ IN ORDER TO PREVENT IRAN FROM HAVING TOO MUCH INFLUENCE IN IRAQ. SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING, I WOULD PUT THE VERY BEST DIM-R DIP LOMENTS WE HAVE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHETHER THEY ARE ACTIVE OR RETIRED. THAT'S WHAT BILL ALWAYS DID, HE ALWAYS REACHED OUT TO PEOPLE WHO COULD TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE AND COULD PATIENTLY LISTEN. IT TAKES TIME TO CHANGE THESE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. YOU KNOW, ONE THAT COMES TO MIND IMMEDIATELY, AND SOME OF YOU, I KNOW, FOLLOW THIS, IT WAS 14 YEARS AGO THAT BILL GAVE JERRY ADAMS A VISA TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES AND WE STARTED THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS. IT WAS LAST WEEK THAT THEY DECIDED, VOTED TO JOIN THE POLICING OF NORTHERN IRELAND IT. TAKES TIME TO UNLOCK THESE VERY HEART FELT DEALINGS THAT GO BACK CENTURIES AND SO LET'S START THE DIPLOMATIC PROS AND HE IS LET'S BEGIN TO TRY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN MAKE HAPPEN. SECONDLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT A BLANK CHECK. THEY HAVE BASICALLY BEEN TOLD YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THESE THINGS LIKE COME UP WITH HOW YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOCATE THE OIL REVENUES, REVERSE DID HE BATHFICATION, AMEND THE CONSTITUTION WHICH YOU SAID YOU WOULD DO AND YOU HAVEN'T, BUT THERE ARE NEVER ANY CONSEQUENCES WHEN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. IN ADDITION TO WHAT I WANT TO DO, ANOTHER PART OF MY PROPOSAL IS TO THREAT TONE CUT THE FUNDING OF THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES AND THE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS WHO GUARD THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT UNLESS THEY BEGIN TO TAKE THE STEP THEY HAVE PROMISED TO TAKE. THAT IS HOW I THINK YOU GET THEIR ATTENTION. WE NEED NOT JUST A POLICY OF TO GET THEM TO DEAL WITH THE INTERNAL POLITICAL PROBLEMS THAT THEY FACE. AND FINALLY, I WOULD BEGIN TO REDEPLOY OUR TROOPS. I HAVE SAID THAT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. I HAVE VOTED FOR IT TWICE. BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU, THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN CONTINUING, VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS WE HAVE IN IRAQ. AND SOME OF YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH THAT BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST TO SEND OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN INTO COMBAT SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS SHOOTING AT THEM, WHERE THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF SECTARIAN WARFARE THAT THEY DOPT UNDERSTAND BEING CONDUCTED IN A LANGUAGE THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE PERSON THAT IS THEIR ALLY TODAY WILL BE SHOOTING AT THEM TOMORROW. SO I WOULD TAKE OUR TROOPS OUT OF THAT. WE WILL NOT BE THERE TO BABYSIT THIS MULTIPRONGED CIVIL WARMENT THEY HAVE TO DECIDE THEY SAID TO END THE SECTARIAN VIOLENCE. HOWEVER -- [APPLAUSE] >> HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN PREVENTING AL QAEDA, WHICH IS NOW IN IRAQ -- IT WAS NOT IN IRAQ, YOU KNOW, WHEN VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY KEPT TELLING US THAT, I DON'T KNOW WHO HE THOUGHT WOULD BELIEVE THAT BUT IT WAS NOT TRUE. THEY'RE IN IRAQ NOW. AND THEY CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE OVER AL-ANBAR PROVINCE, WHICH IS WHERE THEY STAGE MOST OF THEIR INSURGENT ATTACKS FROM, BECAUSE IF THEY WERE TO GAIN THAT FOOT HOLD THAT TERRITORIAL BASE, IT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT AFTER FAILED STATE FROM WHICH THEY THEN COULD LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST OUR ALLIES, AGAINST AMERICAN INTEREST. SO WE DO HAVE A CONTINUING MILITARY MISSION AGAINST THE AL QAEDA SNURNTS. WE ALSO HAVE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO SPOFERTE THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES IF THEY DO STAND UP AND FIGHT. I MEAN, IF THEY WILL DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES THEY'RE TWOILING STAND THEIR GROUND AND TAKE ON THE SNUNCHTS AND THE DEATH SQUADS, THEN I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM SOME AIR COVER AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM SOME LOGISTICAL SUPPORT. BUT THAT'S A STRANGE AND MORTE SUPPORT MISSION. THAT'S NOT AMERICAN FORCES BEING IN THE BATTLE, ON THE GROUND. AND FINALLY, I THINK WE DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE KURDS. THE KURDS HAVE TRIED, IN THE NORTH OF IRAQ, TO BASICALLY GET ON WITH LIFE AND HAVE A FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE TO BE MIND IF YOU FEEL OFFUL OF THAT. AND I GUESS -- MINDFUL OF THAT. AND I GUESS I WOULD ADD IF IRAN WERE TO CROSS THE BORDER, WE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THAT. BECAUSE THERE IS A FEAR IT COULD LEAD TO A REGIONAL CONFLAGRATION ABOUT IRAN AND SO WE HAVE TO BE IN THE FOREFRONT OF TRYING TO GET THE OTHER COUNTRIES TO HELP US CONTAIN AND DETER IRAN. SO -- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN -- WE DON'T NEED MANY TROOPS FOR THOSE MISSIONS BUT THAT'S HOW I WOULD TRY TO DO FORWARD WITH IT. [APPLAUSE] >> OK. I SEE A HAND RIGHT THERE. YES. I CAN PROBABLY HEAR YOU BUT -- THERE YOU GO. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, SENATOR, FOR COMING. I'VE BEEN IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION FOR OVER 30 YEARS. I CAN'T WAIT TO RETIRE. NOT BECAUSE OF MY AGE BECAUSE WE SHARE A BIRTHDAY. >> YOUNG. >> RIGHT. BUT BECAUSE OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE STRESSING OUT OUR KIDS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. NOT THE MANDATES SO MUCH, BUT HOW DO WE GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF TEACHING AND NOT TESTING? >> RIGHT, RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] >> YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE OF THE BIG SURPRISES FOR THE NATIONAL PRESS WHEN THEY FOLLOWED ME TO IOWA IS THAT I GOT MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND THAN ABOUT IRAQ OR ANYTHING ELSE. AND IT WAS IN EVERY AUDIENCE I WAS IN, BIG AND SMALL. AND IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL THERE'S SOMETHING AMISS, THERE'S SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL WRONG WITH WHAT WE ARE DOING TO THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. NOW, I BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK MOST EDUCATORS DO. PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW, ARE KIDS LEARNING? AND IF THEY'RE NOT LEARNING SH WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER TO HELP THEM LEARN? ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND IS THAT THE TESTS HAVE BECOME THE ENTIRE DEFINITION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS AND THEY'RE VERY OFTEN SOMEWHAT ADD ODDS WITH WHAT MANY EDUCATORS THINK SHOULD BE WHAT CHILDREN ARE LEARNING AND BE A SOSHING AND WHETHER THEY ARE ENJOYING THE PROCESS OF BECOMING SBE LUCK ACTUALLY CURIOUS AND ALIVE. SO I THINK WE'VE GOT TO SORT OF SHIFT THE FOCUS BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED -- AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND EFFORT EVEN MORE TROUBLING, IS THAT A LOT OF STATES HAVE GIVEN TESTS -- THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE RESULTS, SO THEY CHANGED THE TESTS, THEY'VE LOWERED THE STANDARDS. SO IT'S JUST A GAME THAT'S GOING ON. BUT THE KIDS ARE STILL TAKING ALL OF THESE TESTS. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DO -- AND WE'RE ABOUT TO BEGIN THIS DEBATE AND I'LL HAVE A BETTER IDEA HOW IT PROCEEDS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS GET A LOT OF ADVICE FROM EXPERIENCED EDUCATORS ABOUT HOW WE MEET THE GOALS OF ACCOUNTABILITY, BECAUSE PEOPLE, TAXPAYERS, PARENTS, TEACHERS, STUDENTS DESERVE TO KNOW HOW WE'RE DOING AND HAVE SOME WAY OF MEASURING THAT HOW WE ALSO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T UNDERMINE EITHER THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OR THE CURRICULUM. BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A LOT OF SCHOOLS IS THAT THE EMPHASIS ON THE TEST IS LEADING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS CUTTING OUT ART AND MUSIC AND PROGRAMS FOR GIFTED KIDS AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION. AND A LOT OF COURSES THAT ARE PART AFTER WELL-ROUNDED EDUCATION. SO WHAT ARE WE REALLY ACCOMPLISHING HERE? AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENING IS THE WAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DEFINED IT, IF A CHILD SHOWS UP THE DAY BEFORE THE TEST AND THAT CHILD HAS NEVER BEEN IN YOUR SCHOOL, MAYBE THAT CHILD DOESN'T SPEAK HE THINKS LISH THAT CHILD STILL HAS TO BE TESTED. AND THAT GOES IN TO HOW YOU'RE EVALUATED. THAT DOESN'T STRIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE AS VERY FAIR BECAUSE WHAT DOES THAT TELL BUT A SCHOOL OR A GROUP OF TEACHERS? THERE ARE SO MANY ILLOGICAL DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THE IDEA WAS NOT BAD BUT THE WAY THAT IT WAS STRUCTURED AND IMPLEMENTED HAS CAUSED SO MANY PROBLEMS. AND WE NEED TO RESCUE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM THIS TOP-DOWN IMPOSITION OF TESTING AND HAVING TESTING DID HE FIND AS THE WAY YOU DETERMINE WHETHER EDUCATION IS GOOD. I DON'T BUY THAT. SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN UNPACK IT AND FIX IT AND REALLY GET BACK TO A MUCH BETTER WAY OF JUDGING HOW KIDS ARE LEARNING AND THEN PROVIDING THE INDIVIDUAL HELP THE KIDS NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. [APPLAUSE] >> I'M ORIGINALLY FROM MICHIGAN AND I GREW UP IN MICHIGAN. AND MANY OF YOU CAN REMEMBER WHEN GENERAL MOTORS MOVED OUT, UNTIL MANY YEARS LATER THERE'S STILL A LACK OF JOBS. TODAY WHEN WE GO TO PLACES LIKE WAL-MART WE SEE THAT MOST OF THE THINGS MADE THERE ARE ACTUALLY MADE IN CHINA AND OTHER PLACES. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WITH ALMOST 300 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA CLEARLY WE NEED TO ACTUALLY BUILD THINGS IN AMERICA. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY THE GOVERNMENT CAN HELP PROTECT JOBS AND KEEP THEM HERE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE? >> I'M REALLY GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] . >> YOU KNOW, I SHARE YOUR CONCERN THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE A MANUFACTURING BASE WHERE WE ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS, OUR ECONOMY WILL BEGIN A DOWNWARD SLIDE. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MAKE THINGS AND YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WORKING TO CREATE PRODUCTS, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A BROAD-BASED ECONOMY THAT WILL PROVIDE GOOD JOBS FOR THE MAJORITY OF YOUR PEOPLE. I START -- BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS, I STARTED SOMETHING CALLED THE MANUFACTURING CAUCUS IN THE SENATE. I TEAMED ONE A REPUBLICAN, WE CAME AT IT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES. HE'S LINDSEY GRAHAM THAT REPRESENTSNi SOUTH CAROLINA. HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. I WAS WORD -- WORRIED ABOUT THE IND INDUSTRIAL PLANT OF NEW YORK, THE JOBS THAT ARE BEING SHIPPED OUT TO CHINA AND ELSEWHERE. HERE ARE FIVE THINGS THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY OUR OLDER COMPANIES WITH LEGACY COSTS ARE DYING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF ALL THOSE COSTS. IF YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE AND PENSION BENEFITS FOR YOUR RETIRED WORK FORCE PLUS YOUR ACTIVE WORK FORCE, YOU ARE ALREADY STARTING WAY BEHIND YOUR FOREIGN COMPETITORS. WE NEED TO HELP THOSE COMPANIES CREATE A MEANS FOR PAYING THEIR CONTRACTUAL DEBT TO THEIR WORK FORCE BUT BY HELPING THEM COVER SOME OF THOSE LEGACY COSTS IN RETURN, FOR THEM MAKING SOME DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO UPGRADE THEIR EQUIPMENT, BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE. SO THE WHOLE LEGACY COST ISSUE, THE HEALTH CARE BURDEN COST ON MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES PUTS US AT A SEVERE DISADVANTAGE. ONE OF THE REASONS I WANT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IS TO MAKE US COMPETITIVE AGAIN. AND THAT GOES RIGHT TO THE HEART OF WHETHER MANUFACTURING CAN SURVIVE. NOW, SECONDLY, WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT SUPPORTS NEW MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND ACTUALLY PROVIDES GOVERNMENT BACK-UP TO COMPANIES THAT WILL RETOOL PLANTS, THAT WILL PUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN AND MAYBE GET LONG-TERM LOAN GUARANTEES OR OTHER MEANS TO IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL SCOMPLANT PROCESSES WITHIN THE PLANT TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH FOREIGN COMPETITION. SO THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO HAVE A POLICY THAT BACKS THAT UP. THIRDLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT MANUFACTURING IN AMERICA, IT'S A HIGH ENERGY USER. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE GOT TO GET ENERGY COSTS DOWN. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HELP REINVENT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES TO BE PART OF THE NEW ENERGY FUTURE. WHEN I WAS IN IN ABOUT YOUR LEN YESTERDAY MORNING THE PAPER PLANT WAS CLOSED BUT I WAS HOPING THAT SOMEONE WITH CASH AND EXPERTISE WOULD COME ALONG TO HELP TRANSFORM THOSE PAPER MILLS INTO ENERGY PRODUCERS USING WOOD AND WOOD PRODUCTS AND WOOD WASTE. THIS WOULD PUT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO WORK, IT WOULD HELP US WITH OUR ENERGY FUTURE, IT WOULD HELP US WITH GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. WE CAN CREATE NEW JOBS IN MANUFACTURING THROUGH A NEW ENERGY POLICY. THE FINAL THING -- THE FOURTH THING I WOULD SAY IS OUR TRADE POLICY IS REALLY STACKED AGAINST MANUFACTURING. AND WE NEED A TRADE POLICY THAT IS SMART, PRO-AMERICAN TRADE. NOW, WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT? WELL, I THINK TRADE AGREEMENTS SHOULD HAVE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] AND I ALSO THINK THAT WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE TRADE AGREEMENTS WE HAVE AND WE NEED TO GET TOUGH ON THOSE COUNTRIES THAT VIOLATE TRADE AGREEMENTS. WE OPEN OUR MARKETS TO THEM, THEY COME UP WITH A MILLION EXCUSES TO KEEP THEIR MARKETS CLOSED TO US. AND WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING IN ORDER TO MAKE TRADE, ONCE AGAIN, TO AMERICA'S BENEFIT. AND FINALLY -- AND I WANT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT. WE NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE LEADERSHIP OF AMERICAN BUSINESS TO REMEMBER WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND WHAT HELPS THEM BE SO SUCCESSFUL. [APPLAUSE] >> I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXAMPLE. AND I'VE SAID THIS IN PUBLIC BEFORE. DO I A LOT OF WORK WITH THE STEEL WORKERS. WE USED TO HAVE A LOT OF STEEL WORKERS, NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF RETIREES IN WESTERN NEW YORK. AND I'M TALK TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE STEEL WORKERS THE OTHER DAY. AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE SAID WE HAVE SO MANY LABOR CONFLICTS WITH AMERICAN STEEL AND WITH AMERICAN MANAGERS AND C.E.O.'S, HE SAID BUT THIS GENTLEMAN FROM INDIA WHO IS NOW LIKE THE THIRD-RICH HEST MAN IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN BUYING STEEL MILLS ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND HE BOUGHT A BUNCH OF MILLS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, BUT HE ASKED TO SEE ME. AND HE ASKED TO SEE ME ONCE A MONTH. AND HE INVITED ME TO HIS HOME, AND HE SAID I WANT TO WORK OUT ANY PROBLEMS WE HAVE. I LOVE THE AMERICAN WORK FORCE. I WANT YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL HERE. HE SAID, I COULD GET A BETTER AMOUNT OF RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING OUT OF SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN A PART OF OUR AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO BENEFIT FITTED FROM ALL THAT CAME FORWARD, THAN I COULD SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP HERE, SOMEBODY THAT WENT TO SCHOOL HERE, SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO HIS WORK FORCE AND THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO KEEP AMERICA COMPETITIVE. SO THAT'S LIKE FIVE THINGS THAT I WOULD DO IMMEDIATELY TO TRY TO GET US BACK IN AN EFFECTIVE MANUFACTURING ROLE. [APPLAUSE] >> WAY BACK THAT, THE YOUNG WOMAN WITH THE WHITE HAT. IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE THAT WHITE HAT. >> I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR PLAN IS ABOUT -- TO PREVENT GLOBAL WARMING. >> THANK -- THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME ABOUT THAT. THE TWO THINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT EVERYWHERE, WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THE GENERAL SIDE IN DARFUR AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. THE FIRST THING IS TO TRY TO GET OUR GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE IT AS A THREAT. AND THAT WILL BE -- [APPLAUSE] >> THAT WILL BE ONE OF MY GOALS. I'M ON THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE. MY FORMER CHAIRMAN ON THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE, THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN, WOULD NEVER LET US WRITE A BILL ABOUT GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE HE SAID IT WAS A HOAX. WE NOW HAVE A NEW CHAIR WOMAN, SENATOR BARBARA BOXER FROM CALIFORNIA. [APPLAUSE] >> AND WE HAVE STARTED WORK AND WE ARE GOING TO WRITE A BILL ABOUT GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. NOW, I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET ENOUGH REPUBLICAN SUPPORT THAT THEY WILL HAVE READ THE SAME NEWS WE READ, SEEN THE SAME PICTURES OF POOR POLAR BEARS STUCK ON LITTLE, TINY ICE FLOES IN DANGER OF BECOMING EX STINTH IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING. WE NEED TO START MAKING PROGRESS NOW. AND THE BIG ARGUMENT THAT THE REPUBLICANS MAKE ABOUT GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS THAT WE CAN'T COULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WILL WRECK OUR ECONOMY. NOW, LET ME JUST GIVE YOU TWO LITTLE FACTS HERE. ONE, I BELIEVE, BASED ON WHAT I'VE ALREADY SEEN HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY, WE WILL CREATE NEW JOBS IF WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE I HAVE WORKED WITH COMPANIES IN NEW YORK THAT ARE EMPLOYING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE MAKE ALTHOUGH-SULPHURRED DIESEL ENGINES FOR TRUCKS AND MAKING DIESEL POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES FOR SCHOOL BUSES. SO THAT'S JUST TWO EXAMPLES I CAN GIVE YOU. BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH PULLED US OUT OF KYOTO AND SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN KYOTO PAUSE IT WILL WRECK OUR ECONOMY, HE DIDN'T PUT US INTO ANY OTHER PROCESS THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY BRING US GLOBALLY TOGETHER. GREAT BRITAIN WENT INTO KYOTO AND THEY ARE MEETING THEIR TARGETS BUT EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT, THEY ARE CREATING THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS, DOING THE WORK OF CONTROLLING CO2 AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE CAN DO THIS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA AND I'M DETERMINED THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE, SIR. >> I'LL TRY NOT TO MAKE THIS A CRUSADE OR A SERMON. >> WELL,S IS SUNDAY. >> WE NOW HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN PRISON THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THE TWO BIGGEST KILLERS -- TWO OF THE THREE BIG HEST KILLERS IN AMERICA ARE TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL. AND GOING TO JAIL ELIMINATES YOU FROM THE WORK FORCE OF ANY REASONABLE JOB FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME WE STARTED TREATING DRUGS LIKE WE TREAT TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL AND EDUCATE PEOPLE LIKE WE'RE DOING WITH CIGARETTES AND IT'S WORKING WHERE THEY'RE STOPPING SMOKING, CAN WE DO THAT WITH ILLEGAL DRUGS AND SAVE A LOT OF OUR YOUNG, FUTURE ENGINEERS, ET CETERA? THANK YOU. >> THANKS YOU. WELL, I BELIEVE THAT OUR RATE OF INCARCERATION, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD, I THINK NOW, HAS TO BE SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED. AND ONE OF THE PLACES TO START IS WITH NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS AND TRYING TO FIND DIVERSIONS AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT IS, YOU KNOW, DRUG OFFENSES, SUBSTANCE ABUSE. BECAUSE WE DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB IN OUR SOCIETY HELPING PEOPLE WHO WANT HELP. AND PEOPLE MAKE THE DECISION FINALLY AFTER A LOT OF PAINFUL SOUL SEARCHING AND TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES, THEY WANT HELP AND THEY'RE TOLD, WELL, GET IN LINE, MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL SEE NEW THREE MONTHS. WE JUST DON'T TAKE SERIOUSLY THESE REALLY DIFFICULT SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS. AND WE SHOULD. I THINK -- YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD BE THE WAY -- THE PLACE I WOULD START WITH LOOKING AT NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS AND LOOKING AT MORE TREATMENT, LOOKING AT DIVERSION AREA PROGRAMS LIKE DRUG COURTS THAT TELL PEOPLE IF YOU GET TREATMENT, IF YOU STAY CLEAN, YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AVOID JAIL. BUT WE'RE CREATING GIGANTIC REVOLVING DOOR. BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT ATTITUDES, WE PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL AND WE DON'T HELP THEM VERY MUCH. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE LOCKED AWAY AND NEVER LET OUT. WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PRISONERS ARE GOING TO BE REENTERING SOCIETY AND THEY'RE NOT GOING SO HAVE MUCH HELP IN KICKING DRUG HABITS OR GETTING SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO BE EMPLOYED OR MUCH ELSE. SO WE HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND THE COST OF IT. BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE TO INCARCERATE SOMEBODY THAN TO SEND SOMEBODY TO COLLEGE. SO THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR UPWARD, BACKWARD PRY ORTS OR THE. >> SENATOR, I'M GETTING THE WORD THAT WE HAVE TIME FOR ABOUT ONE MORE QUESTION AND I KNOW YOU'LL BE BACK. >> I WILL DEFINITELY BE. >> CAN YOU CALL IN SOMEBODY? >> OH, NO, YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME TO MAKE THAT DECISION. >> I WILL STAY HERE AND PEOPLE CAN COME UP AND ASK ME YOUR QUESTIONS AND IF WE DIDN'T GET TO ASK THEM. GREAT, GREAT. IF THERE'S SOMEONE -- I CAN SEE THIS WAY. >> WE JUST TALKED ABOUT NONVIOLENT CRIMINALS. AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, THE COUNTRY'S SEEN AN INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME AS WELL AS THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND AS PRESIDENT, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET TOUGH ON CRIME AND WHAT SUPPORT ARE YOU GOING TO OFFER LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS IF >> I'M REALLY, REALLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT CRIME -- VIOLENT CRIME IS GOING UP AROUND THE COUNTRY. I MET WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE HAD THIS MORNING IN MANCHESTER, THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE POLICE OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN MURDERED. AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT CRIME IS GOING UP AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS WITHDRAWING THE SUPPORT TO HELP POLICE OFFICERS FIGHT CRIME ON THE STREETS. YOU KNOW, DURING THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, WE HAD THE SO-CALLED COPS PROGRAM, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THE COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES PROGRAM. WE PUT MORE THAN 100,000 FEDERALLY-FUNDED POLICE ON THE STREETS WHERE THEY COULD BE PART AFTER MUCH GREATER FORCE TO BE ABLE TO CATCH AND PREVENT CRIMINALS FROM DOING HARM TO PEOPLE. PRESIDENT BUSH HAS TRIED TO ELIMINATE THE COPS FUNDING AND IN HIS LATEST BUDGET THAT'S WHAT HE DOES, BASICALLY. THAT'S VERY LITTLE IT HAVE LEFT. HE'S ALSO CUTTING MOST OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT MONEY THAT USED TO COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SOMETHING CALLED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT BLOCK GRANT THAT WOULD HELP LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS GET THE EQUIPMENT AND THE TRAINING THEY NEED. I THINK THAT'S A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. PART OF THE REASON CRIME FELL IN THE 1909'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY, FROM ONEND OF THE COUNTRY TO THE OTHER, IS BECAUSE WE PUT MORE POLICE ON THE STREET. IT JUST MAKES SENSE. YOU'VE GOT MORE POLICE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT CRIME. SO WHIM PRESIDENT, WE WILL BRING BACK WHAT WORKS. WE WILL ONCE AGAIN REINSTITUTE THE COPS PROGRAM AND OTHER FUNDING TO LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS SO YOU CAN DO THE JOB WE EXPECT YOU TO DO. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. SO WE WILL HAVE SENATOR CLINTON BACK, RIGHT? >> YES, I WILL BE BACK. >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. YOU ARE GOING TO BE HERE -- >> I WILL STAY AND ADVICE WIT PEOPLE. >> YOU CAN STAY SO YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME ON UP AND MEET WITH SENATOR CLINTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT WAS GREAT. >>",2015-11-07 17:20:26,2007-02-11,Keene,New Hampshire

WE'LL HAVE FUN AND DEFINE THE REAL HILLARY CLINTON AND SHE WILL NOT BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] >> SO, IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE OF ARKANSAS, THE 44TH GOVERNOR, SERVED 10 AND A HALF YEARS. HE'S A PROUD BAPTIST OF WICHITA COLLEGE. PLEASE WELCOME THIS OUR CANDIDATE, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS IN ARKANSAS BEING A REPUBLICAN IN A STATE WHERE 86% OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE DEMOCRAT I TELL PEOPLE IT WAS LIKE BEING A FAIR HYDRANT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OF DOGS. NOT THE MOST POPULAR POSITION FROM WHICH TO START. I HAD JUST BEEN ELECTED LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK TO A ROTARY CLUB. I GOT THERE A LITTLE EARLY. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS AT THE RIGHT PLACE. GOT OUT OF THE CAR ON THE WAY UP TO THE BUILDING AND AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WAS COMING UP TO THE BUILDING AND I SAID TO HIM IN PART TO MAKE SMALL TALK AND IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE I WAS AT THE RIGHT PLACE. I SAID EXCUSE ME SIR. IS THIS WHERE THE ROTARY CLUB MEETS. AS WE PASSED HE SAID, YEAH, IT IS, BUT YOU SURE PICKED A BAD DAY TO VISIT. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS GONNA TALK TODAY. MY GREAT HOPE IS YOU DON'T SIT HERE TODAY AND SAY I PICKED A BADS DAY TO COME TO THE C-PAC CONFERENCE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME WHY I ENTERED THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF MY EGO. IT'S BECAUSE OF MY COUNTRY. I THINK IT'S WHY ARE YOU HERE AND WHY CONSERVATIVES RP INTERESTED IN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PROCESS. AND PERHAPS IN MANY WAYS VERY CONCERNED AS A CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT WE WILL BE IN FACT DRIVING THE POLITICAL FORCE IN THE 2008 ELECTION CYCLE. I BECAME A REPUBLICAN AS A TEENAGER IN THE 1960'S WHICH WASN'T EXACTLY PRIME TIME TO BECOME A REPUBLICAN AS A TEENAGER. THE REASON I DID IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF NAMES YOU MIGHT EXPECT, THOUGH THEY WERE INFLUENTIAL, LIKE LINCOLN OR GOLD WATER. IT WAS ACTUALLY A PERSON YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. MY BECOMING A REPUBLICAN AS A TEENAGER WAS BECAUSE OF A GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME WAS HASKELL JONES. HE WAS THE MANAGER AT THE HOPE ARKANSAS RADIO STATION. WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD HE GAVE ME A JOB. HE PUT HIS TRUST IN ME. I WORKED HARD FOR HIM. I DID MY BEST TO PROVE I WOULD BE RELIABLE. HE, IN TURN, GAVE ME UNLIMIT OPPORTUNITY. MUCH LIKE THIS COUNTRY HAS GIVEN PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME, UNLIMIT OPPORTUNITY. HASKELL JONES WAS BEEN OF THE FEW REPUBLICANS IN HOPE, ARKANSAS. THERE WEREN'T MANY AND SOME SAID THERE WEREN'T ANY EXCEPT THOSE WHO HAD MOVED WITH OR GOT MESSED WITH. HASKELL MOVED IN. I GOT MESSED WITH. I CAME TO REALIZE IT'S ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF AS A NATION WHEN WE UNDERSTAND OUR STRENGTH IS NOT WHO WE ARE NOT BECAUSE OF A CHOICE OF A GROUP WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE TO BELONG TO BUT WHETHER WE STAND ON OUR OWN TWO FEET AND USE THE RESOURCES AROUND US AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH PEOPLE WHO DO THEIR VERY BEST TO REMEMBER THAT EVERY RIGHT THAT WE HAVE HAS TO BE BALANCED WITH A RESPONSIBILITY TO ACHIEVE AND TO BE HONEST. HASKELL JONES TURNED A RADIO STATION OVER TO A KID. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. HE GAVE ME THE KEY TO A RADIO STATION AT AGE 14. I WOULD UNLOCK IT, DO SPORTS, WEATHER, PLAY RECORDS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS. I LOOK BACK AND I AM THINKING I WOULDN'T GIVE THE DEE A 14-YEAR-OLD TO A BROOM CLOSET MUCH LESS OPERATE A RADIO STATION. BUT HE RUBBED OFF ON ME. HE WAS THE ULTIMATE AMERICAN PATRIOT, HARD CORE CONSERVATIVE AND REPUBLICAN WHO BELIEVED THIS COUNTRY WAS WORTH FIGHTING FOR, STANDING UP FOR, AND THE PRINCIPLES THAT MADE IT GREAT WERE THE PRINCIPLES OF FAITH, FAMILY, FREEDOM. WHEN I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS THE FIRST MALE IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY TO EVEN DO THAT. FOR ME TO GO ON TO COLLEGE MEANT WORKING 40 HOURS A WEEK IN A RADIO STATION AND CARRYING AS MANY CLASS HOURS AS I COULD SO I COULD GET THROUGH IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS INSTEAD OF FOUR BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD OF FOUR. I DON'T SAY THAT SO YOU SAY GOSH WHAT A STORY. I WANT TO YOU SAY GOSH, WHAT A COUNTRY. WHERE A KID LIKE ME GROWING UP IN A TOWN WHERE MY FATHER DIDN'T HAVE A SEAT ON A STOCK EXCHANGE BUT ON THE FIRE TRUCK. WHEN I WAS 14 HE TOOK ME TO MEET THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. HE SAID I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU DOWN WHERE THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO TALK. YOU MAY LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND YOU MAY NEVER GET TO MEET THE GOVERNOR. LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT HIS BOY WOULD BECOME THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT'S WHY I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. IT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT MUST STAND CLEAR, FIRM, CONSISTENT AND AUTHENTIC IN MAKING SURE THAT WE PRESERVE NOT JUST WINNING AN ELECTION, BUT KEEPING A COUNTRY. THIS CONFERENCE IS CALLED C-PAC AND MAYBE THIS WEEKEND IT MIGHT BE RENAMED THE CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENTIAL ANXIETY CONFERENCE. THE THEME MIGHT BE, DUDE, WHERE'S MY CANDIDATE? I'D LIKE TO THINK MAYBE HE'S STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU. I BELIEVE THIS. IF WE'RE GOING TO HELP AMERICA BE THE BEST IT CAN BE FOR ITS FUTURE, IF WE BELIEVE THE GREATEST GENERATION IS NOT THE GENERATION BEHIND US BUT THE GENERATION YET TO EVEN BE BORN, THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT BEING A LEADER IS ABOUT BEING A THERMOSTAT, NOT A THERMOMETER. THE THERMOMETER CAN READ THE TEMPERATURE AND DOES AND REPORTS WHAT THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM IS. IT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING. I GUESS IN GLOBAL WARMING IT GETS WARMER. WHEN WE HAVE AN ICE AGE IT GETS COOLER, BUT WE DON'T NEED THERMOMETERS. WE NEED THERMOSTATS. IT CAN READ THE TEMPERATURE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS BUT THE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE TO WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE, NOT SIMPLY REFLECT WHAT IT ALREADY IS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO ELECT PEOPLE WHO REFLECT A CULTURE AND A COMMON VIEW BUT DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE IT. WE NEED THERMOSTATS WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PREVAILING WINDS ARE, BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PREVAILING WINDS AND PRINCIPLES MUST BE IF THIS GREAT REPUBLIC OF OURS IS GOING TO SURVIVE AND COME TO ITS GREATEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES. [APPLAUSE] >> I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT, THE ONLY THING THAT WILL MATTER IN THIS ELECTION IS CELEBRITY AND MONEY, WHO HAS THE MOST FAMILIAR NAME AND WHO HAS RAISED THE MOST MONEY. MY DEAR FRIEND, MAY I SAY TO YOU IF CELEBRITY AND MONEY ARE THE CRITERIA TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THEN PARIS HILTON MIGHT BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] >> TODAY WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE HAD WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS EXPERIENCES ON EVERY ISSUE FROM GUNS AND SAME SEX MARRIAGE TO THE SANCTITY OF LIFE AND TAXES. SO MANY HAVE HAD SO MANY ROAD TO DAMASCUS EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE HAD MORE THAN A SIRIAN CAMEL DRIVER. WHAT MATTERS IS CONSISTENCY, NOT IN WHAT WE HAVE SAID BUT IN WHAT WE HAVE DONE. I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR A FEW MOMENTS THIS MORNING ABOUT THE KIND OF CONSERVATIVE THAT I BELIEVE AMERICA IS STILL LOOKING FOR. IT'S THE KIND OF CONSERVATIVE THAT I THINK WILL LEAD THIS COUNTRY NOT AS I OFTEN SAY JUST HORIZONTALLY. AMERICANS, NOT THOSE OF US WHO ARE ACTIVISTS OR RUN FOR OFFICE NECESSARILY BUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN AROUND THE DINNER TABLE TONIGHT DOES NOT THINK IN HORIZONTAL TERMS, LIBERAL, REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT AS THEY DO IN VERTICAL TERMS. THEY WANT TO KNOW WILL THIS PERSON LIFT OUR NATION UP? OR TAKE OUR NATION DOWN? WILL THIS PERSON LEAD OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE TO ITS GREATEST POSSIBILITY? OR WILL THIS PERSON TAKE OUR CHILDREN DOWNWARD TO THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES? I BELIEVE IT DOES MATTER WHAT KIND OF PRINCIPLES WE TAKE TO OUR CANDIDATESIES AND PUBLIC OFFICE. IT STARTS WITH SOMEONE WHO IS A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE. I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU, YOU MAY HEAR TALK THAT I'M NOT ONE AND I WOULD WANT TO DIFFER WITH THAT. AS A 10 AND A HALF YEAR GOVERNOR IN A STATE WHERE 90% OF THE PEOPLE ARE DEMOCRATS ELECTED TO PUBLIC OFFICE, I LED AND SIGNED THE FIRST BROAD-BASED TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF MY STATE IN MY FIRST YEAR AS GOVERNOR. IN 10 AND A HALF YEARS WE PASSED 90 DIFFERENT TAX CUTS, DOUBLED THE CHILD CARE CREDIT, INDEXED -- FOR INFLATION. WE CUT THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX. I SUPPORTED THE BUSH TAX CUTS IN 2001. I STILL SUPPORT THEM TODAY. THEY OUGHT TO BE PERMANENT, NOT BECAUSE OF POLITICS BUT BECAUSE OF THE PRINCIPLE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TAX PEOPLE'S TAXES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT'S WHY THEY SHOULD BE CAPPED. [APPLAUSE] >> WE LAUNCHED AN 800 HOT LINE IN ARKANSAS TO REPORT FRAUD, WASTE AND ABUSE. WE HAD OVER 1,000 CALLS. THERE WERE INDICTMENTS, CHARGES, THERE WERE CON VICTIONS. IT GOT TO BE WHERE THE FIVE MOST FEARED WORDS OF A POLITICIAN BECAME, WILL THE DEFENDANT PLEASE RISE. I BELIEVE A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE IS A PERSON WHO TRULY UNDERSTANDS IT'S NOT A PROBLEM IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT OUR TRACTIONS TOO LOW. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT OUR SPENDING IS TOO HIGH AND OUT OF CONTROL. [APPLAUSE] >> LET ME FURTHER SOME SPECULATION. I PLAN LATER TODAY THE DELIVER A SIGNED PLEDGE THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING A NO TAX PLEDGE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THAT WE WILL IN THE RAISE MARGINAL TAXES ON INCOME IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] >> IF YOU CHECK THE RECORD YOU'LL MIND MY RECORD AS A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE IS GENUINE. BUT IT'S NOT JUST BEING A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE THAT WILL WHIP THE ELECTION AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT BEING A FAMILY CONSERVATIVE. IT MEANS TO CHOOSE A GUARDIAN FOR YOUR CHILDREN SHOULD SOMETHING HAPPEN TO YOU. YOU WOULD BE ASKING THIS QUESTION. WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD I WANT TO ENTRUST MY CHILDREN AND THE TERMS OF THEIR FUTURE AND HOW THEY WOULD BE RAISED? LET ME ASK YOU, WHAT KIND OF CRITERIA WOULD YOU LOOK FOR IN A PERSON THAT YOU WOULD ASK TO BE THE GUARDIAN OF YOUR OWN CHILDREN? MY GUESS IS IT'S NOT JUST WHAT KIND OF HOUSE THEY HAVE OR WHAT KIND OF CAR THEY DRIVE OR WHERE THEY VACATION OR WHAT KIND OF EDUCATION THEY HAD OR WHAT COUNTRY CLUB THEY BELONG TO. MY GUESS IS WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER DO THESE PEOPLE POSSESS? CHARACTER DOES STILL MATTER. MOST OF US IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT BELIEVES MOTHERS AND FATHERS RAISE BETTER KIDS THAN GOVERNMENTS DO AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE FABRIC OF THIS NATION IS THE INSTITUTION THAT GOD HIMSELF CREATED BEFORE THERE WAS A GOVERNMENT AND EVEN A CHURCH. THAT WAS THERE WAS A MARRIAGE OF FAMILY. THAT'S THE FIRST, FOREMOST AND MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN OUR CULTURE. [APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR. THIS COUNTRY IS STRONG BECAUSE IT IS A CULTURE OF LIFE. WHAT SEPARATES US FROM THE ISLAMIC FASCISTS -- [APPLAUSE] >> IS THAT WE WERE A CIVILIZATION THAT CELEBRATES AND ELEVATES LIFE AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO ARE OUR MORTAL ENEMIES WHO CELEBRATE DEATH. WE WOULD NOT CONCEIVE OF STRAPPING A BOMB TO THE BELLY OF OUR OWN CHILD AND MARCHING IN THEM INTO THE ROOM OF INNOCENT PEOPLE AND BLOW THEM UP AND CONSIDER THAT A POINT OF OPEN THAT OUR CHILD HAS DIED FOR MARTYRDOM. WE VALUE HUMAN LIFE WHEN THE 13 MINERS WERE STAND IN SAGO, WE MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO FIND THOSE MINERS. WHEN ONLY ONE COULD BE SAVED, THE OTHERS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PERISHED, WE COLLECTIVELY WEPT BECAUSE WE VALUE EVERY HUMAN LIFE, A HIKER ON MOUNT HOOD, A MINER IN THE SAGO MIND OR AN UNBORN CHILD IN THE WOMB OF ITS MOTHER. [APPLAUSE] >> PLEASE DON'T COUNT ME AMONG THOSE WHO THINK THIS IS A PER RIFFAL ISSUE. IT'S HOW WE VIEW EACH OTHER AS HUMAN BEINGS. PLEASE UNDERSTAND WHILE I AM NOT UP ALTERABLY PRO-LIFE BUT I SAID WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION BUT CONTINUES AFTER BIRTH. AS A PRO-LIFE COMMUNITY, LET US FIGHT FOR SAFE NEABDS FOR CHILDREN, BETTER SCHOOLS THAT MEAN SOMETHING WHEN WE SPEND TAX DOLLARS ON EDUCATION, LET IT MEAN WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO GROW UP IN FREEDOM, WE'RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT CHILD FOR THE NINE MONTHS IN THE MOTHER'S WOMB, BUT ALSO THAT WE DO NOT NEGLECT THE IDEA THAT LIFE DOES BEGIN A AT CONCEPTION AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT OR CONFUSING. FRANKLY, I'M A LITTLE TROUBLED WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY I HATE ABORTION, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO REGULATE IT. OR HERE'S ONE I HEAR QUITE A BIT. WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT I HATE ABORTION, BUT I SUPPORT THE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT. LET ME TELL YOU IT WOULD BE LIKE A HINDU FRIEND OF MINE SAYING I DON'T CARE FOR THE SLAUGHTER OF BEEF BUT I'M BUYING A STEAKHOUSE. SOMETHING IS WRONG IN THAT CONCEPT. IT'S WRONG TO SAY THAT SOMEHOW WE CAN TINKER WITH THAT DEFINITION. JUST AS I BELIEVE IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT TO SOMEHOW BELIEVE WE CAN REDEFINE MARRIAGE TO MEAN ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IT'S MEANT FOR THE OVER 5,000 YEARS OF RECORDED HISTORY UNTIL MOSES HIMSELF COMES DOWN WITH TWO TABLETS OF STONE STATING BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, MARRIAGE OUGHT TO MEAN WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS MEANT. NOTHING ELSE AND NOTHING BUT. [APPLAUSE] >> I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T REDEFINE IN IT A FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT. WE SHOULDN'T TINKER WITH SOMETHING SO SACRED AS THE CONSTITUTION. LET ME REMIND YOU THE GENIUS OF OUR CONSTITUTION IS IT CAN BE AMENDED. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH AND OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY THE BASIC RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION. FOR THOSE WHO SAY WE SHOULDN'T AMEND THE CONSTITUTION, THEY SEEM MORE THAN WILL TO AMEND THE BIBLE, KORAN AND TALMUD. I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD AMEND A SACRED TEXT AND NOT THE CONS INSTITUTION. THAT'S WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE A FAMILY CONSERVATIVE. LET ME SUGGEST THAT A CONSERVATIVE MUST BE A FREE MARKET CONSERVATIVE. IF WE HAVE TOO MUCH LITIGATION THE RESULT IS A JOB MICHIGANGRATION. WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS FREIGHTERS GOING TO WORK ON FRIDAY AND GETTING A PINK SLIP AND FINDING THEIR JOB HAS GONE SOMEWHERE AND IT'S NEVER COMING BACK. NOT THAT THE FATHER'S WORK IS NO LONGER QUALITY. NOT THAT HE'S NOT EDUCATED OR WILLING TO LEARN NEW SKILLS. IT'S THAT TOO MUCH REGULATION, TOO MUCH LITIGATION HAS RESULTED IN HIS JOB MICHIGANGRATION. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- MIGRATION. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A FREE ENTER PRIZE WHERE OUR ECONOMY WORKS. ENTREPRENEURS AND INNOVATORS AND PEOPLE WITH MA'AM NATIONS CAN CREATE IDEAS THAT HELP CREATE JOBS. IT'S THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT CREATES JOBS, NOT GOVERNMENTS. PEOPLE SOMETIMES THINK IT'S WHAT GOVERNMENT DOES THAT CREATES A JOB. WHAT GOVERNMENT GETS OUT OF THE WAY IN DOING THAT CREATES THE JOBS AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE CREATIVE AND THINK AND INNOVATE. OUR FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE JUST THAT -- FREE. WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT FREE TRADE. FREE TRADE IS GREAT IF IT'S FAIR TRADE. IF OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T ENFORCE THE W.T.O. AND PUT THE SAME MANDATES ON THE CHINESE AND INDIANS AS OTHERS AS IT IMPOSES ON OURSELVES WE'RE NOT ENGAGED IN FAIR TRADE THEREFORE IT ISN'T FREE. IT MUST BE FREE BUT IT MUST BE FAIR. TO PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS FROM AN UNFAIR DISADVANTAGE, THE BEST THING TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES. GIVE US THE RULES. AMERICANS CANNOT ONLY COMPETE, BUT THEY CAN LIEUTENANTS WIN. BUT TAKE THE RULES AWAY FROM US, MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO PLAY ON A FAIR, LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY THE LEAST. A FREE ENTERPRISE CONSERVATIVE MEANS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT AN EDUCATION SYSTEM OUGHT TO PREPARE PEOPLE FOR A WORKPLACE. I HAVE A FRIEND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA ABOUT EDUCATION THAT WOULD EMPOWER STUDENTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN CHOICES. TODAY MANY KIDS ARE TOLD YOU CAN GO THIS DIRECTION OR THAT WITHOUT ANY IDEA WHETHER THAT STUDENT IS MAKING A GOOD, SOUND DECISION. THE IDEA THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE IS WORKING ON THAT OUGHT TO BE EXPORTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT IS A STUDENT WOULD HELP DESIGN A CURRICULUM BASED ON WHAT HE OR SHE IS IPT IN. IF A STUDENT WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO WORK ON A CAR RATHER THAN TAKE A SHOP CLASS WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY AND METHODS OF LEARNING HOW TO FIX A CAR MIGHT BE SO ANTIQUATED AS TO BE USELESS, THAT STUDENT WOULD GO TO THE CAR DEALERSHIP AND BE MEN TORD ON THE AUTOMOBILES HE OR SHE MIGHT WORK ON. THE AFTERSCHOOL JOB COULD BE CREDITOUSNESS POINTS. SAME FOR A MUE SICK STUDENT WHO MIGHT FLAY A ROCK BAND. OR A STUDENT IN DANCE WOULD GET ART CREDITS. IT'S A REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT IN WHICH THERE WOULD BE MORE WAYS TO GENERATE ACTIVITY AMONG STUDENTS. LET ME BE CLEAR. OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS TO HAVE HIGH STANDARDS AND CLEAR MEASURING TO FIND OUT HOW WE'RE DOING AGAINST THOSE STANDARD AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHEN WE STARTED THAT IN ARKANSAS, WE DID THAT WHEN I FIRST BECAME GOVERNOR. NOW WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW STATES IN THIS COUNTRY TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN OUR TEST SCORES. IF HILLARY IS NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT I WANT INDICATE TO SHOW MY RESULTS OF 10 YEARS OF GOVERNOR IN EDUCATION AND LET'S MEASURE THOSE TIME AND PROVE IT FOR THE STUDENTS AND WHOSE FOCUSES IS ON THE KIDS AND NOT THE TEACHERS UNIONS. THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL COMPARISON FOR US TO HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] >> I ALSO BELIEVE THAT A CONSERVATIVE MUST BE A FREEDOM CONSERVATIVE. LET ME SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. WE ALL UNDERSTAND WE ARE IN AN UNCONVENTIONAL WAR. I HAVE SAID AND I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART WE ARE NOT ON THE BRINK OF, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A WORLD WAR III. THE ISLAMIC FASCISTS WHO HAVE DEAL QAEDA ENMITY AGAINST US ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SETTLING THE LINES OF DEMARCATION THAT NORMALLY SETTLE WARS. THIS IS NOT A WAR ABOUT PROPERTY OR PERSONALITIES OR EVEN ABOUT POWER. WHAT MAKES IT SO UNUSUAL IS THAT THE RADICAL ISLAMIC FASCIST, NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENTIRE MUSLIM RELIGION, BUT THE RADICAL ISLAMIC FASCIST HAVE DECLARED WAR ON US DO SO FROM A THEELOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. A LOT OF PEOPLE I DON'T THINK UNDERSTAND WHEN THAT IS THE BASIS, THERE CAN BE NO NEGOTIATION. WHILE ONE MAY BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH DIPLOMATS, ONE DOES NOT NEGOTIATE WITH GOD. WHEN THEY DECLARE THAT IS SOLE PURPOSE IS THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAELI ISRAEL, THE UNITED STATES AND ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLES US, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN DETENTE OR CO-EXISTENCE. THEY ARE SOLELY DETERMINED FOR ONE THING, THAT IS NOT OUR DECLINE BUT OUR ULTIMATE AND ABSOLUTE ANNIHILATION AND DESTRUCTION. THIS IS A WAR WE CAN NOT AND MUST NOT LOSE. IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE A SHRINK BORDER. IT MEANS WE HAVE A NONEXISTENCE. THEY ARE NOT MARCHING UNDER THE BANNER OF A FLAG AND WEARING THE UNIFORMS OF SOLDIERS AND CARRYING THE BANNER OF A COUNTRY. IT IS AN UNCONVENTIONAL WAR. I'M CONVINCED IT WILL REQUIRE AN UNCONVENTIONAL RESPONSE THROUGH UNCONVENTIONAL MEANS WITH SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND HEAVY USE OF INTELLIGENCE AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF APPROACH TO FIGHT AND WIN IT. BUT THE ONE THING WE MUST BE COMMITTED TO AS A NATION, LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, URBAN OR RURAL, IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THIS ENEMY AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT AT STAKE IS NOT SIMPLY HIGHER TAXES, CHANGED LIFESTYLES, BUS EXISTENCE ITSELF AS A PEOPLE AND A CIVILIZATION. WE MUST WIN THIS WAR. [APPLAUSE] >> FREEDOM CONSERVATIVES MEANS WE BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE A SECURE BORDER. I TELL PEOPLE THIS IMMIGRATION DEBATE HAS BEEN A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. PEOPLE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT, ANGRY ABOUT IT. I THANK GOD EVERY DAY WHEN I GOT ON MY KNEES THAT I'M IN A COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO BREAK INTO RATHER THAN BREAK OUT OF. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT. BUT EVERY TIME I GET ON AN AIRPLANE IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, EVERY PERSON THAT WORKS THERE KNOWS WHO I AM. THEY CALL ME BY NAME, THE SKY CAP TAKING MY LUGGAGE AT THE CURBSIDE CHECK OR THE GATE AGENT OR THE OTHER PASSENGERS. YET, I STILL PULL OUT MY PHOTO I.D., PUT MY WALLET AND MY LAPTOP AND SHOES AND JACKET IN THOSE LITTLE PLASTIC TUBS AND TAKE EVERY PIECE OF METAL OUT OF MY POCKET AND SOMETIMES I THINK I'LL, STRIPPED WHEN I WALK THROUGH THE CHECKPOINT. THEY IN A WHO I AM AND THAT I DON'T POSE A RITA TO THE AIRPLANE. BUT BECAUSE I WALK THROUGH THOSE LAYERS OF SECURITY, I STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THOSE AUTHENTICATIONS OF WHO I AM. I'M NOT OFFENDED BY THAT. THAT'S THE LAW. THOSE ARE THE RULES. IF IT'S A TAX-PAYING, OFFICE-HOLDING AMERICAN CITIZEN, I HAVE TO PASS THROUGH SEVERAL LAYERS OF SECURITY AND PROVE WHO I AM WHEN THEY KNOW WHO I AM, IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE THAT PEOPLE WHO CROSS OUR BORDER MUST PROVE WHY THEY ARE COMING HERE, THEY DON'T HAVE A DISEASE OR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND AND WE CAN TRUST THEM TO DO ONLY WHAT THEY DO AND THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF SEATS ON THE PLANE WHEN THEY CROSS THE BORDER. FOLKS, THAT'S COMMON SENSE. [APPLAUSE] >> A FREEDOM CONSERVATIVE IS A PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS THE PURPOSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOT ABOUT DUCK HUNTING AND DEER HUNTING THOUGH I LOVE BOTH AND AM A LIFETIME MEMBER OF THE DUCKS UNLIMITED AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE N.C.R.A. -- I'M ALWAYS AMUSED IF NOT MAZED WHEN A POLITICAL CANDIDATE TRIES TO TELL ME THE PURPOSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS ABOUT HUNTING. THE PURPOSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS TO PRESERVE OUR FREEDOM AND OUR FOUNDING FATHERS UNDERSTOOD IT CLEARLY. THEY UNDERSTAND AN UNARMED, DISARMED CITIZENRY IS ONE TYRANT AWAY FROM THE LOSS OF THEIR FREEDOM. WHILE THAT MAY SEEM UP COMFORTABLE IN THE 21ST CENTURY TO TALK ABOUT LET NOT FORGET WE HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTECT THE FUTURE OF OUR FREEDOM. URE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS UNDERSTOOD IT. IT SHOULDN'T BE GEOGRAPHICAL. I HEAR PEOPLE SAY SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS ARE DIFFERENT IN ONE STATE THAN ANOTHER. LET ME BE CLEAR. THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT HAVE CHANGES OF AUTHORITY WHEN YOU CHANGE AN ADDRESS. IF IT WORKS IN ONE PART OF AMERICA, IT OUGHT TO WORK IN EVERY PART OF AMERICA. A FREEDOM EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTANDS THAT AND WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH IT. [APPLAUSE] >> I KNOW MY TIME IS LIMITED. I HAVE A WEBSITE. EXPLORE HUCKABEE.COM. THERE'S THE COMMERCIAL. I HOPE YOU CHECK IT OUT. I STAND HERE KNOWING FULL WELL I'M PROBABLY NOT THE FIRST CHOICE TO BE PRESIDENT ON WALL STREET. I PROBABLY AM NOT THE FIRST CHOICE TO BE PRESIDENT AMONG THE PEOPLE ON K STREET. I KNOW DARN SURE I'M NOT THE FIRST CHOICE TO BE PRESIDENT AMONG THE CROWD ON SUNSET BOULEVARD IN RODEO DRIVE. I JUST WANT TO BE THE FIRST CHOICE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON MAIN STREET OUT THERE IN THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA, WHO SHOP WAL-MART, WHO GO TO CHURCH, WHO HUNT, WHO FISH, WHO DRIVE PICK-UP TRUCKS AND LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC AND FOLLOW NASCAR AND ARE TIRED OF POLITICIANS TELLING THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR RATHER THAN WHAT THE POLITICIAN BELIEVES. I MAY NOT MAKE IT WITH EVERYBODY. I MAY NOT SELL TO SOME FOLKS. I MAY NOT RAISE ALL THE MONEY OTHER PEOPLE WILL HAVE OR RAISE. I MAY NOT HAVE THE CELEBRITY STATUS OTHERS HAVE. BUT IF YOU WANT TO CHECK ME OUT THROUGH MY TEENAGE YEARS WHEN HASKELL JONES GAVE ME A JOB AND HELPED INSTILL IN ME A LOVE OF THIS COUNTRY AND AN UNDERSTAND THAT BE A POOR KID LIKE ME THAT COULD BARREL PAY THE RENT COULD RISE TO BE GOVERNOR AND AS ENTIRE TO BE PRESIDENT, I'M TELLING YOU THAT THIS IS A COUNTRY WHERE KIDS LIKE ME STILL BELIEVE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. I UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE OUR FREEDOMS BEEN I REALIZE THAT THE POLITICIANS DIDN'T GIVE IT TO US. I UNDERSTAND THAT FREEDOM ISN'T REALLY FREE AFTER ALL. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A SCHOOLTEACHER AT THE ROBINSON HIGH SCHOOL IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, MARTHA COCHRAN. A SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER AND A COACH ON THE SIDE. IN SEPTEMBER OF 2005 MARTHA DID SOMETHING I'LL NEVER FORGET. MARTHA ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL WITH PERMISSION OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, THE PRINCIPALS PAL AND THE BUILDING SUPERVISOR TOOK ALL THE DESKS OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. THE KIDS CAME IN TO FIRST PERIOD. THERE WERE NO DESKS. THEY LOOKED AROUND AND SAID WHERE'S OUR DESKS AND SHE SAID YOU CAN'T HAVE A DESK UNTIL YOU TELL ME HOW YOU EARN THEM. THEY THOUGHT, MAYBE IT'S OUR GRADES. NO, SHE SAID. MAYBE IT'S OUR BEHAVIOR. SHE SAID NO, IT'S NOT EVEN YOUR BEHAVIOR. THEY CAME AND WENT IN THE FIRST PERIOD. NO DESKS IN THE CLASSROOM. SECOND PERIOD SAME THING. THIRD PERIOD. BY EARLY AFTERNOON TELEVISION NEWS CREWS HAD GATHERED IN HER CLASSROOM TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS CRAZY TEACHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE ESDESKS OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. THE LAST PERIOD MARTHA GATHERED HER CLASSROOM SITTING ON THE FLOOR. AND SHE SAID THROUGHOUT THE DAY NO ONE UNDERSTOOD HOW YOU AIRPLANE THE DESKS AND NOW I'M GOING TO TELL PU. AS SHE OPENED IT 27 U.S. VETERANS WEARING THEIR UNIFORMS WALKED INTO THAT CLASSROOM, EACH ONE CARRYING A SCHOOL DECK. THEY PLACED THOSE SCHOOL DESKS IN ROSE AND STOOD ALONG THE WALL. AND BY THE TIME THEY HAD FINISHED PLACING THOSE DESKS, THOSE KIDS FOR THE FIRST TIME I THINK PERHAPS IN THEIR LIVES UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY EARNED THOSE DESKS. MARTHA SAID, YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN THOSE DESKS. THESE GUYS DID IT FOR YOU. THEY PUT THEM OUT THERE FOR YOU. BUT IT'S UP TO YOU TO SIT HERE RESPONSIBLY TO LEARN, TO BE GOOD STUDENTS AND CITIZENS BECAUSE THEY PAID A PRICE FOR YOU TO HAVE THAT DESK. DON'T EVER FORGET IT. MY FRIENDS, SOMETIMES I THINK WE FORGET THAT THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE ARE FREEDOMS NOT BECAUSE OF CELEBRITIES, BUT FREEDOMS ARE BECAUSE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF. WHO NOT ONLY EARNED A SCHOOL DESK FOR A KID AT THE ROBINSON HIGH SCHOOL IN LITTLE ROCK, BUT EARNED A SEAT FOR YOU AND ME TO ENJOY THIS GREAT LAND WE CALL HOME. THIS WONDERFUL NATION THAT WE BETTER LOVE ENOUGH TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE WITH THE KIND OF CONSERVATIVE, SOLID VALUES AND PRINCE PALS THAT MADE US A GREAT NATION. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE PRESERVATION OF THIS GREAT UNITED STATES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >>",2015-11-07 17:20:55,2007-03-02,Washington,District of Columbia
http://www.c-span.org/video/?197137-6/campaign-2008,Campaign 2008,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"THIS MORNING'S FINAL CANDIDATE HAS AS HER BEST-SELLING BOOK DOCUMENTS TRULY EXPERIENCED LIVING HISTORY. AS FIRST LADY SHE STEPPED OUT OF TRADITIONAL ROLE OF HOSTING STATE DINNERS IN FAVOR OF AGGRESSIVELY ADVOCATING THE CAUSES IN WHICH SHE SO TRONGLY BELIEVED, HEALTH CARE, QUALITY EDUCATION AND DISEASE PREVENTION. SHE WAS ALWAYS MUCH MORE THAN THE AVERAGE FIRST LADY. A GRADUATE OF WELLESLEY AND YALE LAW SCHOOL. SHE WAS RATED AS ONE OF THE TOP 100 LAWYERS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. WHEN SHE WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER TWO TERMS, NO SURPRISE THAT SHE FINALLY DECIDED TO LAUNCH HER OWN POLITICAL CAREER. AND IN 2000 WITH THE VERY EARLY AND STRONG AND PROUD SUPPORT OF THE I.A.F.F. BEHIND HERE, SHE WON A SEAT IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AS NEW YORK'S JUNIOR SENATOR. SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN IN NEW YORK'S HISTORY TO WIN A STATEWIDE SEAT. AND LAST DWREER WAS RETURNED TO OFFICE AGAIN WITH OUR SUPPORT BY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. A CHAMPION OF LABOR AND WORKING FAMILIES. AND A TRUE SUPPORTER OF OUR AGENDA. SPECIFICALLY THE RIGHT FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR MEMBERS ACROSS THIS GREAT COUNTRY TO FINALLY HAVE THE ABLE TO WORK UNDER A CLEGGETIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. SHE SAID FREEDOM AND EQUALITY FOR ALL DEPEND ON WHETHER A CITIZEN TRULY HAS A VOICE. SHE SAID FREEDOM MEAN S THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO ASSEMBLE, ORGANIZE AND DEBATE OPENLY. WE APPRECIATE HER WORDS AND DEEDS. THERE ARE MANY ACO-LADSE THAT I COULD PAY IN THIS INSTRUCTION. THERE'S SO MUCH ONE COULD SAY. BUT I'D PREFER INSTEAD JUST TO SHARE AN ANEK DOTE. ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 12, 2001, WHILE THE FULL IMPACT OF 9/11 WAS STILL UNFOLDING, SENATOR HILLARY ROD HAM CLINTON INVITED ME TO HER OFFICE. AND WE BOTH MET WHILE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS TERRIBLE DISASTER. WITH NO PRESS. NO FANFARE. SHE SENT A FEW SIMPLE WORDS BEYOND EXPRESSING HER SYMPATHY FOR OUR MEMBERS, OUR FALLEN AND THEIR FAMILIES. SHE JUST SAID, HAROLD, I'LL DO ANYTHING. AND EVERYTHING YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS NEED TO LOOK AFTER OUR FIREFIGHTERS. AND TO TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILIES OF YOUR FALLEN. AND WITHOUT QUESTION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID. AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S CONTINUED TO DO EVERY SINGLE DAY SENSE. SISTERS AND BROTHERS, PLEASE WELCOME A FRIEND OF THIS UNION, A FRIEND OF, AND OUR MEMBERS FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS. SOMEONE WHO I NOT ONLY HAVE COME TO ADMIRE PERSONALLY, BUT WHO IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE, SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] (music) >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL. THANKS SO MUCH. AND THANKS FOR LAST NIGHT, TOO. [LAUGHTER] IT'S AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. THIS IT WAS A LOT OF FUN TO BE HERE LAST NIGHT. AS I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM, WHICH IS PACKED WITH PEOPLE WHOM I ADMIRE SO MUCH, I SEE A LOT OF OLD FRIENDS. AND IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO STAND WITH YOU. WE'VE STOOD TOGETHER IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD TIMES. WE STOOD TOGETHER WHEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD NEVER END AND WHEN WE FINALLY SAW THE LIGHT. SO IT IS JUST A PERSONAL HONOR OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE TO BE HERE TODAY. AND I WANT TO THANK ALSO -- [APPLAUSE] MY FRIEND AND YOUR GREAT LEADER FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION. HAROLD AND VINNY HAVE BEEN THE HEART AND SOUL OF LEADING THIS GREAT, GREAT UNION. AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. BUT THE THING ABOUT GOING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES WITH HAREL AN VINNY ON YOUR SIDE IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ALON. AND THAT HAS MEANT THE WORLD TO THOSE OF US WHO NEW YORK. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FIREFIGHTERS FROM ACROSS NEW YORK HERE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO EVERYBODY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND THE SERVICE AND COMMITMENT THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN THAT YOUR NATION, I KNOW THAT FOR ALL OF YOU COURAGE IS A JOB REQUIREMENT. YOU DON'T MAKE THIS DECISION TO BE A FIREFIGHTER EASILY OR QUICKLY. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE SACRIFICE AND YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES. FOR YOU WHEN YOU GO TO WORK, WHEN YOU GO TO THAT FIRE HOUSE OR THAT STATION, THESE ARE NOT JUST YOUR COLLEAGUES, THESE ARE MEMBERS OF YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY. AND I RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH THIS FAMILY BOTH THE ONE THAT YOU LEE AT HOME AS YOU KISS YOUR WIFE GOOD-BYE OR YOU TUCK YOUR SON INTO BED ARE PART OF COMMITMENT THAT YOU'VE MADE. AND I WANT TO ALSO THANK YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY TO SEE YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR TO SEE YOU LEAVE FOR THAT SHIFT AND JUST WAIT THE MAKE SURE YOU'VE COME HOME SAFELY AGAIN. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO YOUR FAMILIES AND TO EVERYBODY WHO LOVE YOU AND SUPPORT YOU IN THE WORK THAT YOU DO EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, HAROLD REFERRED TO OUR MEETING THAT WE HAD ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 12. ON THE DAY BEFORE, SEPTEMBER 11, NOT ONLY OUR COUNTRY BUT THE ENTIRE WORLD SAW FOR THEMSELVES WHAT FIREFIGHTERS ARE MADE OF. YOU ARE THE ONES WHO RAN INTO THE FIRE. YOU ARE THE ONES HO RAN INTO THE DUST. INTO THOSE COLLAPSING BUILDINGS. FOR SOME OF YOUR BROTHERS AN SISTERS, IT WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW THEM. BUT PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT EVEN ON DUTY DROPPED EVERYTHING THEY WERE DOING TO BE THERE THAT DAY. PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN WORK FOR THE FDNY BUT WHO WORKED IN CONNECTICUT WHO WORKED IN NEW JERSEY DROPPED EVERYTHING THEY WERE DOING. AND PRETTY SOON TEAMS STARTED COMING FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. EVERYBODY SAYING WE WANT TO BE THERE. WE WANT TO WATCH YOUR BACK. WE WANT TO HELP SEARCH THAT WRECKAGE TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYBODY STILL ALIVE. WHEN HAROLD AND I SPOKE, IT WAS A TIME OF SHOCK AND CONFUSION. HAROLD WAS KIND ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE WHAT I SAID TO HIM, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID TO ME. HE SAID, WE WILL STAND WITH NEW YORK. FIREFIGHTERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN ACROSS OUR BORDER TO THE NORTH WILL BE THERE FOR YOU. WELL, HEARD, YOU WERE TRUE TO YOUR WORD. NOT ONLY YOU, BUT FIREFIGHTERS AND PAIR RA MEDICS AND OTHERS POURED IN TO OUR CITY. YOU SHARED EQUIPMENT FOR US. YOU RAISED MONEY FOR US. YOU WORKED SIDE BY SIDE WITH US. AND YOU PRAYED WITH US. YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE NEEDED YOU. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW, THAT I WILL BE THERE WITH YOU WHEN YOU NEED ME. [APPLAUSE] NOW, WE HAVE TO PUT THIS INTO A LITTLE BIT F A CONTEXT TODAY. I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU INCLUDING HEARD AND VINNY WERE PERHAPS A LITTLE UNSURE ABOUT ME WHEN I STARTED RUNNING. NOW THAT HAPPENS TO ME SOMETIMES. IN FACT, YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT BACK IN 2000, YOU ACTUALLY ENDORSED MY OPPONENT. BUT I NEVER SAW THAT AS ANY KIND OF OBSTACLE TO WORKING ON BEHALF OF YOUR NEEDS AN YOUR INTERESTS. JUST AS WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE IN NEW YORK, I SAID I WANTED TO BE A SENATOR WHO REPRESENTED MB. PEOPLE WHO WERE AGAINST ME. PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE AN OPINION. AND I WANTED TO FIND WAYS WE COULD MOVE A COMMON AGENDA FORWARD. AND OF COURSE, A CRISIS BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER. AND WE ROLLED UP OUR SLEEVES AND OVER THE YEARS, I'VE MADE WONDERFUL FRIENDS WITH MANY OF YOU. AND I WAS VERY PROUD IN MY LAST ELECTION TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE NEW YORK FIREFIGHTERS. THAT MEANT THE WORLD TO ME. BECAUSE WITHOUT FAIL WE HAVE TO STAND TOGETHER. WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING. AND I THINK WE CAN ONE AGAIN REASSERT AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP AS AT HOME, RESTORE OUR VALUES, FULFILL THE PROMISE OF AMERICA AND GET BACK TO LEADING THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAY. NOW THAT STARTS WITH RESTORING WHAT I CALL THE BASIC BARGAIN. SO MANY OF US GREW UP WITH THAT. YOU KNOW, WE WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WORKED HARD AND YOU PLAYED BY THE RULES, YOU'D BE ABLE TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. WELL, I DON'T THINK IN THE LAST SIX YEARS OUR COUNTRY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN LIVING UP TO THAT BASIC BARGAIN. THE LEADERSHIP HERE IN WASHINGTON SEEMS TO IGNORE MIDDLE CLASS AND HARD WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, HOUSEHOLD DEBT HAS SOARED. HEALTH CARE COSTS HAVE SKYROCKETED, ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE IT. WAGES HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE UP. AND PRODUCTIVITY IS UP. WHICH MEANS THAT AMERICANS ARE WORKING HARDER THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING REWARDED. I'LL TELL YOU WHO IS GETTING REWARDED COMPANIES LIKE HALLIBURTON WITH NO BID CONTRACTS THEN THEY MOVE THEIR C.E.O.'S ACROSS THE OCEAN TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND LEAVE US HANGING RIGHT HERE AT HOME. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH, THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX WHICH FALLS HEAVILY ON A ROT LOT OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES. FOR SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN SAYING WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, DO THE BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA NEED MORE TAX CUTS? DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO CUT THE TAXES OF MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE HIT BY THE ALTERNATIVE MIN TUM TAX? YOU KNOW, FOR SIX LONG YEARS, OUR PRESIDENT HAS NOT SEEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS. NOT OUR MIDDLE CLASS. NOT OUR WORKING FAMILIES. HE'S LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH THEM. TO THEM THEY'RE INVISIBLE. IF YOU'RE A CHILD SITTING IN A CRUMBLING SCHOOL YOU'RE INVISIBLE. IF YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO WORRIES ABOUT ENERGY COSTS OR SOMEONE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO FILL UP YOUR TANK, YOU'RE INVISIBLE. IF YOU'RE A HARD WORKING PARENT WHO NEEDS AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE WHILE YOU GO TO WORK, YOU'RE INVISIBLE. EVEN IF YOU'RE A SOLDIER RETURNING FROM COMBAT WHO NEEDS HEALTH CARE AND DISABILITY COMPENSATION, YOU ARE INVISIBLE. WELL THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAY OUR FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE BEEN TREATED, IF YOU'RE A PARAMEDIC WHO GOT SICK AFTER 9/11, IF YOU'RE A FEDERAL FIREFIGHTER WHO CAN'T QUALIFY FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION OR DISABLE RETIREMENT, IF YOU'RE A RETIRED FIREFIGHTER WHO CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE, WELL YOU'RE INVISIBLE TOO. IT'S GREAT FOR THE PHOTO OPS, BUT HOW ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN CARE OF US ACROSS OUR COUNTRY? PLAUCLSH [APPLAUSE] WELL I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR TODAY YOU'RE NOT INVISIBLE TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. AND YOU'RE SURE NOT INVISIBLE TO ME. AN WHEN WE RETAKE THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU WILL NO LONGER BE INVISIBLE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND I WANT TO SAY IN THIS PUBLIC SETTING THAT WHEN I'M IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I'M GOING TO BE THERE FOR YOU. WHENEVER YOU NEED ME, ON WHATEVER YOU NEED ME FOR. BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN TAKING CARE OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. IT IS PART OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. IT IS PART OF OUR MORAL. AND BEING THERE FOR YOU MEANS CONTINUING THE FIGHT TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO DO YOUR JOB. THE EQUIPMENT, THE PEOPLE, WHATEVER IT TAKES. SO LET ME TELL YOU WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH TRIED TO CUT THE FUNDING FOR THE SAFER ACT WHICH I CO-SPONNERED AND THE FIRE ACT, I TOOK THAT PERSONALLY. AND WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE FOUGHT HIM. WHEN HE DID IT AGAIN, WE FOUGHT HIM AGAIN. I'M GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING UNTIL FIRE AND SAFER ARE FULLY FUNDED WHATEVER IT TAKES. [APPLAUSE] NOW BEING THERE FOR YOU ALSO MEANS CARING FOR EVERY FIREFIGHTER, EVERY POLICE OFFICER, EVERY PARAMEDIC, EVERY VOLUNTEER OR WORKER THAT HAS FALLEN ILL IN THE AFTERMATH OF SEVEN. IT WASN'T JUST PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK THAT RESPONDED THAT DAY AND THE DAYS TO FOLLOW AND THE MONTHS TO FOLLOW. IT WAS PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. WHEN I FIRST VISITED THE SITING THE AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 12, I COULD BARELY SEE ANYTHING. THE DARK CLOUD WAS SO THICK. BUT I COULD FEEL IT. AS I WATCHED THE FIRST FIREFIGHTERS WALKING OUT OF THAT CURTAIN OF DARKNESS, COVERED IN BLACK SOOT, BARELY ABLE TO STAND, DRAGGING THEIR AXES BEHIND THEM, I KNEW THAT THE EFFECTS OF 9/11 WOULD LAST LONG AFTER SEPTEMBER 11. WITHIN DAYS, SO-CALLED WORLD TRADE CENTER COUGH BEGAN TO APPEAR. YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN THE PRIME OF THEIR LIVES DEVELOPED ASTHMA AND BRONCHITIS AND LARNJITE AND THINKER LIVERS WERE POLLUTED AND THEIR LUNGS FOR FAILING. AND PEOPLE WHO BEFORE SEVEN COULD LIFT THREE TIMES THEIR BODY WEIGHT COULD BARELY STAND. THEY COULDN'T SLEEP LYING FLAT IN THEIR BEDS ANYMORE, THEY HAD TO SIT UP ALL NIGHT LONG. PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE ABLE TO RUN MILES WITHOUT STOPPING, COULD NO LONGER BREATHE GOING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH MANY OF YOU AND WITH THE IAFF, WE CAN CREATED A PROGRAM TO SCREEN AND MONITOR THOSE THAT ARE SICK. AND WE GOT $90 MILLION TO EXPAND IT. WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH TRYING TO TAKE $125 MILLION BACK, WE KNEW WE HAD TO DRAW THE LINE. AND YOU ONCE AGAIN CAME IN AND HELPED US WIN THAT FIGHT. LET'S JUST SAY THE PRESIDENT PICKED A FIGHT WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE. WE WON IT -- [APPLAUSE] PU WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WITH YOUR HELP, I WAS ABLE TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION ASKING FOR MORE THAN $1.9 BILLION FOR MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH MONITORING AND TREATMENT. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS NOT JUST THIS YEAR AN NEXT YEAR, AS LONG AS OUR FIRST RESPONDERS OUR VOLUNTEERS AND RESIDENTS NEED HELP. BEING THERE FOR YOU ALSO MEANS GETTING SMART ABOUT HOMELAND SECURITY. AS YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL, WE CONFRONT A NEW ENEMY AND A NEW KIND OF WARFARE. IT'S REALLY THE WARFARE OF COWARDS. IT'S PEOPLE THAT SNEAK AROUND AND BLOW THEMSELVES UP OR PLACE BOMBS IN CARS WHO HAVE A PHILOSOPHY OF NE HILLISM. THEY MAY DRESS IT UP IN A PERVERSE VERSION OF RECOMMENDATION, BUT IT'S ABOUT DESTRUCTION AND DEATH. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE STAND AGAINST THEM. THEIR WARFARE IS NOT CONDUCTED BY ARMIES OR NAVIES BUT BY CRIMINALS, BY INSURGENTS, BY MILITIAS DRIVEN BY THIS TWISTED HATE. IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR MANY OF US BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THE RESOURCES TO MATCH THE RHETORIC. WE GET A LOT OF TOUGH RHETORIC OUT OF WASHINGTON. WHEN IT COMES TO PAYING FOR OVERTIME, GETTING YOU THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED, NOT THE EQUIPMENT THEY WANT TO GIVE YOU, PROVIDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND NOT PASSING IT THROUGH THE STATES, WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN WHAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. IN THIS LATEST BUDGET, THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING TO CUT FUND FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO THE TUNE OF $1.7 BILLION. WELL THE WAY I SEE IT, SAYING YOU BELIEVE IN HOMELAND SECURITY WITHOUT FUNDING FIRST RESPONDERS IS LIKE SAYING YOU BELIEVE IN BUILDING A HOSPITAL WITHOUT DOCTORS AND NURSES. IF WE DON'T FUND YOU, WE'RE NOT FUNDING OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. AN WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] AND AS HAROLD KNOWS AND ALL MY FOLKS FROM NEW YORK KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS SINCE SEPTEMBER 12. WE HAVE PUT IN LEGISLATION. WE'VE ASKED FOR MORE MONEY. WHEN FIREFIGHTERS CAN'T TALK TO POLICE OFFICERS, WHEN ENERGY RESPONDERS IN ONE STATE CAN'T TALK TO THOSE FROM ANOTHER, WE NOT ONLY SAW IT ON SEPTEMBER 11, WE SAW IT AGAIN DURING HURRICANE KATRINA. A CRISIS THAT REALLY ONCE AGAIN PUT FIREFIGHTERS IN THE FOREFRONT. AND JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHERE YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE TRYING TO OPERATE OUT OF TRAILERS AN THEY'RE STILL USING RUINED EQUIPMENT THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T REPLACED. WHAT WAS A NATURAL DISASTER WAS TURNED INTO A NATIONAL DISGRACE. WE NEED TO GET THE FUNDS DIRECTLY WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED. [APPLAUSE] AND BEING THERE FOR YOU MEANS TRYING TO TEND WAR IN IRAQ IN THE RIGHT WAY. BECAUSE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED IN IRAQ. AND WE WERE HEARTBROKEN TO LEARN THAT THOSE WHO HAD FOUGHT AND BEEN INJURED WERE LANGUAGE WISHING IN WALTER REED. I WENT OUT THERE A WEEK AGO EARLY IN THE MORNING TO MEET WITH A BUNCH OF SOLDIERS FROM NEW YORK. SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN TIED UP IN THE BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE UNTIL THEY WERE JUST BEYOND WORDS. THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT HAD I DONE TO DESERVE THIS? I SERVED MY COUNTRY ACTIVE DUTY, NATIONAL GUARD OR RESERVE. WHY AM I BEING TREATED LIKE THAT? THE 2006 ELECTION SENT A STRONG MESSAGE THAT WE DO NOT WANT OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SECTARIAN CIVIL WAR WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW WHO IS SHOOTING AT THEM AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHO'S SIDE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON. [APPLAUSE] NOW WE'RE TRYING TO INTRODUCE SOME RATIONALITY INTO THIS IN THE CONGRESS. TRYING TO STOP THE ESCALATION BECAUSE I PROFOUNDLY BELIEVE THAT PUTTING MORE OF OUR YOUNG MEM AN WOMEN INTO HARM'S WAY UNLESS THE IRAQI DECIDE TO DEFEND THIMSES, WE CANNOT END THIS WAR FOR THEM. IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STAND UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBLE, WE SHOULD NOT LOSE ANOTHER AMERICAN LIFE. WE SHOULD END THIS ESCALATION NOW. [APPLAUSE] I HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL EXTRICATE US FROM IRAQ BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE. BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU IF HE DOESN'T, WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, I WILL. [APPLAUSE] AND FINALLY, BEING THERE FOR YOU MEANS STANDING SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOU IN THE FIGHT FOR YOUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. AS HAROLD SAID IN HIS INTRODUCTION, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE WAY AMERICA WORKS THAT PEOPLE BE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY. NOW LEERLLY -- [APPLAUSE] NEARLY 90 YEARS AGO, WHEN 36 DELEGATES GATHERED FOR THE FIRST IAFF CONVENTION, 84-HOUR WORKWEEKS WERE IF NORM. AND TERRIBLE CONDITIONS WERE A FACT OF LIFE. THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE BECAUSE OF YOU. YOU ORGANIZED, YOU UNIONIZED, YOU STOOD UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS. YOU SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE INVEBLE. WE'RE DOING OUR PART. YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOU HAVE SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS, FAIR TREATMENT AND THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN. BUT SOME PEOPLE STILL DON'T GET IT. [APPLAUSE] THEY SAY THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WILL UNDERMINE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. THEY THINK YOU HAVEN'T EARNED THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THEM? I SAY WOULD YOU CHANGE PLACES? WOULD YOU GO INTO THAT FIRE? WOULD YOU STAND ON THOSE COLLAPSING FLOORS AND UNDER THOSE CRUMBLING CEILINGS? THE WAY I SEE IT, WHEN YOU PLUNGE HEAD FIRST INTO BURNING BUILDINGS FOR A LIVING, YOU HAVE MORE THAN EARNED THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE FOR BETTER CONDITIONS ON THE JOB. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THE DAYS OF GEORGE BUSH THINKING THE UNION BUG IS SOMETHING HE NEEDS TO SQUASH ARE OVER. WE ARE HERE TO STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WHO PULL CHILDREN OUT OF RAGING WATERS AND RESCUE PEOPLE FROM FLAMING ROOF TOPS. WE ARE HERE TO STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO STAND UP FOR US. NOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. AND WE CAN GET SOME SMALL VICTORIES ALONG THE WAY UNTIL WE FINELY GET THE MAJORITIES WE NEED TO COMPLETELY HAVE AN AGENDA THAT WE SUPPORT IN THE SENATE. THEY CAN STILL STOP A LOT OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, YOU AREN'T UNFINANCIAL, WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP ELECTING MORE PEOPLE THAT SEE THE WAY WE DO. WE'LL CERTAINLY MAKE A LOT MORE PROGRESS WHEN WE TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. BACK AFTER THE DAYS OF SEVEN, SO MANY OF YOU CAME TO ME AND SAID SO MANY OF THE FAMILIES WERE CONFRONTED WITH PILES OF PAPER WOK. THE FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. WORKING WITH HAROLD AND HIS TEAM, WE PUT TOGETHER A BILL AND MY FRIEND JERRY NADLER SPONSORED IT IN THE HOUSE AND WITHIN A WEEK THAT BILL PASSED INTO LAW. WHEN THE BILL PASSED WE DIDN'T DECLARE VICTORY OR DO SOME KIND OF BIG CELEBRATION. THE TRUTH IS THAT IN THE END THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO TO GIVE BACK TO THOSE FAMILIES THE PEOPLE THEY HAD LOVED AND LOST. ALL WE COULD DO IS TO COME TOGETHER AS A TEAM AN HELP AS BEST WE COULD. AND IN THE END, WE JUST FOLLOWED THE BASIC RULE YOU LIVE BY, YOU NEVER LEAVE A BROTHER OR A SISTER BEHIND. THAT'S HOW I TRIED TO SERVE IN THE SENATE. THAT'S HOW I TRIED TO SET MY PRIORITY. I WANT YOU TO KNOW IF I DO HAVE THE HONOR TAN OPPORTUNITY TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, THAT'S WHAT I WILL CONTINUE TO DO. NOW PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME WILL TELL YOU, I DON'T BACK DOWN FROM A FIGHT. AND OTHERS USE MORE COLORFUL LANGUAGE STATEMENT ACT ME. THAT'S JUST FINE WITH ME. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY. I JUST CARE ABOUT WHAT WE DO. THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME. AND BECAUSE I'M PROUD TO FIGHT FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU FIGHT FOR US, I'M GOING TO STAY ON YOUR SIDE. I'M NOT IN ANY WAY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIGHT THAT WE HAVE AHEAD BECAUSE I KNOW WE CAN WIN THIS FIGHT. I KNOW THAT IF WE STAND TOGETHER, WE GET OUR MESSAGE OUT TO AMERICA. IF WE STEEL OURSELVES TO ALL OF THE CRITICISM AND THE COUNTERATTACKS AND THE STEREO TIPES AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'LL PUT OUT, THEN WE'LL BE VICK TORE YUSS. I HAVE A LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN STAYING THE COURSE. AND IN STICKING WITH PEOPLE WHO STICK WITH ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, YOU KNOW ST. AUGUSTINE SAID A LONG TIME AGO, THAT HOPE IS REALLY THE COMBINATION OF TWO THINGSES. IT'S A COMBINATION OF ANGER AT THE WAY THINGS ARE. AND COURAGE TO CHANGE THE WAY THINGS ARE. WELL LIVING BY HOPE AND UNDERSTANDING WE CAN'T BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT WE SEE BEFORE US ON HOMELAND SECURITY OR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, BUT HAVING THE COURAGE TO STEP OUT AND TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENT FUTURE IS WHEN OF THE REASONS WHY I ADMIRE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR WORK ON BEHALF OF FIREFIGHTERS. I AM THRILLED AND HONORED TO STAND WITH YOU AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE THAT COURAGE AND ANGER ABOUT WHAT IS LEADS TO HOPE, MEANS THAT WE WILL CHANGE AMERICA FOR THE BETTER. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. AND GOD BLESS YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO. THANK YOU. TAKE CARE. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) >>",2015-11-07 17:21:21,2007-03-14,Washington,District of Columbia
http://www.c-span.org/video/?197322-1/campaign-2008-health-care-forum,Campaign 2008 Health Care Forum,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"MOST OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SPOKE OF THE DAYLONG FORUM ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES LAST WEEKEND IN LAS VEGAS. THE CENTER OF AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND AND THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION CO-HOST THIS EVENT AND INVITED ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. THE REPUBLICANS ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JOE BIDEN DECLINED BECAUSE OF A FAMILY CONFLICT. THAT THE REST OF THE DEMOCRATS OVER THE NEXT TWO HOURS AND 50 MINUTES. >> ELIZABETH EDWARDS WILL BE WITH US THIS MORNING, WHOSE GRACE AND STRENGTH THROUGH OWN HEALTH CARE BATTLE WITH CANCER IS AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL, WE PRAY FOR HER SUCCESS. THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND IS PROUD TO CO-SPONSOR THIS EVENT AT U.N.L.V.. THIS FORUM IS NOT ONLY THE FIRST TO FOCUS COMPLETELY ON OUR NATION'S HEALTH CARE CRISIS, BUT IT IS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL FORUM EVER TO TAKE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY FROM THE BLOGOSPHERE, THINK PROGRESS GOT BORED AND COURTESY OF A WIDE BY REAL NETWORKS. WE HOPE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN LAS VEGAS TODAY WILL ACTUALLY LEAVE LAS VEGAS AND SET THE TONE FOR THE ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. IT IS SIMPLY TIME TO MAKE AFFORDABLE QUALITY COVERAGE FOR EVERY AMERICAN IN REALITY. I DON'T NEED TO TELL NEVADANS THAT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF A FIX DID MORE THAN FOR UNDER 30,000 NEVADANS ALMOST ONE IN FIVE, LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE COSTS THAT HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN HEALTH EXPENDITURES OF ANY STATE OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS. THE SITUATION IN NEVADA HIGHLIGHTS CONCISELY WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OVERALL. IT COST TOO MUCH, IT COVERS TOO FEW, AND IT DELIVERS TOO LITTLE IN TERMS OF HEALTH OF OUR CITIZENS. TODAY, 45 MILLION AMERICANS ARE UNINSURED, INCLUDING 9 MILLION CHILDREN. SINCE 2000, HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS FOR WORKERS HAVE INCREASED FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES. TODAY THE AVERAGE FAMILY INSURANCE POLICY COST $11,840, THAT'S $1,000 MORE THAN A FULL-TIME MINIMUM-WAGE WORKER MAKES IN ONE YEAR. WHAT KIND OF VALUE TO GET FOR ALL THAT MONEY WAS SPENT ON HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES? NOT MUCH. THE U.S. CURRENTLY RANKS 31ST IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY AS 28TH ON INFANT MORTALITY. DO YOU KNOW, I THINK MY GRANDPARENTS WHO CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM A VILLAGE IN GRIESE 100 YEARS AGO WOULD ACTUALLY SHOCKED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT VILLAGE TODAY HAVE A LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN PEOPLE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES. AN HOUR GLOBALIZED ECONOMY, AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND NOT FEARING BETTER. BY 2008 HEALTH CARE COSTS WILL EXCEED PROFITS IN FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TODAY VIOLATES AMERICA'S DEEP COMMITMENT TO HUMAN DIGNITY FOR ALL AND FAIRNESS FOR ALL. AND IT HAMPERS OUR NATION'S ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PRESENTS US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN FIND LEADERS WHO ARE WILLING TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO CAN PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE. WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE SOME CANDIDATES WITH US TODAY WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL TO HAVE AN EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED AND ACCOMPLISHED MODERATOR, KAREN TUMULTY TO LEAD TODAY'S DISCUSSION COULD LET ME INTRODUCE MY GOOD FRIEND AND ALLY, AND EASTERN. ANDY IS AN ORGANIZER, VISIONARY AND A TRUE CHAMPION OF WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TENORS LEADERSHIP AZZI I USE BECOME THE FASTEST-GROWING UNION IN THE NATION, THE LARGEST HEALTH CARE UNION IN THE U.S. AND ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL POLITICAL FORCES IN THE COUNTRY. I PERSONALLY HONORED TO PARTNER WITH HIM WENT ON THE OTHER EFFORTS, SO PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING AND EASTERN. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU JOHN AND CAPS, VICE PRESIDENT FEIN AND U.N.L.V., AND OF COURSE THE SEVEN CANDIDATES, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE 1.8 MILLION MEMBERS OF SE I U WHO MAKE THIS FIRST ISSUE FORM OF THE 2008 ELECTION CYCLE POSSIBLE. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE SECRETARY-TREASURER OF SCI YOU, THE WOMAN WHO IS THE HIGHEST RANKING PERSON IN THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT, THE HEAD OF THE CHANGE TO WIND ORGANIZATION, AND THE BERGER. AND WELCOME ALL MEMBERS OF SE I U, NURSES, PUBLIC WORKERS, JANITORS AND HOME CARE WORKERS WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE CARE -- [APPLAUSE] QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS IS AN ISSUE ON EVERY AMERICAN'S MIND AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE IT IS ON EVERY CANDIDATES AGENDA. THAT MORE IS A NURSE. SHE WORKS AT THE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, WHICH CARES FOR HALF OF THE UNINSURED IN SOUTHERN NEVADA. SHE IS JUST ONE OF 1 MILLION AZZI I YOU HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, WHO TORE OFF ENTREAT THE PEOPLE WHO THE SYSTEM IS FAILING. PAT TALKS OF THE 10-YEAR-OLD CHILD WITH DIABETES, HIS FAMILY TRAVELED TO NEVADA, SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF A GOOD JOB AND A BETTER LIFE. DIABETES IS NORMALLY AN EASILY TREATABLE DISEASE. UNLESS THE REGULAR 40-DOLLAR COST FOR INSULIN TREATMENT. HER FAMILY TRIED TO GET BY BY STRETCHING THE MEDICINE OUT, BUT SADLY FOR THEIR SON, BUT THAT DID NOT WORK. HE WAS RUSHED TO THE ARE IN A COMA. THINK THAT, AFTER THREE DAYS OF INTENSIVE CARE AT THE HOSPITAL HE CAME OUT OF THE COMA AND HE RECOVERED. IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, A 40-DOLLAR BOTTLE OF INSEL PLAN SHOULD NOT BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHILD'S LIFE AND DEATH. HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA IS NO LONGER A MORAL ISSUE, IT'S A MORAL ISSUE IS OKAY AMERICA CANNOT BE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION ON EARTH THAT ASSETS OF EMPLOYERS TO PUT PRICE OF HEALTH CARE ON THE COST OF ITS PRODUCTS WHEN ALL OF ITS COMPETITORS AROUND THE WORLD DO NOT. IT IS NOT JUST A MORAL CRISIS, IT IS AN ECONOMIC CRISIS, AN ECONOMIC PLAN THAT WILL NOT WORK IN A 21ST CENTURY GLOBAL ECONOMY. BUSINESS KNOWS THIS. WHICH IS WHY THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE, A FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES, AT&T, INTEL, CALLIE SERVERS AND WALMART WILL BE JOINED, THEY ARE DEMANDING A NEW HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. THE PUBLIC NOW KNOWS THIS. POLLING IN THE FOUR EARLY PRIMARY STATES SHOWS THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN FOR VOTERS OF BOTH PARTIES. AND A VAST MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICAN VOTERS BELIEVE EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND THEY WANT FUNDAMENTAL, NOT PIECEMEAL CHANGE ANYMORE. GOVERNORS NOW KNOW THIS. GOV SCHWARZENEGGER AND ROMNEY, DEMOCRATS RENDELL AND VOINOVICH HAVE PLANS FOR ALL THEIR CITIZENS AS TO RON WYDEN. POLICY NOW KNOW THIS. GERTZ IS WIDE RANGING AS THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN INSURANCE INDUSTRY PROPOSED PLANS TO CALL FOR COVERAGE FOR ALL AMERICANS. SO WHAT, WHAT ARE WE MISSING? LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON D.C., AND FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT HERE IS THE FINAL PART OF OUR POLL. VOTERS ARE SAYING THEY'RE NOT HEARING FROM YOU ENOUGH ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND IN A MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO START SOLVING THE PROBLEM TOGETHER. THE WINDS OF CHANGE OF HEALTH CARE ARE BLOWING. IT IS UP TO ASK VOTERS, VOTERS TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON. TO ASK QUESTIONS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY LET'S DEMAND DETAILED ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. AMERICA'S FUTURE IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE. IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE. AND EVERY FOUR YEARS OF OUR CHOICES, VOTERS' CHOICES, REALLY DO MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] TO GUIDE US THROUGH OUR DISCUSSION TODAY IS KAREN TUMULTY, ARE MODERATOR PEW ISSUES THE NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT FOR TIME MAGAZINE, WIDELY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST POLITICAL JOURNALIST IN AMERICA. KIRAN HAS WRITTEN OVER 25 COVER STORIES, INCLUDING THIS WEEK'S. SHE WILL MANAGE AS FORUM, TAKE QUESTIONS FROM OUR INTERNET AUDIENCE AND ASK KARON QUESTIONS WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HER HERE TODAY, KAREN TUMULTY. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS REALLY EXCITING TO BE HERE AND ONCE AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR SPENDING YOUR SATURDAY MORNING WITH US. WANT TO THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF U.N.L.V., AS THE I YOU, AND THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND WHICH IS A NON-PROFIT, NON-PARTISAN ORGANIZATION, THE LAWYERS WANTED ME TO SAY THAT PART. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THESE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN COMING MONTHS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND FORUMS LIKE THIS, BUT THIS ONE IS VERY, VERY DIFFERENT. THIS MORNING YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT WHO HAS THAT THE LATEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE OR WITH THE LATEST BACK AND FORTH HIS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THIS MORNING GUESS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRILL DOWN INTO A PARTICULAR ISSUE, AND ONE THAT POLL AFTER POLL AFTER POLL SHOWS HITS HOME IN A WAY NO OTHER ISSUE DOES WITH VOTERS. HOPEFULLY, AT THE END OF THIS MORNING, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THESE CANDIDATES PRIORITIES AS THEY ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SENSE OF WHO HAS A PLAN AND WHO DOES NOT. AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SENSE ALSO OF WHOSE PLAN IS REALISTIC IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE, IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT PRESUMABLY THEY ARE GOING TO CONFRONT AS THEY TAKE OFFICE IN JANUARY OF 2009. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THESE CANDIDATES, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TAKE CARE OF A FEW HOUSEKEEPING ISSUES AND MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AS TO HOW THIS FORUM IS GOING TO WORK. FIRST OF ALL, I SHOULD NOTE THAT ALL THE CANDIDATES OF BOTH PARTIES WERE INVITED TO THIS FORUM. THESE SEVEN, ALL DEMOCRATS, ARE THE ONES WHO ACCEPTED. THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WILL BE SPEAKING THIS MORNING IS THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION. THE FORMAT IS GOING TO GO LIKE THIS: EACH CANDIDATE IS GOING TO HAVE 20 MINUTES. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO, THREE MINUTES TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT AND WE WILL SEE HOW WELL WE CAN HOLD POLITICIANS TO THAT. AND THEN OF THE REMAINING MINUTES, THE REMAINING 17 TO 18 MINUTES WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG QUESTIONS FROM MYSELF, QUESTIONS FROM THIS AUDIENCE AND QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE COMING IN OVER THE INTERNET BY E-MAIL BECAUSE THIS IS OF COURSE BEING WEBCAST, NOW WE'RE LIVING IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IF ANY OF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU NEED OR WANT TO LEAVE THE ROOM DURING ANYONE'S PRESENTATION, HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE BY YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO COME BACK UNTIL THE BREAK BEFORE THE NEXT CANDIDATE. AND I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE'RE READY TO START, SO OUR FIRST CANDIDATE, WHO I BELIEVE IS NOW IN THE BUILDING, IS THE FORMER SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA, JOHN EDWARDS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE. LET ME SAY FIRST A PERSONAL THANK-YOU TO ALL OF YOU AND TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SO KIND AND SO GENEROUS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, INCLUDING BY THE WAY, MY FELLOW CANDIDATES WHO WILL BE HERE TODAY. I'M VERY PROUD TO HAVE MY WIFE, ELISABETH, HERE WITH ME TODAY. [APPLAUSE] >> AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK KATHY AND THE SE I U FOR SPONSORING THIS FORM AND FOR TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US, TO ALL AMERICANS. WHAT WE HAVE IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WHAT WE NEED IS BIG, BOLD DRAMATIC CHANGE, NOT SMALL CHANGE. WE NEED TO NOT JUST FIX OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM, WE NEED TO FIX OUR MILITARY AND VETERANS' HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WHICH DESPERATELY NEEDS WORK, AS WE ALL ALL SEEN RECENTLY. LET ME TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT MY PLAN FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND THEN I AM SURE WE WILL GET INTO MORE DETAIL AS WE GO THROUGH THIS CONVERSATION. BASICALLY, WHAT WE DO IS COVER ALL AMERICANS. AND MY PLAN, THERE ARE SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES, THE EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER THEIR EMPLOYEES OR TO PAY INTO A FUND THAT WILL HELP PAY FOR COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. THE GOVERNMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL SET UP HEALTH-CARE MARKETS ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND IN EACH OF THOSE MARKETS, IF YOU ARE THE CONSUMER, YOU CAN GO IN AND CHOOSE WHAT YOUR HEALTH CARE PLAN WILL BE CARRIED SOME OF THE CHOICES ARE PRIVATE INSURERS AND THEN WHEN CHOICE IS A GOVERNMENT PLAN, BASICALLY A MEDICARE PLUS PLANS. THE IDEA IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AMERICANS ACTUALLY WATCHED A PRIVATE ENSURE OR WHETHER THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE GOVERNMENT RUN MEDICARE PLUS KIND OF SINGLE PAYER PLAN. AND WE WILL FIND OUT OVER TIME WHICH WHICH PEOPLE GO. THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN ALSO COVERS THE CRACKS THAT EXIST IN OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. THERE'S COMPLETE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY, COVERAGE FOR CHRONIC CARE, COVERAGE FOR PREVENTIVE CARE, COVERAGE FOR LONG-TERM CARE. WE SUBSIDIZE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. THAT CATS OUT AT ABOUT $80,000 OF INCOME A YEAR. THERE ARE HUGE COST CONTAINMENT PIECES IN THIS HEALTHCARE PLAN. THE REQUIREMENT OF PREVENTIVE CARE. WE REQUIRE BY COMPETITION, LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, SPENDING 30 TO 40 CENTS ON EACH HEALTH-CARE DOLLAR TODAY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE'RE GOING TO BRING US DOWN, BRING THEM DOWN DRAMATICALLY. WE REQUIRE AND DEMAND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY, THE USE OF ELECTRONIC RECORD-KEEPING, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND HELP BRING DOWN HEALTH-CARE COSTS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO MEASURE WHAT IS WORKING, WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT, HOW WE GET THE MOST EFFECTIVE DRUGS IN THE MOST COSTLY DRUGS. THE IDEA IS, COVER EVERYBODY, BRING DOWN HEALTH-CARE COSTS FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, WHICH THIS PLAN I BELIEVE WILL DO. FILL IN THE CRACKS IN OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. INSEL'S RESPONSIBLE PARTY BESIDES THE EMPLOYERS IN THE GOVERNMENT OR INDIVIDUALS. EVERYONE IN AMERICA WILL BE REQUIRED TO, BY LAW, TO BE COVERED BY THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN THE LASTING WILL TELL YOU IS THE COST IS 90 TO $120 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S COSTS. I PAY FOR IT BY ROLLING BACK GEORGE BUSH'S TAX CUTS FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE OVER CHANDRA THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SENATOR AND ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WEEK THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE HAD, WE STILL PERCEIVE BEING HERE AND OF COURSE EVERYONE'S BEST WISHES AND PRAYERS GO TO YOUR FAMILY AND OF COURSE TO MRS. EDWARDS. [APPLAUSE] OF ALL THE CANDIDATES THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM TODAY, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A DETAILED, SPECIFIC PLAN AS TO HOW YOU ARE GOING TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND YOU HAVE BEEN CANDID ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IT INVOLVES TAX INCREASES. BUT ONE OF THE REASONS YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT BEING SPECIFIC ON HEALTH CARE -- IF YOU ARE MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN YOU RAN IN 2004, IS THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH WITH MRS. EDWARDS ILLNESS. SO, AS YOU HAD A BIG DECISION TO MAKE THIS WEEK, HE MADE IT VERY QUICKLY. BUT AS PEOPLE LOOK AT THE SITUATION YOU ARE AND, THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE IN, THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO TO TO ALL CONSUMING THINGS HERE AT ONCE, AND THAT HOWEVER POSITIVE THE COURSE OF THIS TREATMENT TURNS OUT TO BE, THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PERSONAL UPS AND DOWNS FOR YOU OVER THE NEXT YEAR-AND-A-HALF. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE BOTH OF THOSE AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT SUPPORTING IT, ARE THINKING ABOUT CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR CAMPAIGN THAT ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF TO ALL CONSUMING THINGS AT ONE TIME? WILL YOU BE IN THIS RACE FOR THE DURATION? >> I AM DEFINITELY IN THE RACE FOR THE DURATION. WHAT SHOWS FROM OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CHALLENGE LIKE THIS THAT ELIZABETH AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. AS MANY OF DO YOU KNOW, WE LOST A SON ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO NOW. WE'VE GONE THROUGH AT ELIZABETH'S FIRST ROUND OF BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. WE WENT THROUGH THAT TOGETHER. SO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO FUNCTION IN A VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT. THERE IS A FOCUS AND IMMATURITY THAT I THINK IS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT I KNOW, BECAUSE I'VE DONE IT IN THE PAST, THAT WE CAN DO IT. I KNOW BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WOMAN I AM MARRIED TO, THE ISSUE WILL BE EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY MAKING SURE WE DO IT. AND WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVING HIS COUNTRY VERY SERIOUSLY. IT IS THE REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. AT THINK WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE'RE DOING NOW. AND WE WANT TO SERVE, BOTH OF US, WHICH IS WHY WE MADE THE DECISION TO GO FORWARD. BUT I WANT TO ADD ONE THING BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE TWO OF US. I THINK WE'RE GETTING FAR TOO MUCH CREDIT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF WOMEN, WHO HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH THE SAME SORT OF STRUGGLES THAT ELIZABETH HAS HAD, AND MANY OF THEM HAVE HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH IT WITHOUT WHAT WE HAVE, WITHOUT GREAT HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE, WITHOUT KNOWING THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL THE MEDICINE AND MEDICATIONS THAT THEY NEED. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY WOMAN AND EVERY PERSON IN AMERICA GETS THE SAME KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A WOMAN HAS TO GO THROUGH, OR ANYBODY, HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS KIND OF STRUGGLE AND HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD THE MEDICINE THEY NEED, WHETHER THEY CAN GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. AND NO AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. AS ELIZABETH SAID A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, FOR US, WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR OUR FAMILY AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT A LOT OF WOMEN WITH EXACTLY THE SAME DIAGNOSIS HAD TO GIVE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND GO TO WORK. AND THE NEXT MORNING AND GO TO WORK. SO, BEFORE WE START GETTING TOO MUCH CREDIT TO US LET'S DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR ALL WOMEN. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SENATOR. ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF YOUR PLAN HAS BEEN THAT IT IS NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH IN DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS. HE TALKED ABOUT SAVING MONEY THROUGH PREVENTIVE CARE, THROUGH USING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE THERE REALLY IS NOT BEING USED A LOT IN THE HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY. BUT RIGHT NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR AUDIENCE, JACK MARCO, WHO IS THE HONOR OF A SMALL BUSINESS, WHO WANTS TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE GOING TO -- HOW YOU ARE GOING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE KIND OF RISING HEALTH-CARE COSTS THAT HE HAS TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY AND THAT THREATEN HIS BUSINESS. JACK, ARE YOU HERE? >> I AM ALLOWED, BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED. I HAVE A BUSINESS. WE JUST COMPLETED OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS WE HAVE PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEM. EVERY YEAR BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT. BECAUSE IN THIS PROCESS, WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO TALKING ABOUT WAGES, WE HAD TO OFFER LAST AND THE EMPLOYEES HAD TO ACCEPT LESS THAN THEY WOULD LIKE OR WE'D LIKE TO GET BECAUSE OF THE MONEY WE HAD TO PAY AND HEALTH CARE. AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE TO COMPETE IN AN INDUSTRY WITH PEOPLE DOING THE SAME KIND OF BUSINESS IDEA. THE COST I HAVE FOR MY 75 EMPLOYES CONFIRM -- MEANS I HAVE TO CHARGE HIGHER FEES FOR THE SERVICES I PROVIDE AND LIKEWISE I HAVE TO PROVIDE -- I CAN ONLY PROVIDE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF WAGES THAT PERHAPS COMPETITOR COULD PROVIDE MORE. MY QUESTION IS AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO TO TAKING CARE OF THIS COMPETITIVE PROBLEM. >> CITY OF 75 EMPLOYES? >> RIGHT. >> I THINK THIS PLAN DEALS DIRECTLY WITH THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE. WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE THIS ISSUE, NOT ONLY BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR COMPETITORS HERE IN AMERICA WE HAVE A HUGE COMPETITIVE IN THIS ISSUE BETWEEN OUR BUSINESSES IN AMERICA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH CARE COSTS, WHICH ARE DEALING WITH EVERY SINGLE YEAR IN THE OPERATION OF YOUR BUSINESS. THOSE COSTS HAVE TO COME DOWN. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, WHAT WE WANT PHYSICALLY HAVE A TRULY UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT COVERS EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN FROM THE TIME THEY'RE BORN UNTIL THE TIME THEY DIE, IT MAKES AMERICAN BUSINESS MORE COMPETITIVE IN THE WORLD. WE'RE SPENDING 17 TO $1,800 EVERY -- COMPARED TO $250 JAPAN COULD AGREE TO A HUGE DISADVANTAGE. WHAT THIS PLAN SPECIFICALLY DOES FOR YOUR SITUATION IS, IT GIVES YOU MARKET POWER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TODAY. INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE NO MARKET POWER AND AS A RESULT YOU PAY EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH CARE COSTS. SO WHAT WE DO WHEN HE SAID THAT THESE HEALTH CARE MARKETS IS WE CREATE THE SAME MARKET POWER FOR YOU THAT EXISTS FOR THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. THESE MARKETS WILL REQUIRE COMPETITIVE BIDDING TO GET INTO THE MARKETS AND THEY'RE ALL SO THESE PRIVATE INSURERS THAT WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH A GOVERNMENT PLAN, WITH EXTRAORDINARY LOW ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, TO TWO MAKAR% IN ALL LIKELIHOOD. THAT COMPETITION WILL BRING DOWN COSTS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THESE THINGS KAREN MADE MENTION OF, USE A TECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONIC RECORD-KEEPING, PREVENTIVE CARE, MANDATORY PREVENTATIVE CARE SO THAT WERE HEALTHY -- HEALTHCARE AND WE ARE A WELL PEOPLE. WILL BRING DOWN POLICY FOR EVERYBODY. I THINK SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE FOR YOU IS, WE WILL BRING DOWN HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS ON HOLD FOR WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO PAY. SECOND, YOUR COST DIRECTLY WILL BE LOWER BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A LEVEL OF COMPETITION THAT DOES NOT EXIST TODAY AND YOU'LL HAVE A MARKET POWER THAT IS NOT EXIST TODAY. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT, BESIDES THE UNINSURED, WHO I THINK WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO, BESIDES THE UNINSURED THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN ARE INDIVIDUALS AND SMALLER BUSINESSES. I THINK YOU ARE THE GREATEST BENEFICIARY OF THIS PLAN. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, THE HEALTH-CARE PROBLEM HAS BEEN WITH US VERY A VERY LONG TIME. THE LAST TIME A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ADDRESS IT, IT NEVER EVEN GOT TO A VOTE ON THE FLOOR IN EITHER HOUSE OF CONGRESS BECAUSE OF SOME MONEY FRONTS OF OPPOSITION. OF THOSE, THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK AND THE STRONGEST WAS BUSINESS. SO WE HAVE A QUESTION COMING IN OVER E-MAIL FROM MARY ANN ELEANORA, WHO WANTS TO KNOW, DO YOU HAVE A STRATEGY FOR ENGAGING AMERICAN BUSINESSES IN ACHIEVING HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE FOR ALL AMERICANS? >> YES, BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE AMERICAN BUSINESS COMPETITIVE, BRING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE NOT IS FOR INDIVIDUALS, WHICH WE DO, BUT ALSO FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS. SO THIS PLAN DOES ALL THOSE THINGS. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF A SMALL BUSINESS BUT IT ACTUALLY APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESSES. WHAT HAPPENS IS, BECAUSE THEIR HUGE COST CONTAINMENT ELEMENTS IN THIS PLAN WHICH WILL NOT GO THROUGH AGAIN, AND BECAUSE WE'RE SUBSIDIZING HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES, THIS IS THE EFFECT OF BRINGING DOWN HEALTH-CARE COSTS FOR ALL BUSINESSES. TSE I YOU HAD AND IN EASTERN HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE A FEW WEEKS AGO WITH SOME VERY LARGE AMERICAN BUSINESSES, WHO WERE COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING. AND I BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY AMERICAN BUSINESSES NOW HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, THAT IT IS MAKING THEM INCREASINGLY UNCOMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. AND UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, THEN THE RIGHT WAY, WITH THE RIGHT CHOICES AND THE RIGHT EFFICIENCIES, WILL ACTUALLY HELP AMERICAN BUSINESS, NOT JUST HELP THE 47 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. >> WELL THEY'RE GOING TO BE CANDIDATES TO COME OUT HERE TODAY, WHO SUGGEST IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS, TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WITHOUT RAISING TAXES. WITHOUT NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE. YOU HAVE BEEN VERY UP-FRONT ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE NORPLANT DOES INVOLVE TAX INCREASES. IF YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET THERE WITHOUT THEM? >> NO, I DO NOT HIT WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WORKING WITH ECONOMISTS AROUND THE WORLD. I'VE SPENT MANY MONTHS ON THIS. IT PLANNED THIS -- MY PLAN CAN ADD A FEW WEEKS AGO. I'VE SPENT A GREAT AND DEAL OF TIME WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU COULD HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE WITHOUT FINDING A SOURCE OF REVENUE. THERE HAS TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF REVENUE. WE DON'T GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR FREE. YOU HAVE TO COVER 47 MILLION PEOPLE, THE DON'T HAVE COVERAGE. THERE'S ONE TO THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION FROM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY TO A TRULY UNIVERSAL AND MORE EFFICIENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO NO, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT FINDING AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF REVENUE AND THE JOKE I ALWAYS MAKE ABOUT IT IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HEARD SO MANY POLITICIANS FOR SO LONG SAY, ALL WERE RIGHT TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, TRANSFORM THE WAY WE USE ENERGY IN AMERICA, AND POVERTY IN AMERICA AND IN THE PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT. THEY'VE PROBABLY GOT A BRIDGE IN BROOKLYN THAT WANT TO SELL YOU TOO. I JUST DON'T THINK IT CAN BE DONE AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT, LIKE I SAY ONE LAST THING ABOUT THIS, I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE NINE STATES BE HONEST WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE OPEN AND HONEST. [APPLAUSE] AND I ALSO THINK THAT HONESTY STARTS RIGHT HERE IN THE CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] >> AS YOU WERE PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR HEALTH CARE PLAN, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF BASING YOUR HEALTH COVERAGE ON WHERE YOU WORK IS JUST AN ANACHRONISM. IS A HISTORICAL ACCIDENT. YOU, HOWEVER, CHOSE TO BUILD ON THAT SYSTEM. WHY IS IT THAT YOU DID NOT COME AS SOME PEOPLE SUGGESTED, WHY DO REJECT THE IDEA OF A GOVERNMENT-RUN MEDICARE FOR EVERYBODY, OR SOME OTHER FORM OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD, AGAIN, GET RID OF A SYSTEM THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A HISTORICAL ACCIDENT? .. I THINK WE CAN GET SUPPORT ACROSS THE POLITICAL SBEK TRUMP AND WE'LL ACCOMPLISH A LOT OF WHAT HE WANT TO DO. SECOND, IT DOES GIVE PEOPLE CHOICE AND I THINK AMERICANS HAVE BECOME AWE CUSTOM TO HAVING CHOICE AND I THINK THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT THEIR HEALTHCARE PLAN IS. NOW, IT MATE BE THAT THIS GRAVITATES TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYOR PLAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE MEDICARE SINGLE PLUS CHOICE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THE WHOLE SYSTEM COULD GO IN THAT DIRECTION. YOU'LL DID HE SIDE THAT. CONSUMERS WILL DECIDE THAT. I THINK ACTUALLY THIS IS -- THIS PLAN MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF MOVING US FORWARD, GETTING OUR UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE PLAN IN PLACE, GIVING PEOPLE THE CHOICE OF THE EQUIVALENT OF A SINGLE PAYOR PLAN WITH MEDICARE PLUS. THEN WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE. >> I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION FROM THE AUDIENCE AND THIS IS A SUBJECT VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO SCU MEMBERS. AN RN FROM DESERT SPRING HOSPITAL. HAVE YOU HERE? >> HI REGGIE WARNER, A NURSE AT UCS DESERT SPRINGS HOSPITAL. I SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO PATIENTS EVERY DAY IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF SHORT STAFFING, AND I ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO NURSES WHO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF JOB BURNOUT AND OVERALL DISSATISFACTION. WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING FOR SAFE STAFFING AND NURSE RETENTION. >> WELL, WE HAVE A HUGE NURSING CRISES IN AMERICA WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW ABOUT FIRST HAND. I THINK A PART OF THAT CRISES IS DEALT WITH BY ACHIEVING A TRULY UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, WHERE EVERYONE GETS REIMBURSED AT A FAIR RATE FOR THE SERVICES THEY'RE PROVIDING AND IN THE CONTEST OF ACHIEVING THIS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WE CAN REGULATE IT IN A WAY THAT STAFFING BE ADEQUATE. YOU KNOW, NURSES ARE WORKING EXTRAORDINARY -- NURSES WHO WERE THE PRIMARY CARE GIVERS CERTAINLY IN A HOSPITAL SETTING, THEY SPEND A LOT MORE TIME WITH THE PATIENT THAN PHYSICIANS DO. IN MANY CASES, THEY'RE STRESSED, THEY'RE WORKING LONG HOURS AND THEY'RE TERRIFIED, AS YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I HEAR EVERY TIME I TALK TO A NURPS, THEY'VE AFRAID THAT THE RESULTS OF ALL THIS IS THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A MISTAKE. AND THE PATIENT'S GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO SUFFERS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO, IN ADDITION TO HAVING A TRULY UNIVERSAL SYSTEM, IN ADDITION TO REGULATING IN A WAY TO KEEP STAFFING WHICH IS EASIER TO ESTABLISH IN A UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE AS A NATION NEED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO BEEF UP OUR AVAILABILITY OF NURSES, WHICH MEANS MORE INVESTMENT, MORE SCHOLARSHIP IN NURSING SCHOOLS. IT MEAN INDIVIDUALING AN INCENTIVE TO GET NURSES WHO ARE GRADUATING TO PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED THE MOST, WHERE NURSING SHORTAGE IS MOST SEVERE. IN OTHER WORDS INCENTIVE PAY, SO HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP ATTRACT NURSES TO GO TO THE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED THE MOST. AND THEN CREATE A WORKING ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS NURSES TO BE THE PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY WANT TO BE. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT'S OUR TIME, SENATOR EDWARDS. AND AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND BEST WISHES GOING TOWARD. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR JOHN EDWARDS WITH HIS 340E7B8, WALKING OFF THE STAGE MEETING HIS WIFE AND WALKING OUT OF THE AUDITORIUM. >> THIS IS A NEIGHBOR, HE'S GOVERNOR BILL RICHARDSON OF NEW MEXICO. [APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO THANK SCIU AND THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS FOR PUTTING THIS EVENT TOGETHER. MY FIRST THOUGHTS AND BARBARA, MY WIFE'S FIRST THOUGHTS TODAY ARE FOR ELIZABETH EDWARDS AND THE EDWARDS FAMILY IN THIS VERY TRYING TIMES. [APPLAUSE] IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE, IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE ABOUT A POLICY MESSAGE RELATING TO THIS SITUATION IS THAT AS AMERICANS, WE SHOULD SPEND MORE AND INVEST MORE IN CANCER RESEARCH, IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND MANY OF OUR ENTITIES THAT ARE UNDER FUNDED AND WITH FLAT BUDGETS. WE SHOULD INVEST MORE IN STEM CELL RESEARCH. WE SHOULD FIND WAYS TO INVEST IN THE DISEASES IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WE AS AMERICANS ARE IN CRISES TODAY. AS A GOVERNOR, I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTHCARE CRISES EVERY DAY. WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH INCREASING ACCESS COVERAGE AND CONTROLLING COSTS. SINCE THE YEAR 2000, HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES BY 80%. 4,000 AMERICANS LOSE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE EVERY DAY. WE SPENT $2 TRILLION ON HEALTHCARE. 31% OF HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE SPENT ON BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE INSTEAD OF DIRECT HERE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DEVISE A STRATEGY -- FIRST OF ALL, THAT DOESN'T CREATE ANY MORE BUREAUCRACIES. WE HAVE ENOUGH BUREAUCRACIES. AS A GOVERNOR, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL COSTS. I'VE EVEN CUT TAXES FOR WORKING FAMILIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, EXPANDED COVERAGE. SO WHAT WOULD I DO AS A PRESIDENT? FIRST, TO DEAL WITH INCREASING COVERAGE. NUMBER ONE. ALL AMERICANS AND ALL BUSINESSES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME COVERAGE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO DO THAT AND WE CAN DO THAT. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD START SOMETHING NEW. AMERICANS 55 AND OLDER SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICARE. TODAY IT'S AT 65. [APPLAUSE] NUMBER THREE, A TRADE, AND THIS IS HOW A GOVERNOR WOULD OPERATE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, MEDICARE GOES TO TREAT SENIORS AND THE DISABLED, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE STATE DEALING AN INCREASING MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND NUMBER FOUR, VETERANS. WE SHOULD GIVE OUR MILITARY VETERANS THE ACCESS THEY NEED ANYWHERE THEY WANT, ANY TIME THEY WANT. [APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD HAVE A HERO'S HEALTH CARD THAT WOULD ENABLE OUR VETERANS WHEN THEY GET OUT, TO GET COVERAGE, CHOICES ANYWHERE THEY WANT. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DRIVE 200 MILES TO THE NEAREST VA HOSPITAL. NOW, THIS IS HOW I WOULD DEAL WITH COVERAGE. WHAT ABOUT COSTS? I WOULD HAVE A COOPERATIVE PLAN BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER, BUSINESSES, THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WOULD PROPOSE A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE AMERICANS THAT NEED COVERAGE BASED ON INCOME. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD CLAMP DOWN ON CREDIT CARD COMPANIES THAT ARE COVERING EXCESSIVE INTEREST RATER COSTS. -- INTEREST RATE COSTS. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE A SECRETARY WHOSE BROTHER IS PAYING 18%. THAT'S FOR HEALTHCARE ON CREDIT CARDS. 18% INTEREST RATE. I WOULD PUT A CAP ON THOSE COSTS. I WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PREVENTION STRATEGY. EARLY PREVENTION, KIDS. AS GOVERNOR, I ELIMINATED JUNK FOOD IN SCHOOLS. [APPLAUSE] I JUST SIGNED A STATE-WIDE SMOKING BAN AND I WOULD THAT AS PRESIDENT. I WOULD HAVE A PROMOTION OF HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE, IMPACT CREDIT TO COMPANIES THAT ENCOURAGE THEIR WORKERS TO BE HEALTHIER, TO EXERCISE. I WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH 31% OF EXCESSIVE HEALTHCARE COSTS AND BUREAUCRACY BY ELECTRONIC RECORDS. I WOULD ALSO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER -- HOW DO WE PAY FOR THIS? THIS IS HOW I WOULD PAY FOR THIS HEALTHCARE PLAN. NUMBER ONE, WE REORDER PRIORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. WE GET OUT OF IRAQ AND PUT THE $400 BILLION WE HAVE IN IRAQ AND SHIFT IT TO HUMAN NEEDS. [APPLAUSE] NUMBER TWO, WE SPENT TWO TRILLION ON HEALTHCARE. WE SHIFT AND REORDER PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF REDUCING INEFFICIENCIES IN OUR SYSTEM. AND NUMBER THREE, WE WOULD OFFER OPTIONS FOR ALL AMERICANS TO GET HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, WORKERS MUST GET HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. BUT YOU HELP THEM IF THEY NEED IT. AND BUSINESSES, AND SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN HEALTHCARE PLANS FOR ALL THOSE EMPLOYEES. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. THIS IS A PLAN THAT WOULD NOT ADD BUREAUCRACY. THIS IS A PLAN THAT COULD BE PAID FOR WITHOUT ANY NEW TAXES. THIS IS A PLAN I BELIEVE THAT SAYS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IF I HAVE A HEALTHCARE PLAN AND I'M SATISFIED WITH IT, I CAN KEEP IT THE WAY IT IS. I BELIEVE ALSO THAT AS AMERICANS, WE HAVE TO ENSURE PREVENTION. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. MAKING SURE THAT WE START EARLY, MAKING SURE THAT WE PROMOTE HEALTHIER LIFE-STYLES. THAT WOULD BE MY PLAN AS PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] >> GOVERNOR, I'M AFRAID IF YOU'RE ATTACKING JUNK FOOD, YOU'RE ALREADY LOST MY TEN-YEAR-OLD'S VOTE. [LAUGHTER] HOW QUICKLY UNDER YOUR PLAN DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET TO TRUE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE? >> I BELIEVE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, A STRONGER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, I BELIEVE THIS PLAN THAT I OUTLINE WHICH IS BASICALLY A PLAN THAT IS TAKING NEW IDEAS INTO AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK COULD BE ACHIEVED MY FIRST YEAR AS PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE IT'S DOABLE. I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A SHIFT IN-LAWS. FOR INSTANCE, TRADING, THE FEDERAL ROLE IN MEDICARE, THE STATE ROLE IN MEDICAID FOR S CHIP IN CHILDREN. I BELIEVE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOO IS WITHIN THE COST STRUCTURE. WHEN YOU'RE SPENDING TWO TRILLION ON HEALTHCARE, REMEMBER THERE ARE 47 MILLION UNINSURED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WHEN WE'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR IT. IT'S ALREADY BEING PAID FOR. THEY'RE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR THIS. SO IT'S A QUESTION OF SHIFTING PRIORITIES. SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS, I BELIEVE, A VERY AGGRESSIVE PLAN, WITH NEW IDEAS THAT COULD YOU BE ACHIEVED THE FIRST YEAR THAT I'M PRESIDENT. >> AS WASHINGTON HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, YOU AND YOUR FELLOW GOVERNORS HAS MOVED FORWARD AND STEPPED INTO THE BREACH. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSY ASPECTS OF THE PLAN THAT GOVERNOR SCHWARZNEGGER JUST RECENTLY UNVEILED IN CALIFORNIA IS HIS PROPOSAL THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BE COVERED UNDER HIS PLAN. HOW WOULD YOU SEE UNDER YOUR PLAN BRINGING THIS VERY VERY LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION INTO THE SYSTEM OR NOT. >> THEY'RE CHILDREN. WE SHOULD COVER CHILDREN. WE SHOULD COVER CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] AS LONG AS THEY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF MY PLAN IS THAT WE ALL PAY, EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES, THE GOVERNMENT. BUT WE HELP EACH OTHER PAY THE FAIR SHARE. THE WAY YOU DEAL WITH IMMIGRATION, ONE, YES, WE HAVE TO SECURE OUR BORDERS, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. NOT WITH THIS STUPID WALL THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED. [APPLAUSE] BUT YOU ALSO SET UP, YOU ALSO SET UP A LEGALIZATION PLAN FOR THE 12 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS THAT ARE IN THIS COUNTRY. MAYBE IT'S NOT VERY POPULAR, BUT IT MAKES SENSE BASED ON SETTING A PATH OF LEGALIZATION THAT INVOLVES DEALING WITH ISSUES LIKE HEALTHCARE THAT INVOLVE, IF THEY LEARN ENGLISH, IF THEY PAY BACK TAXES, IF THEY PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, THEY DON'T GET AHEAD OF THE LINE OF THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET HERE LEGAL. THESE ARE CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD INSURE ALL CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY. >> WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM DAVID SLATER IN OUR AUDIENCE WHO HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT THE KIND OF HEALTHCARE THAT CONGRESS GETS AND WARRANTS TO KNOW WHY HE CAN'T HAVE IT TOO. [LAUGHTER] . [APPLAUSE] >> THE GOVERNOR BROUGHT UP EXACTLY MY QUESTION. EXACTLY MY QUESTION TO CONGRESS, SENATORS, STAFF, POSTAL WORKERS ARE IN GREAT PLAN SPONSORED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WAS IN THAT PLAN, I'M A RETIRED POSTAL WORKER. IT'S A FABULOUS PLAN, WHY REINVENT THE WHEEL. WE HAVE AN EXISTING SYSTEM THAT CAN FUNCTION. WE DON'T NEED BUREAUCRACY AS YOU MENTION, JUST IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN TO EVERYBODY HERE IN THIS ROOM. EVERYBODY THAT'S A U.S. CITIZEN TO HAVE THE SAME PLAN AS SENATOR EDWARDS SAID, HE'S COMFORTABLE. EVERY FEDERAL WORK HE WERE IS VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR PLAN. EVERY POSTAL WORKER HAS THAT PLAN. THEY HAVE AN OPTION TO PICK FROM ANY INSURANCE COMPANY THEY WANT. WHY NOT JUST GIVE IT TO THE UNITED STATES CITIZENS RIGHT NOW AND THE GOVERNOR SAYS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN ONE YEAR. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT'S THE CORNERSTONE OF MY PLAN THAT DEALS WITH COVERAGE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT, THEY GET THE BEST PLAN IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF OPTIONS. WHAT I'M SAYING IS OFFER THAT TO EVERY AMERICAN TO EVERY BUSINESS, TO EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY IN THAT FEDERAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. AN EXCELLENT QUESTION, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> WE ALSO HAVE A QUESTION BY E-MAIL FROM KEN IN OLYMPIA WASHINGTON WHO WANTS TO KNOW HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO HAS PREPARED YOU TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. IF I COULD JUST ADD ON TO THAT, COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU LEARNED -- WHAT PARTS OF THE PROBLEM, THE HEALTHCARE PROBLEM IN DEALING WITH IT IN NEW MEXICO TURNED OUT TO BE HARDER TO CONFRONT THAN YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE. >> AS A CEO OF A STATE, GOVERNORS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE EVERY DAY. AND THE MOST I BELIEVE INNOVATIVE EXPERIMENTS ARE HAPPENING TO COVER ALL OUR PEOPLE AND ALSO CONTROL COSTS. AS A GOVERNOR, MY APPROACH HAS BEEN -- AND MY STATE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST UNINSURED. IT'S ABOUT 20-21%. 10% OF THOSE ARE NATIVE AMERICANS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE COVERED BY A FEDERAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, AND THEY'RE NOT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABDICATING SO WE TRY TO HIM WITH STATE RUN PROGRAMS. WE TRY TO DO WHAT WE DO IN THE STATES. I STARTED OUT WITH A HEALTHCARE PLAN DEALING WITH THIS AHCCCS ISSUE. NUMBER ONE, WE WERE ABLE TO INSURE ALL CHILDREN UNDER FIVE. NOW WE'RE TRYING TO COVER ALL WORKING ADULTS. THE NEXT PHASE WILL BE WE WILL TRY TO COVER THE CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED. BUT WE HAVE ATTACKED THE PREVENTION ISSUE AGGRESSIVELY AS I MENTIONED. WE CUT JUNK FOOD OUT OF SCHOOLS. I SIGNED RECENTLY LAST WEEK A STATE-WIDE SMOKING BAN. WE SHOULD NATIONALLY GIVE INCENTIVES TO COMPANIES THAT GIVE THEIR HEALTHCARE WORKERS TIME TO EXERCISE OR AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A HEALTHIER LIFE-STYLE. WE SHOULD FIND WAYS ALSO THAT IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM, WE ENCOURAGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO START EARLIER. EARLY CHILDHOOD, PRESCHOOL. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTERS AT ALL OUR SCHOOLS. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE RESEARCH. IT'S GOING TO TAKE EFFORTS, AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH MALARIA, TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT RELATE TO SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR CHILDREN. TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT RELATE ALSO FOR CHILDREN THAT HAVE SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. IN PREVENTION, WE SPEND 75% OF HEALTHCARE COSTS ON CHRONIC DISEASES AND ONLY 5% ON PREVENTION. THAT SHOULD SHIFT. [APPLAUSE]. >> WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM A MEMBER IN THE OFFICE TRACY POWELL WHO WORKS FOR THE FAMILY SERVICES IN CLARK COUNTY AND IS REALLY ON THE FRONT LINES EVERY DAY OF SEEING ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE HEALTHCARE CRISES. >> GOOD MORNING. I AM A SOCIAL WORKER FOR CLARK COUNTY DEPARTMENT FAMILY SERVICES AND I'M A MEMBER OF SEIU. WE HAVE HOW HEALTH SERVICES AND ABUSE ISSUES IMPACT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. TYPICALLY THESE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH. HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CARE PROVIDED AND COVERAGE PROVIDED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES? [APPLAUSE] >> WELL, FOR YEARS, MENTAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN GIVEN LOWER PRIORITY IN HEALTHCARE THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER PROBLEM. ONE OUT OF FIVE AMERICANS HAVE HEALTH PROBLEM INCLUDING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND DEPRESSION. IN TERMS OF INSURANCE AND COVERAGE WE'VE KNOW GLIK THE MENTAL HEALTH. AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD NOT DO THAT. WHAT WE DO IN NEW MEXICO IS WE BROUGHT ALL MENTAL HEALTH BUREAUCRACY PROGRAMS UNDER ONE ROOF INTO WHAT IS CALLED THE MENTAL HEALTH ELABORATIVE. WE NEED TO FIND WAYS ALSO THAT WE DEAL WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. YOU MENTIONED IN NEW MEXICO IN THE WEST, IN NEVADA RIGHT HERE, METH IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN BEST TREAT IT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE, MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, ALCOHOLISM, WHAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INCARCERATION BUT TREATMENT AND EDUCATION. AN INVESTMENT IN SERIOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS THAT CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> GOVERNOR, DOES THAT SURGEON THAT YOU SUPPORT FULL PARITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE. YOUR SENIOR SENATOR OF YOUR STATE, PETE HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON THAT VERY SUBJECT. OPPONENTS SAY LOOK, THIS IS GOING TO -- TALK ABOUT RISING COSTS BUT COSTS WOULD JUST EXPLODE IF IN FACT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE COVERED THE SAME WAY AS PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES. >> I WOULD INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, YES, I WOULD. BUT SEE, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT COSTS. WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF WE MANAGE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENTLY, ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE DUPLICATION. JUST THINK, 31% OF OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS IS BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE, AND IT'S NOT DIRECT CARE. IF WE FIND WAYS TO MAKE THAT MORE EFFICIENT WITH PERHAPS ELECTRONIC RECORDS, WITH, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE 50 STATES MANAGING 50 MEDICAID PROGRAMS. YOU'VE GOT A MEDICARE SYSTEM THAT HAS HUNDREDS OF HEALTHCARE PLANS ADMINISTERING IT. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND AN ELIMINATION OF THAT BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE AND MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT, YOU WOULD HAVE THAT 31% GO MORE TO DIRECT CARE. SO THOSE THAT SAY YOU NEED TO INCREASE THE TAX, YOU NEED TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE, I BELIEVE WE REQUEST DO IT WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND COVER ALL AMERICANS AND CONTROL COSTS AND BE FAIR. ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN IS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE PART OF IT. EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A COOPERATIVE COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. CATIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN A FEW YEARS. I BELIEVE IT'S DOABLE. [APPLAUSE] . >> I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION. AND THAT WOULD BE -- SO YOU PROPOSE BASICALLY BUILDING ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. AND ATTACKING THIS PROBLEM FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. WHICH ONE DO YOU DO FIRST? >> YOU HAVE TO DO THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. YOU HAVE TO EXPAND COST AND EXPAEND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. I PROPOSED, AS YOU SAID, SOME NEW IDEAS WITHIN AN EXISTING SYSTEM. THE NEW IDEAS ARE THE TRADE BETWEEN MEDICARE AND MEAD INDICATED. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATES DO SPEND MONEY ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THE NEW INITIATIVE WOULD BE WITH THIS GENTLEMEN PROPOSED AND THAT IS LED ALL AMERICANS, BUSINESSES, FAMILIES BE PART OF THE FEDERAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT THE CONGRESS ENJOYS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIZABLE POPULATION. GIVE THEM ACCESS. ANYWHERE THEY WANT TO GO. IF IT'S TWO BLOCKS FROM THEIR HOME, THEY HAVE TO DRIVE MILES AND MILES. THIS IS ALL NEW WITHIN AN EXISTING SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY, JUST FIND WAYS TO INSURE THAT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP. I'M A GOVERNOR. IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO GET WAIVERS TO DO SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THE SCIEU TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE BUREAUCRACY STRATEGIALS OUR SYSTEM SO MUCH THAT A MAJOR COMPONENT HAS TO BE A WAY TO TAME THE BUREAUCRACY SO THAT IT WORKS FOR PEOPLE AND NOT AGAINST PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GOVERNOR RICHARDSON. . [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. [APPLAUSE] . >> THAT IS NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR BILL RICHARDSON FINISHING UP THESE 20 MINUTES HERE AT THE HEALTHCARE FORUM. RICHARDSON'S PLAN FOCUSES HEAVILY ON EARLY PREVENTION. WE'RE NOW WAITING FOR THE NEXT SPEAKER. >> THE NEXT SPEAKER WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THIS MORNING IS ILLINOIS SENATOR BARAK OBAMA. . [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) >> THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYBODY. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING TO SPONSOR THIS, THANKS TO CAPS FOR THE OUTSTANDING WORK YOU DO. BUT MOST OF ALL THANKS TO SEIU. [CHEERS] I'VE GOT A HISTORY WITH THIS UNION. WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ORGANIZER THAT HAD JUST MOVED TO CHICAGO, I STARTED WORKING WITH SCEIU LOCAL 880 HOME HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE REGISTERED TO VOTE AND HAD A SAY IN THE POLITICS IN ILLINOIS. WHEN I WENT TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE, I WORKED WITH TOM BALLONOFF TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN WHO DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE GOT -- RECEIVED IT AND WE MADE SURE THAT HOSPITALS HAD TO REPORT ON THE QUALITY OF CARE AND THE STAFFING RATIOS THAT THEY HAD SET UP. AND NOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS, NOT JUST SOME AMERICANS ARE ALLOWED TO PROSPER. BUT THE THING THAT I APPRECIATE MOST ABOUT SCEIU IS YOU GUYS RECOGNIZE THAT WORLD IS NOT STANDING STILL. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THE VALUES THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AND WE HAVE TO ADAPT THEM TO NEW TIMES. WE KNOW WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE BECAUSE OF GLOBALIZATION, BECAUSE OF AUTOMATION. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS INCREASINGLY A SITUATION IN WHICH THE BENEFITS OF THIS NEW ECONOMY ACCRUED TO JUST SOME AND LEFT TOO MANY BEHIND. WAGES, SALARIES, AND BENEFITS ARE DIMINISHED. THE MESSAGE WE'VE HEARD OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS IS YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. THE TROUBLES, THE DIFFICULTIES, THE BURDENS OF GLOBALIZATION ARE GOING TO BE PLACED ON THE BACKS OF WORKERS. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN ANOTHER VISION THAT SAYS WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER AND THAT THE BURDENS AND BENEFITS OF THIS NEW ECONOMY HAVE TO BE SPREAD EVENLY ACROSS THE ECONOMY. NO WHERE DO WE SEE THAT MORE THAN IN THE ISSUE OF HEALTHCARE. EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THE STATISTICS. WE AS A NATION SPEND $2 TRILLION EVERY YEAR, MORE THAN ANY NATION ON WORTH, AND YET WE STILL HAVE 47 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED, 9 MILLION CHILDREN WHO ARE UNINSURED. WE'VE GOT FAMILIES WHO ARE BEING BANKRUPTED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RISING COSTS, AND WE'VE GOT BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING RENDERED UNCOMPETITIVE BECAUSE OF THESE RISING COSTS. NOW EVERYBODY ON THIS STAGE IS GOING TO HAVE A PLAN TO MOVE THIS HEALTHCARE DEBATE FORWARDAS TO HOW I WOULD APPROACH THE BASIC PRINCIPAL BY THE END OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT'S FIRST TERM, BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IN THE UNITED STATES. . >> EVERY FOUR YEARS WE HEAR SOMEBODY HAS GOT A HEALTH CARE PLAN CARRIED EVERY FOUR YEARS SOMEBODY TROTS OUT ON WHITE PAPER, THEY POSTED ON THE WEB. BUT THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES IS, DO WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL AND THE SENSE OF URGENCY TO ACTUALLY GET IT DONE? I WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR GETTING IT DONE. I WILL JUDGE MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT BASED ON THE FACT ON WHETHER WE HAVE DELIVERED THE KIND OF HEALTH CARE THAT EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES AND THAT OUR SYSTEM CAN AFFORD IT. I'M NOT GOING TO BE WILL TO DO IT ON MY OWN CY HOEKE SEIU AND SUPPING A PARTNER IN THE PROCESS. THANKS EVERYBODY. >> THINK HE CENTER. YOU GAVE A SPEECH IN JANUARY, WHERE YOU SAID THAT THE TIME FOR HALF STEPS AND THE TIME FOR HALF MEASURES AND HEALTH CARE IS OVER WITH. BUT THUS FAR, WE HAVE NOT SEEN A PLAN FROM YOU GET, AND SO I'M GOING TO TURN MY FIRST QUESTION OVER TO MORGAN MILLER, WHO WENT ON THE WEBSITE LOOKING FOR SOME SPECIFIC ANSWERS AND DID NOT FIND THEM. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO ASK YOU THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS NOW. MORGAN. >> WHERE IS MORGAN? IS MORGAN OVER HERE? HI. MORGAN. >> AS MANY AMERICANS I WOULD HONOR WEBSITES TO FIND SOME INFORMATION ABOUT YOU, AND ALL I SAW WHEN IT CAME TO ADDRESSING THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE WAS THINGS LIKE HIV, WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND ISSUES LIKE LEAD POISONING. SO I WAS WONDERING, WHAT REALLY ARE YOUR TOP ISSUES WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE? ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS THIS INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLINE. >> KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR CAMPAIGN NOW IS I THINK A LITTLE OVER EIGHT WEEKS OLD, AND SO WE WILL BE PUTTING A VERY DETAILED PLAN ON OUR WEBSITE. ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE OF IS -- I'M NOT SURE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE CAMPAIGN WEBSITE OR MISSENT WEBSITE. WE HAVE NOT TRANSITIONED ALL THAT INFORMATION FOR MERSON IT WEB SITE TO THE CAMPAIGN WEBSITE. BUT AS AS I INDICATED BEFORE MY COMMITMENT IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT. THERE ARE SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES THAT THIS PLAN WILL HAVE. NUMBER ONE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS IN. NUMBER TWO, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE APPLY SOME PRINCIPLES THAT I THINK EVERY EXPERT AGREES TO IN TERMS OF HOW WE SAVE MONEY AND GET MORE OUT OF THE DOLLAR'S WHERE ARE SPENDING. FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE GOT TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO PREVENTION. IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR CHILDREN TO BE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR TREATABLE AILMENTS LIKE ASTHMA. AND IF WE'RE GIVING THEM A REGULAR CHECKUPS WITH THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, THEN WHERE WE TO SAVE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM. 20% OF OUR PATIENTS WHO HAVE CHRONIC ILLNESSES ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE COSTS. AND SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE INVEST IN MANAGING THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES LIKE DIABETES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE HIRE A CASE MANAGER TO WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE THEY'RE TAKING THE PROPER TREATMENT, THEN POTENTIALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND $30,000 ON A LEG AMPUTATION IT THERE DIABETIC. APPLICATIONS OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY CAN NOT ONLY REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, BUT COULD ALSO IMPROVE QUALITY. AND REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS. WE'RE PLEDGE AT TO TAKE THE SAVINGS AND APPLY THEM TO THOSE PERSONS WHO CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE SO THAT THEY CAN BUY INTO THE SYSTEM SO WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THEM IN SOME FASHION. ANOTHER PRINCIPLE IS IS THAT IS COY TO HAVE TO BE SOME FORM OF POOLING OF COSTS AND RISKS IN THEIR ROOM TO BE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS OUT THERE. I HEARD IT IN SOME OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT ONE POOL WOULD BE THE FEDERAL PULL THE PARTY EXISTS FOR MYSELF AND OTHER FEDERAL WORKERS. SOME STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS ARE DECIDING TO SET UP THEIR POOLS. WHATEVER THE MECHANISM WHEREBY TO HAVE TO HAVE A COOLING SYSTEM SO THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE BENEFITS OF BEING PART OF A LARGER GROUP. THE FINAL THING I WILL MENTION IS WERE I TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SERIOUS ABOUT QUALITY AND HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY. NOT ONLY TO WE HAVE TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO PREVENTION, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE, IF A GENERIC WORKS JUST AS WELL AS A BRAND NAME DRUG, THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWING DRUG COMPANIES TO DICTATE WHAT IS ON THE FORMULARY, WHAT DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER A PLAN. BUT MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS SPENT ON THE MOST EFFICIENT DRUG FOR THAT PARTICULAR DISEASE. IF WE DO ALL THOSE THINGS, I BELIEVE THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T AND UP WITH A KIND OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS HIGH-QUALITY BASIC HEALTH CARE. NOW I PROMISE YOU THIS WILL -- IF WE HAVE ANOTHER FORM IN A COUPLE MONTHS AND IT IS STILL NOT THERE, I WILL BE IN TROUBLE. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, ON THE QUESTION THAT IS REALLY THE LYNCH PIN OF ALL THESE OTHER QUESTIONS, WHICH IS COVERAGE, THEIR ONLY IF YOU WAYS OF GETTING THERE. COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE YOU ARE THINKING IS ON THIS. HAVE YOU ACCEPTED OR REJECTED ANY OF THE CONCEPTS LIKE AN EMPLOYER MANDATE OR REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS PROVIDE COVERAGE. IN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE OR PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BUY INTO THE THAT THE SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THE AUTO INSURANCE. ARE YOU BUDDED TO THIS IDEA AS THE FIRST TO CANDIDATES WERE, THAT WE BASICALLY SHOULD STICK WITH THIS SYSTEM IN WHICH MOST PEOPLE GET THEIR COVERAGE FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS, OR HAVE YOU FOUND ANY POSITIVES TO THE IDEA THAT IS BEING OFFERED BY YOUR COLLEAGUE, RON WYDEN, TO ESSENTIALLY BREAK THE SYSTEM AND COME UP WITH ANYONE? COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHICH POSSIBILITY'S HERE INTREAT YOU AND WHICH ONES THAT MAYBE YOUR DISMISSING AT THIS POINT? >> WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UNVEILING. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SET UP A SERIES OF ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCE IT, NOT JUST WITH EXPERTS, WHICH WE PARTY THEN, RATHER WITH FRONT-LINE WORKERS, WITH NURSES COME WITH DOCTORS, WITH CONSUMERS, WHICH WERE GOING TO SCHEDULE THE NEXT COUPLE COUPLE OF MONTHS. LET ME ADDRESS A COUPLE OF POINTS. AS I INDICATED BEFORE, I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SOME SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN BUY INTO A LARGER POOL. RIGHT NOW THERE POOL TYPICALLY AS THEIR EMPLOYER, BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF DOING IT. I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD SET UP A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THOSE WHO CANNOT GO THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER TO ACCESS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM FOR A STATE POOL OF SOME SORT, BUT I DON'T THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE EMPLOYER COVERAGE IMMEDIATELY. THERE IS QUICK TO BE POTENTIALLY A TRANSITION PROCESS. I CAN ENVISION A DECADE OUT OR 15 OR 20 YEARS OUT WHERE WE'VE GOT A MUCH MORE PORTABLE SYSTEM. EMPLOYER STILL HAVE THE OPTION OF PROVIDING COVERAGE, BUT MANY PEOPLE MAY FIND THAT THEY GET BETTER COVERAGE FOR AT LEAST COVERAGE THAT GIVES THEM MORE FOR THE HEALTH CARE DOLLARS THEY SPEND OUTSIDE OF THEIR EMPLOYER. I THINK WE HAVE TO FACILITATE THAT AND LET INDIVIDUALS MAKE THAT CHOICE TO TRANSITION OUT OF EMPLOYER COVERAGE. I DO BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY OR PLAY. I THINK THAT EMPLOYERS EITHER HAVE TO PROVIDE HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES OR THEIR HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HELP PAY FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYER SYSTEM. AT THINK THAT IS ONE IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE. AS I SAID, THE SECOND IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO THAT PUT MORE MONEY INTO IN PREVENTION, CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT, MORE MONEY INTO MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCRUE THE SAVINGS THAT HELP US PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO THOSE WHO DO NOT ALREADY HAVE IT. >> THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> NOW I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO A QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR U.N.L.V. STUDENTS WHO IS HERE, AND I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ASSUMING THIS IS A MALE. MICHAEL BLYVILLE, A JOURNALISM STUDENT. I PROBABLY OUGHT TO TALK TO AFTERWARDS ABOUT THE WISDOM OF THAT. ARE YOU HERE MICHAEL? >> YES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MAJOR DISPARITIES -- WHERE YOU MIGHT? >> CURRENTLY THERE MAJOR DISPARITIES IN BOTH ACCESS TO INSURANCE AND RACIAL AND MINORITIES. HELLYER PLAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE? >> WELL, ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS THAT THERE ARE DISPARITIES IS THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS AMERICANS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY NOT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND SO, IF WE SET UP A SYSTEM WHICH EVERYBODY HAS HEALTH INSURANCE, SOME OF THOSE DISPARITIES ARE MEALY GOING TO BE REDUCED. I'M SURE WHEN OF THE STATISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IS THAT CLOSE TO 80% OF THOSE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE WORK. IN SOME CASES, FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BUT DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. [APPLAUSE] THEY'RE CLEANING BEDPANS AND CLEANING FLOORS AND HOSPITALS. THEY UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME SYSTEM FOR WHICH THERE CRITICAL PART OF. SO THOSE GROUPS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY MINORITY. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP. THERE SOME PARTICULAR ISSUES WITHIN IT THE MINORITY COMMUNITY I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS IN A TARGETED WAY. MORGAN EARLIER MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF LEAD PAINT. NOW THAT MAY SEEM LIKE AN ANCILLARY ISSUE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IN CITIES LIKE CHICAGO , THE INCIDENCE OF LEAD POISONING AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO YOUTH IS SKY-HIGH AND HIS USE RAMIFICATIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR LONG TERM HEALTH. OBESITY AND DIABETES IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES IS MORE SEVERE, AND SO I THINK TARGETED PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY TO CHILDREN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE GOT SOUND ATTRITION, THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND NOT JUST POTPIES -- THAT THEY HAVE THE SENSE SPACES TO PLAY AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES INSTEAD OF JUST BEING COOPED UP IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY. THOSE ARE SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE THINK WE CAN TARGET THE MINORITY COMMUNITY. WE ARE DIMENSION HIV AIDS, THE INCIDENCE IS GROWING MUCH HIGHER IN POOR POPULATIONS AND THOSE TEND TO BE MINORITY POPULATIONS. SO MAKING SURE WE'RE PUTTING MONEY INTO H.I.V. AND AIDS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES I THINK WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE. THERE WILL BE AREAS WHERE WE TARGET SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUED MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE COULD DO IS MAKE SURE EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS COVERAGE, EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS ACCESS TO BASIC PRIMARY-CARE, AND PREVENTATIVE CARE. WE'RE DOING THAT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE DISPARITIES CLOSE SIGNIFICANTLY. [APPLAUSE] >> NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION BY E-MAIL FROM WENDY AND OAK VIEW, CALIFORNIA. SHE WANTS TO KNOW, IS THE SINGLE MOTHER WHO MEETS THE BILLS BUT NOT MUCH MORE, I FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS, MAKING TOO MUCH FOR STATE ASSISTANCE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE. SO WHAT WE DO FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME? >> WELL, I THINK THAT IS THE GROUP I JUST REFERRED TO. WORKING PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING BENEFITS ON THE JOB, DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM A SUBSIDY SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS HEALTH INSURANCE. IT IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. IF YOU ARE WORKING FULL TIME IN THIS ECONOMY, THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE. ONE THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE A LOT OF SMALL EMPLOYERS, WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET HEALTH CARE TO THEIR WORKERS, BUT THEY THEMSELVES CANNOT AFFORD IT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO LARGE ENOUGH POOLS TO ALLOW THEM TO SAVE MONEY. THAT IS WHY I THINK IS MY TO BE IMPORTANT FOR US, IN WHATEVER SYSTEM WE SET UP, TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE EMPLOYER BASED SYSTEM, THAT WE HAVE GOT AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT GETTING IT THROUGH THE JOB CAN ACCESS. NOW, I JUST HAVE TO REPEAT SOMETHING I SAID EARLIER. I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF THIS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGE FOR US IS TO BUILD A POLITICAL CONSENSUS AROUND THE NEED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THEY'RE ONLY A HANDFUL OF OPTIONS. YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THEM THAT ARE OUT THERE. JOHN EDWARDS HAS PUT OUT A PLAN, WHICH I THINK IS VERY CREDIBLE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. I WAS LISTENING TO GOV. RICHARDS AND AND HE IS THAT SOME GOOD IDEAS. EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE GOOD IDEAS. THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE ABLE TO BRING A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE RUN THE NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM NOW? ONE THING THAT MAKES ME FEEL MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS THAN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TENDERED 12 YEARS AGO IS THE FACT THAT BUSINESS IS FEELING THE PINCH. LARGE CORPORATIONS RECOGNIZE THAT THEY CANNOT BE COMPETITIVE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE IF THEIR HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE RISING AT A CONSTANT CLIP AND THAT COMPETITORS DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE IT IS ALL COVERED THROUGH A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. SMALL BUSINESSES KNOW THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT GOING TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE IF THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. SO, WHAT I THINK IS AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS TO BRING BUSINESS, LABOUR, CONSUMERS, PROVIDERS TOGETHER AND STAY FOCUSED ON IT FOR A YEAR, TWO YEARS, HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS. [APPLAUSE] SPEAK ONE MORE QUESTION. WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION. I REALIZING YOUR PLAN IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, WE'VE HEARD SOME DISAGREEMENT ON THE STATE ALREADY TODAY ABOUT WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT RAISING CORTEXES. HAVE YOU COME INTO THIS WITH A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS OR ARE YOU GOING TO PUT TAXES ON THE TABLE OR TAKEN OFF NOW? >> IT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY ON THE FRONT END INTO CREATING A NEW SYSTEM. LET ME TAKE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT USING MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY TO CUT DOWN ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, BUREACRACY, MAKE SURE WE DO NOT HAVE EVERYTHING SIGNED IN TRIPLICATE EVERY TIME YOU GO INTO A HOSPITAL. DOCTORS AND NURSES AND PHARMACISTS ARE COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY THROUGH PA INSTEAD OF WRITING, SCRIBBLING NOTES NOBODY CAN READ, IF WE DO ALL THOSE THINGS THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITY HOSPITALS OUT THERE THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE COMPUTERIZATION AND THE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS TO SET THAT UP. WE MAY NEED TO SUBSIDIZE THEM. WHY DO HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY IN ON THE FRONT END. I THINK THAT WE CAN, BY MAKING THE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT, GET A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND USE THAT TO HELP SUBSIDIZE WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE IT AND TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM. I HAVE NOT YET MADE THE DECISION IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MONEY IS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MEET MICHAEL OF INSURING THAT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE EXISTS IN THIS COUNTRY WITHIN SIX YEARS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES BECAUSE I THINK, OVER THE LONG TERM, IT IS GOOD FOR FAMILIES, IT IS GOOD FOR BUSINESSES, IT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. I HAVE NOT FORECLOSED THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MY GOAL, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE SAVED IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND I ALSO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THAT WE MAY BE PUTTING IN SOME FRONT IN INVESTMENTS, WE MAY HAVE TO SPEND SEVERAL EXTRA BILLION DOLLARS ON THE FRONT AND AS WE TRANSITION TO A MORE INTELLIGENT SYSTEM. WE WILL GET THOSE SAVINGS ON THE BACK END. ONE PLUS POINT I WOULD MAKE IT A WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SAVINGS GOING TO THE POCKETS OF FAMILIES AND NOT INSURANCE COMPANIES OR DRUG COMPANIES. THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. [APPLAUSE] SO ONE OF MY PRIORITIES IS, IF WE CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM, WHATEVER THE MECHANISM IS, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES ARE SEEING LOWER PREMIUMS, LOWER COPAYMENTS, AND ALSO THAT HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS ARE NOT GETTING SQUEEZED IN THIS PROCESS OF MAKING A MORE EFFICIENT. I GET MOST OF SKERRITT WHEN I START HEARING THE BEST WE TO SAVE THE SYSTEM IS TO CUT REIMBURSEMENTS, TO HOSPITALS OR TO CUT REIMBURSEMENTS TO DOCTORS , OR STOP GIVING RAISES TO NURSES, OR HAVE NURSES WORK TEN, 12, 15 PATIENTS OR 20 PATIENTS. THAT IS NOT REALLY SAVING THE SYSTEM. ALL THAT IS DOING IS IS COMPOUNDING SOME OF THE ERRORS WERE MADE IN THE SYSTEM. OKAY? >> THANK YOU GUYS. THANK YOU. >> YOU ARE WATCHING ILLINOIS SENATOR BARACK OBAMA LEAVE THE STAGE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE WAITING NOW FOR FORMER FIRST LADY, HILLARY CLINTON. >> THE NEXT CANDIDATES WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM THIS MORNING IS SENATOR KELLY BROUGHT HIM CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> IT IS NICE TO SEE YOU. >> WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO STAND OR SIT? >> WELL, HELLO EVERYONE. I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE AND TO BE PART OF THIS DEBATE. FIRST, I THINK WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SEND OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO ELIZABETH AND JOHN EDWARDS, AND I AM VERY -- [APPLAUSE] I AM VERY IMPRESSED BY ELIZABETH STRENGTH AND OPTIMISM AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING BOTH ELIZABETH AND JOHN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL GOING FORWARD. AND THEY WANT TO THANK YOU AND L.B. FOR HOSTING THIS. IS GREAT TO BE HERE AND TO BE IN ONE OF THE EARLY CAUCUS STATES. I WANT TO THANK CAP, THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, FOR ALL THAT CAP IS DOING TO PUT HEALTH CARE ON THE AGENDA FOR AMERICA. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK SEIU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR -- ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE BUT ACTUALLY REPRESENTING PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND TAKE CARE OF ALL OF US ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK AND THE STERN FOR BEING A LEADER, A VISIONARY LEADER ON THIS. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY NEW YORK STATE 1199 SEIU MEMBERS, WHO I AM PROUD TO WORK WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY. NOW DO YOU KNOW, I FEEL LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS IS DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN. I WORKED WITH SOME OF THE WHO ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN WE TRY TO CONVINCE THE COUNTRY AND THE CONGRESS-BUT WE CONVINCED THE COUNTRY BUT WE DID NOT CONVINCE THE CONGRESS THAT WE NEEDED, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY TO MOVE TOWARD AND ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. NOW, I AM PROUD WE TRIED. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED, BUT WE SET THE GROUNDWORK IN PLACE SO THAT NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING, BOY, WE WISH WE HAD DONE THAT BACK THEN. BECAUSE COSTS HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PRESSURES ON THE SYSTEM, ON OUR DOCTORS, OUR NURSES, OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE JUST BEEN SO STRESSFUL. I MEAT COURSES EVERY DAY, WHO TELL ME THEY'RE THINKING OF QUITTING THE PROFESSION THEY LOVE BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING TO WORK OVERTIME, THEY NOW HAVE TO NURSES COVERING WHERE 45 USE TO COVER, THERE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED IT, AND EACH ONE OF YOU COULD TELL ME A STORY LIKE THAT. SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE A COMMITMENT, AND I AM PROUD THAT EVERYONE RUNNING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS COMMITTED TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. [APPLAUSE] NOW WE WERE ONLY GIVEN THREE MINUTES AND AS SOME OF DO YOU KNOW I COULD TALK THREE HOURS OR THREE DAYS ABOUT HEALTH CARE. LET ME BRIEFLY SAY, NUMBER ONE, I AM IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THAT BRINGS IN THE 47 MILLION WHO ARE UNINSURED, WHICH IS A DISGRACE IN OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THAT BEGINS TO GUARANTEE COVERAGE TO PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE INSURANCE, BECAUSE LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE INSURANCE EXCEPT WHEN NEEDED. I MET A WOMAN IN AUSTIN TX LESLI CASSETTE I'M A TEACHER, SENATOR, I MAKE $38,000 I HAVE INSURANCE THROUGH MY EMPLOYER, THE LAST YEAR SPENT $19,000 OUT OF MY POCKET, HALF OF INCOME, BECAUSE SHE HAD A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. SO WE CANNOT GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE UNLESS WE AND INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] NOW I DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL I PRESIDENT TO DO THAT. AND GOING TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION WHILE I'M IN THE SENATE TO END INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION, GUARANTEED COVERAGE, NO MORE CHERRY PICKING , YOU CANNOT ELIMINATE PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE NEED INSURANCE FOR. WE HAVE NOW MET THE HUMAN GENO. WERE QUICK TO FIND OUT WHERE ALL SUSCEPTIBLE TO SOMETHING. NONE OF THIS IS LIKE TO BE INSURABLE OF WE DON'T CHANGE THE SYSTEM, AND I THINK WE NEED TO START NOW IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME SENSE OUT OF IT AND GET PEOPLE THE COVERAGE THEY DESERVE TO HAVE. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THE MONEY WE HAVE GOT IN THE SYSTEM. WE ALREADY SPEND MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AND WE DON'T GET THE BEST RESULTS. BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THESE UNINSURED PEOPLE AND ALL THESE UNDER INSURED PEOPLE, AND MANY OF YOU AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY, WHO CANNOT AFFORD YOUR DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS, YOU GO WITHOUT CARE AND THE PROBLEM GETS WORSE. WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE QUALITY, CONTROL COSTS, AND WE'RE GOING TO ONCE AND FOR ALL HAVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IS WORTHY OF OUR COUNTRY. ALBINO PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYBODY HOW HARD THIS WILL BE. I KNOW, I'VE GOT THE SCARS TO SHOW FOR IT. I HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT, BUT THAT MAKES ME MORE DETERMINED. IT ALSO MAKES METRES AND WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. WE GOT TO MODERNIZE AND REFORM THE WAY WE DELIVER HEALTH CARE, BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE FINANCE HEALTH CARE. AND THAT IS GOING TO MEAN TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO MAKE OUT REALLY WELL RIGHT NOW. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG POLITICAL BATTLE. WHAT I AM DOING IN MY CAMPAIGN IS TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE EVERY CHANCE I GET, ASKING PEOPLE FOR YOUR IDEAS, YOUR SUGGESTIONS. I WAS LISTENING TO QUESTIONS ASKED, THE GREAT QUESTIONS, THEY DESERVE ANSWERS. WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. BUT, IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT TO GET HAVE A BILL FOR THE CONGRESS, WE COULD KEEP TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED WILL KEEP GOING UP. WE'LL KEEP SPENDING MORE MONEY AND WE WON'T HAVE MUCH TO SHOW FOR IT. SO WE DON'T ONLY BE CANDIDATES TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WE DON'T JUST BE CANDIDATES TO HAVE A PLAN. WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE PLANS, THAT IS NOT IN DOUBT. WE NEED A MOVEMENT. WE NEED PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS THE NUMBER ONE VOTING ISSUE IN THE 08 ELECTION TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS AND THE SPECIAL INTEREST, WE'RE SERIOUS AND WERE QUICK TO GET IT DONE THIS TIME. [APPLAUSE] SO, AS I SAID KAREN I COULD KEEP TALKING BUT I AM SURE MY TIME FOR THE THREE MINUTES IS UP. LET ME TURN NOW TO QUESTIONS. >> THANKS A LOT. WELL, I WAS INTRIGUED BY, EACH IS MADE. YOU SAID WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE FINANCE THE SYSTEM BY TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DOING WELL NOW. SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? >> WELL, LET'S START WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES. [APPLAUSE] THE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAKE MONEY BY SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY AND EMPLOYING A LOT OF PEOPLE TO TRY TO AVOID INSURING YOU COME AND THEN IF YOU ARE INSURED, TO TRY TO AVOID PAYING FOR THE HEALTH CARE YOU RECEIVED. AND I SEE THIS ALL THE TIME. MY OFFICE SPENDS A LOT OF EFFORT HELPING PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE GET HEALTH CARE CARED TOO QUICK EXAMPLES. A FATHER CALLED ME FROM NORTHERN NEW YORK. YET THE SUN WITH A VERY SERIOUS AILMENT. HE WAS WELL INSURED, HE WORKED, HAD WORKED FOR A LONG TIME FOR THE SAME EMPLOYER WHO GAVE HIM A GOOD POLICY. HIS SON NEEDED A SPECIAL OPERATION AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THAT. IT WAS ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY THAT REALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID, I AM SORRY THAT IS OUT OF NETWORK, YOU HAVE HEARD THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEND YOU TO HAVE IT THEN. MY OFFICE INTERVENED. WE GET A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION WHEN I CALL. WE SAID, WE'LL THINK THIS IS RIGHT. THIS MAN HAS PAID HIS SHARE OF HIS PREMIUMS, HIS EMPLOYER HAS BARGAINED FOR THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE. SO, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, WE GOT THE OPERATION BUT I JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO THEIR U.S. SENATOR DEGETTE THERE INSURANCE COMPANY TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE. [APPLAUSE] SECOND FESTS STORY. WE'RE HAVING AN EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES, YOU WILL KNOW THAT. WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH ADULT ONSET DIABETES CARE THE I'M TALKING 12, 13, 15, 16 YEAR OLDS. WE'RE SEEING THE COST OF TIDIEST GO UP EXPEDITIOUSLY. WELL, A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NOT PAY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS PREDIABETIC OR BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES, TO GO TO NUTRITIONISTS TO FIND OUT HOW BETTER TO FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES, TO GO TO THE PODIATRIST TO HAVE THEIR FEET TRACT. BUT THEY WILL PAY IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR FOOT AMPUTATED. BECAUSE THE REASONING IS, AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL TELL YOU THIS, THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THAT IS LIKE A LOST AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SURE THAT THE PATIENT OR THE INSURED PERSON WILL STILL BE WITH THEM. BUT THEY'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE DOCTORS AND WE'RE GONNA DO HAVE TO AMPUTATE THE FOOT, THEY'RE KIND OF STUCK WITH IT. THAT IS UPSIDE DOWN AND BACKWARDS. SO WE COULD SAVE MONEY IF WE CHANGED THE INCENTIVES TO REQUIRE THAT PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AND WE'LL THIS BE COVERED AND INCENTIVIZED AND WE COULD REQUIRE THAT EVERY INSURANCE COMPANY HAD TO ENSURE EVERYBODY AND NO EXCLUSIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND THAT WOULD BE ONE THING WE COULD DO. [APPLAUSE] >> SPEAKING OF THE LATEST FINANCE, WHEN YOU DO COME UP WITH THEIR PLAN THIS TIME, IS IT GOING TO ONCE AGAIN INCLUDE WHAT WAS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECT OF YOUR PLAN LAST TIME, WHICH WAS THIS EMPLOYER MANDATE, THE REQUIREMENT THAT COMPANIES COVER THEIR WORKERS? WHAT ALSO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY AUTO INSURANCE AND THE MODEL WE HAVE SEEN PUT FORWARD IN MASSACHUSETTS AND CALIFORNIA? >> WELD THEIR ONLY COUPLE OF WAYS TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND I AM PLEASED THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, BOTH RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND IN THE CONGRESS, ARE SAYING LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO ONE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT'S CLEAR CLEAR TO BUILD ON EMPLOYER BASED SYSTEM, NO MORE FREE WRITERS, NO MORE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT INSURE EVERYBODY AND SHIFT THEIR COSTS ON TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT DO AND ON TO THE TAXPAYER. SO EVERY EMPLOYER IS GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE OR PAY INTO A POOL, WHERE THAT MONEY CAN BE USED TO HELP PEOPLE. AND WE MAY HAVE TO SAY LOOK, IT IS EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO BE INJURED. SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE COME UP TO ME -- AND I UNDERSTAND THIS. AND THEY SAY THINGS LIKE, DO YOU KNOW, I AM HEALTHY. I DON'T NEED INSURANCE. I WILL SAY WELL, DO YOU DRIVE CARS? HAVE YOU EVER DRIVEN A MOTORCYCLE? DO YOU WALK ACROSS THE STREET AND SOMETIMES NOT LOOK ALIKE? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENS YOU. INSURANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU, YOU'LL BE TAKEN CARE AND FRANKLY IT IS TO PROTECT REST OF US WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES. WE'RE BEING RESPONSIBLE. I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED THAT ON BOTH ENDS OF OUR COUNTRY, IN MASSACHUSETTS AND CALIFORNIA, AN IDEA WE FIRST FLOATED IN 1984. INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE SO IF YOUR EMPLOYER DOES NOT PROVIDE IT AND YOU ARE NOT COVERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT-FUNDED PROGRAMS, THEN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE IN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN TO YOU, YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYBODY ELSE. SO THE SO-CALLED INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY. I THINK THAT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE, AND THEIR PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT CUED WHERE CAN THEY GO TO GET A GOOD POLICY? WE HAVE TO REALLY GOOD PROGRAMS OPERATING RIGHT NOW, MEDICARE WHICH TAKES CARE PEOPLE OVER 65 HAS THE LOWEST ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF ANY INSURANCE PROGRAM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH PRIVATE INSURANCE CHARGES FOR ADMINSTRATION AND OVERHEAD AND PROFIT OF COURSE, YOU COMPARE WITH MEDICARE. THERE'S NO COMPARISON. MEDICARE IS LIKE 3% COMPARED TO ANYTHING FROM TEN TO 35 WERE UP. WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN. PEOPLE LIKE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEY CAN GO TO THIS POOL -- IT'S A BIG SHARING ARRANGEMENT, AND THEY CAN HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHOICES. FINNEGAN PICKLE EXCITIVE INSURANCE POLICY. THEY'RE YOUNG AND THINK THE ONLY NEED CATASTROPHIC CARE, THEY CAN GET THAT. IF THEY HAVE KIDS WITH SOME KIND OF PROBLEM, THEY CAN GET COVERAGE FOR THAT. SO WE CAN LOOK AT HOW WE PROVIDE A BACKUP GOVERNMENT SPONSORED APPROACH TO COMPLEMENT THE EMPLOYER SYSTEM IF WE STAY WITH THE EMPLOYER SYSTEM. THE FINAL THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT IS, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN '93 AND '94 IS THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT, EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE, BUT WE DIDN'T DO GOOD ENOUGH JOB EXPLAINING IT AND WE'LL DO A BETTER JOB THIS TIME, PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CHANGE WHAT THEY HAD CARRIED A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE, SO WE WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE FEELING LIKE, OH MY GOODNESS THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO COME IN AND TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND WHAT DR. I HAVE TO GO TO. THAT WAS NEVER PART OF THE PLAN, BUT SOME PEOPLE GOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT. BUILDING ON WHAT WE HAVE AND HAVING A BRIDGE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS INCLUDED AND AT THE END OF THAT BRIDGE HAVING AN ALTERNATIVE THAT IS A GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ALTERNATIVE, GIVES PEOPLE A CHOICE. SO THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AS A FRAMEWORK, BECAUSE REALLY EVERY PLAN YOUR RIGHT TO HEAR THAT HAS SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE ELEMENTS. [APPLAUSE] >> CENTER, RIGHT NOW WOULD LIKE TO TURN THINGS OVER TO COURTNEY, IN HER JOB WITH THE CLARKE COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY SEES EVERY DAY A LOT OF THE KINDS OF PEOPLE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, PEOPLE HAVE COVERAGE BUT CANNOT AFFORD THE HEALTH CARE CARED COURTNEY ARE YOU HERE? >> HI COURTNEY. >> HELLO. I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF SEIU AND WORK FOR THE CLARKE COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY. MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT I SERVE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS ARE LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, SENIORS, AND DISABLED PEOPLE LIVING ON FIXED INCOME. MANY OF THEM HAVE HEALTH CARE BUT STILL SPENT A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF POCKET, WHICH HONESTLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO. SO, HOW AND WHAT TIME LINE ARE YOU GOING TO REIN IN HEALTH-CARE COSTS? >> THAT IS A REAL GOOD QUESTION COURTNEY BECAUSE, IF WE DON'T GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL, YOU CONNECT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN AND IT WILL STILL KEEP COSTING MORE AND MORE MONEY FOR EVERYBODY IN IT. AND EMIL LOOP WILL BE BACK TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. I WANT TO DO SEVERAL THINGS. NUMBER ONE, AS I SAID I WANT TO END INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE UNDER SOME RESTRICTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN CHARGE PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO TO THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR INSURANCE. NUMBER TWO, I HAD A BILL THAT I WORKED ON FOR FOUR YEARS IN THE SENATE TO MOVE US TO AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. WE PASSED THE SENATE, WE DID NOT PASS THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE. WERE COMING BACK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THOSE OF YOU AND HELP CARE KNOW THE ANSWER. USE BENTZEL MUCH OF YOUR TIME DOING RECORD KEEPING, TRYING TO READ RECORDS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE, TRY TO FAX RECORDS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT RIGHT HERE IN YOUR HOME AND NEED THEIR RECORDS. YOU GO TO ALL OF THIS MISPLACING RECORDS. WE ARE DROWNING, AND FRANKLY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE WE HAVE A PAPER SYSTEM IN THE HEALTH-CARE FIELD. WE DON'T RELY ON PAPER AND ANY OTHER BIG PART OF OUR ECONOMY ANYMORE. BECAUSE WE RELY ON PAPER, WE ARE WASTING MONEY. WE CAN SAVE BY AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT $100 BILLION A YEAR IF WE MOVE TOWARD ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, AND I WANT TO START REQUIRING THAT PEOPLE WHO DO BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, NAMELY MEDICARE, MEDICAID, THE A, A FEDERAL BENEFIT PLAN, THEY WILL HAVE TO MOVE TOWARD ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. I AM WILLING TO PUT SOME UP-FRONT MONEY INTO THAT TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE ALL THESE DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE IT SYSTEMS CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER. YOU ARE TAKING CARE SOMEBODY HERE IN LAS VEGAS, THEY HAVE FAMILY IN ARIZONA OR L.A., THEY GO THERE, SLIP AND FALL. THEY GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, HE START WITH THE HISTORY. HE START WITH TESTS THAT MAYBE THEY TOOK TWO WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS AGO. AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, I WENT DOWN TO HOUSTON TO SEE THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN EVACUATED, MOST OF THEM FROM THE CONVENTION CENTER, THE ELDERLY, THE FREE, PEOPLE MORE DEPENDENT ON HEALTH CARE. THEIR RECORDS ARE GONE. THOSE PIECES OF PAPER OR DESTROYED. A LOT OF THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PRESCRIPTIONS TO GET TO PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU HAD ELDERLY FOLKS WHO KNEW THEY WERE TAKING PILLS BUT DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE. I TAKE A PINK PILL IN THE MORNING IN A BLUE PILL IN THE AFTERNOON. THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS. THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY COULD HELP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAD SHOPPED AT CHAIN DRUG STORES BECAUSE THEY HAVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. IF WE HAD THAT FOR ALL OF OUR HEALTH CARE RECORDS, WE WOULD GET COSTS DOWN AND HAVE HIGHER QUALITY HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE TO DO ALL THIS AT THE SAME TIME TO HELP GET THOSE COSTS DOWN AND TO HELP PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, YOU SAID YOU CAN DO THIS WITH NO BIG NEW TAXES. SO WHERE THIS IS UP FRONT MONEY COME FROM? >> I'M TALKING FOR EXAMPLE ON THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, MAYBE $200 MILLION TO GET THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SYSTEM PUT INTO PLACE, GIVE OR TAKE MONEY. THAT IS WHAT WE ESTIMATED WHEN WE DID IT ORIGINALLY. THERE WILL BE SOME INVESTMENTS, BUT WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED TO SPEND, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE SPEND NATIONALLY. IT IS NOT JUST WITH THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS, IT IS WHAT ALL OF THIS BAND. WE ALREADY SPEND MORE MONEY THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. I CANNOT SEE US PUTTING MORE MONEY AS A NATIONAL EXPENDITURE AND TO HEALTH CARE WITHOUT MODERNIZING THE SYSTEM, WITHOUT ENDING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION, WITHOUT BEGINNING TO EMPHASIZE WELLNESS AND PREVENTION. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START TAKING BETTER CARE OF THEMSELVES. WE CANNOT AFFORD ALL THE LESS THAT FOLKS ARE BURNING ON THEMSELVES. THERE THINGS WE HAVE NO CONTROL, THERE THINGS WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER AND WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT. BUT WHAT WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IS, HOW CAN WE SAVE MONEY OVER THE LONG RUN? I AM WILLING TO PUT IN SOME UP FRONT INVESTMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS, AND I THINK WE CAN THEN SAVE MONEY IS TO GO FORWARD. BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD START FROM THE POSITION WHERE WE SIT WERE CUT TO INCREASE ALL OF THESE COSTS BY PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO A SYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN. WE HAVE TO FIX THIS SYSTEM SO IT SERVES PEOPLE BETTER. IT TAKES BETTER CARE OF THOSE WHO TAKE CARE OF US AND WE TAKE BETTER CARE OF OURSELVES, AND THAT IS THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH THIS. >> SENATOR, WE ARE HACKETTSTOWN BUT I DID WANT TO ASK YOU ONE LAST QUICK QUESTION. SEVERAL CANDIDATES WE HAVE HEARD FROM TODAY HAVE SAID THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN THEIR FIRST TERM. U.S. SUGGESTED THAT IT COULD TAKE TO TERMS, IT COULD TAKE EIGHT YEARS. ARE THEY BEING REALISTIC? >> I THINK WE ALL ARE GOING TO TRY TO START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE MEDICARE SUBSCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT. I DID NOT VOTE FOR, AND ITS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT EXACTLY HAVE THE GREATEST TRACK RECORD ON CONFIDENCE. IT TOOK A WHILE. I THINK WE CAN MOVE MORE QUICKLY BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THIS WE'LL BE A SERIES OF STEPS. BUT LET ME END WERE STARTED. WE'RE ALL FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WE HAD A BIG DEBATE ABOUT IT, '93 AND '94. THAT DEBATE IS OVER. THE DEMOCRATS STAND UNITED. WE'RE ALL FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE TO DO IS PERSUADE THE COUNTRY, NOT ONLY TO VOTE FOR A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO HELP ELECT A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS OF THIS, AND I KNOW PEOPLE WOULD RATHER NOT THINK ABOUT POLITICS BECAUSE THAT IS THAT A DOWNER, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS, WE GOT STOPPED IN THE SENATE IN 1994 BY A FILIBUSTER. DO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, UNLESS YOU GET 60 VOTES, UNLESS YOU HAVE MORE THAN 60 DEMOCRATS YET TO GET SOME REPUBLICANS. WE GOT STOPPED BECAUSE THEY SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. AND WE COULD NOT BREAK IT, AND THAT WAS THE END. WE CANNOT GET ENOUGH REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW TO VOTE WITH US TO TRY TO BEGIN TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ. WE CAN'T, WE'RE TRYING. EVERY SINGLE WEEK, WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE TO TRY TO GET THEM TO VOTE WITH US. THE WAY THE SENATE OR, YOU HAVE TO GET TO 60 VOTES. THAT IS WHY I SAID, I SURE HOPE YOU'LL LET ME PRESENT BUT I WANT FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AND I WANT A MOVEMENT TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE REFORM AND WE'RE GOING TO NEEDED, SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT IS WHAT WE DO IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT THIS SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON WALKING OFF THE STAGE. SHE SAYS SHE'S PROUD OF THE HEALTH-CARE BATTLE TO FOUGHT IN '93 AND '94 AND SAYS SHE'S LOOKING TO FIGHT THEM AGAIN. WAITING NOW FOR NEXT SPEAKER, SENATOR CHRIS DODD. >> OUR NEXT CANADA WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM IS SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD OF CONNECTICUT. >> GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ALL OF US TO COME BY HERE THIS MORNING TO BE A PART OF THIS PROGRAM. I THANK YOU KIRAN FOR ACTING AS THE HOST. THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, WHAT TO THANK THEM AS WELL. SEIU FOR YOUR WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP. IN THE STERN AS WELL. FOR GIVING US A CHANCE TO BE HERE. LET ME ALSO MENTION I DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM BUT I THINK ALL THIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE INCREDIBLE RESPECT FOR ELIZABETH EDWARDS AND FOR JOHN EDWARDS AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH HERE TODAY. I DID NOT WANT TO BEGIN THESE REMARKS ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND NOT BUILT TO --VILLE TO MENTION THEM AS WELL. AND DEEPLY PROUD OF THE INVITATION TO BE WITH YOU. BRAD OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SEIU AND ITS WORK OVER THE EIGHT DECADES OF SERVING IN THE INTEREST OF NOT ONLY ITS BUT PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WERE NOT MEMBERS OF SEIU WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE. I'VE BEEN THROUGH EIGHT ELECTIONS IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT AND I PRACTICE SAY THE STATE ELECTIONS I'VE HAD THE SUPPORT OF SE I U AND I THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] AND FOR THOSE 32 YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, I AM PROUD TO SAY I HAVE A 95% VOTING RECORD WITH ORGANIZED LABOR THIS COUNTRY. I STAND WITH UNIONS, I STAND WITH LABOR AND I THINK YOU AS WELL. I AM PROUD OF THAT RELATIONSHIP. I MENTIONED THAT TO THIS MORNING BECAUSE I MET THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT WHERE WE WANT TO GO FROM HERE, HOW WE WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, THE WHEELS OF A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE YOU BEEN. AND AS 32 YEARS THE WORK I'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN AT IS SOMETHING I'M PROUD OF BUT IT IS AN INDICATION OF WHAT KIND OF I WILL OFFER AS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE NINE STATES AND HOW WOULD SERVE THE COUNTRY. I AM PREACHING TO A CHOIR HERE AND TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE. WE ALL KNOW IT IS IN A SERIOUS CRISIS. THE NUMBERS ARE STARTLING. HE SAID WE HAVE RANKED 26 IN THE WORLD AND LIFE EXPECTANCY, SOMETHING LIKE 28 IN THE WORLD AND IN THE MORTALITY RATES. WE RANK SOMETHING LIKE 37TH IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF OVERALL FAIRNESS OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE COUNT FOR MORE THAN 50% OF ALL THE MONEY SPENT WORLDWIDE ON HEALTH CARE IN THE AD STATES. ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU THIS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS WORKING, THOSE FACTS ALONE OUGHT TO BE A SOURCE OF COLLECTIVE SHAME IN THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT WE RANK AS POORLY AS WE DO. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE MOST AFFLUENT COUNTRY IN HISTORY OF MANKIND. WE NEED TO BE DOING A FAR BETTER JOB IS SERVING AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE. I STAND FIRMLY IN EFFORTS TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] LET ME STATE TO YOU HERE AS WELL WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. FIRST OF ALL IT IS IMPORTED WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WE DON'T LIMIT THE CONVERSATION TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITHIN THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM ITSELF. IN THE 20TH-CENTURY WE EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCY BY 30 YEARS. ONLY FIVE OF THIS 30 YEARS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE OF IMPROVED HEALTH CARE. ABOUT 25 OF THOSE YEARS ACTUALLY COME FROM BETTER NUTRITION, BETTER HOUSING, BETTER JOBS, BETTER INCOMES FOR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT HAD MORE TO DO WITH INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ITSELF. THE REASON I MENTION THAT TO YOU IS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE EXAMINE THIS ISSUE, WE ALSO LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE INCOME INEQUALITY, THE ABILITY TO HAVE RETIREMENT, WHICH IS A WAGES, A DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS. THOSE ELEMENTS IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PEOPLE'S HEALTH. IF YOU ARE BETTER OFF FINANCIALLY, BETTER EDUCATED THAN A LIKELIHOOD IS YOU'LL BE IN BETTER HEALTH. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS , WITH A RETIREMENT IN GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS IF YOU ARE TRULY INTERESTED IN MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS IMPORTANT AS CONCEPTS AND IDEAS INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION. AS FOR THE HEALTH-CARE PROPOSALS THEMSELVES, LET ME QUICKLY MENTION THE FOUR PRINCIPLES, WHICH I THINK ARE ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ONE IS WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY FROM THE OTHERS, AND THAT IS UNIVERSALITY. THAT EVERYONE PARTICIPATES, EVERYONE BENEFITS. ALL STAKEHOLDERS, INDIVIDUALS, EMPLOYERS THE GOVERNMENT ARE INVOLVED IN COMING UP BOTH THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REDUCE NUMBERS OF 47 MILLION OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS WHO HAVE NO HEALTH CARE AND MAKE SURE THERE WILL BE INCLUDED. SECOND IS PREVENTION ALONE. WHAT WE TRIED TO DO TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE THE COST OF STOPPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING ILL IN FIRST PLACE. RENT 70% OF HEALTH-CARE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES IN AMERICA. WE NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SEE TO IT THAT PEOPLE GET SCREENING, PROPER MANAGED CARE, TO REDUCE KINDS OF PROBLEMS BEFORE THE MERGER. THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM TODAY DEALS WITH WHEN YOU GET SICK. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION WHAT ALL THE PROBLEMS AT THE SPACE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS BY 60% IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE WORK THEY'VE DONE ON PRESCREENING AND DEALING WITH PEOPLE BEFORE THEY BECOME ILL. PREVENTION HAS TO BE A MAJOR PART OF THIS. BUILD UPON THE GOOD THINGS WERE DONE ALREADY, 40 YEARS OF MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. I WOULD EXTEND MEDICAID, TO POOR FAMILIES, 100% POVERTY. THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE WORKED VERY VERY WELL FOR PEOPLE, EXPANDING THEM, EXTENDING MIMICS A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. LESLIES' THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE, DEALING WITH TECHNOLOGY. I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF THIS AS WELL. 80 OR $90 BILLION COULD BE SAVED LET ME TELL YOU WHAT ALSO IS IMPORTANT IN ALL THIS. WHEN LOOKING AT THOSE OF US WHO SEEK YOUR SUPPORT FROM THE NOMINATION. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DO DURING THE 26 YEARS IN THE SENATE I'VE TAKEN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND MADE THE NATIONAL POLICIES. SPENCE SEVEN YEARS TO PASS FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. IT WAS MY PIECE OF LEGISLATION. 50 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF THAT LEGISLATION. I STARTED THE CHILDRENS CAUCUS IN THE SENATE. I OFFERED THE LEGISLATION TO DO HEADSTART AND PROGRAMS DEALING WITH AND THEN SCREENINGS, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR CHILDREN. IN EVERY INSTANCE I'VE DONE IT BY REACHING BACK TO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY NEEDS TO BE PLAN AND A PROGRAM THAT CAN BUILD US LIMBERNESS TOGETHER. WILL NOT SURVIVE MUCH LONGER IN THIS COUNTRY DIVIDED 51, 49 CAPABILITY TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN REACH OUT TO OTHERS AND BRING THEM TO THE TABLE AND WORK OUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER. WE CANNOT WAIT MUCH LONGER. THAT IS WHAT I DO AS A LEGISLATOR. THAT IS WHAT I'LL DO AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO BRING THE STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THERE, WORK TOGETHER FOR THE COMMON GOALS WILL HAVE IN MIND AND THAT IS TO SEE THIS COUNTRY HAVE APPROVED HEALTH CARE, IMPROVED ECONOMICS FOR THE PEOPLE OF VERNATION. MAJESKI TODAY, TO LOOK NOT ONLY AT WHAT WE OFFER YOU HEAR BUT THE PROVEN ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WHERE WE STOOD OVER THE YEARS AND WE'RE REALLY IN THE FUTURE. I AM THE FATHER OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. I HOUSE RIGHT NOW IS LIKE A PETRIE DISH. I'VE GOT A FIVE-YEAR OLD AND ITS-YEAR-OLD AND ONE HAS STRUCK ROAD AND THE OTHER HAS AN INFECTION OF SOME KIND OR OTHER KIDS DEALING WITH CHILDREN AND THEIR PROBLEMS, GOING TO SCHOOL AND COMING BACK. AND THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT GETS MAIL FROM AARP AND DIAPER SERVICES. I HAVE A RATHER BROAD REACH HERE IS A CANDIDATE IN TALKING ABOUT THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT FAMILIES GO THROUGH. I AM A U.S. SENATOR. I VIEW WONDERFUL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. I WANT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE AS GOOD HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AS IT REMEMBER OF THE U.S. CONGRESS THAT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL STAND AND FIGHT FOR. I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I ASK FOR SUPPORT IN THE UPCOMING NOMINATION PROCESS AND I PROMISE AS YOUR PRESIDENT WE WILL DEAL WITH THIS HEALTH CARE ISSUE. WE WILL PULL PEOPLE TOGETHER, HAVE A GOOD SOUND HEALTH CARE PROGRAM FOR ALL AMERICANS. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU KAREN. >> SENATOR, PLEASE ONE POLITICAL COMMENTARY OUT HERE SUGGESTED YOU SHOULD WIN THE CAUCUS IF ONLY BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO BE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE FIELD AND KNOWS IT IS PRONOUNCED NEVADA. >> THAT IS CORRECT. NEVADA. YOU HAVE TO PASS AT LEAST THAT'S TEST IT SEEMS TO ME. >> YOU WERE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL COSPONSORS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH CARE BILL IN 1993. AND IT NEVER GOT SO FAR AS A VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF EITHER HOUSE. HE SUGGESTS THERE'S BEEN A FAILURE OF ON THIS ISSUE. BUT, IN FACT, ALL OF THE OLD OPPONENTS ARE STILL OUT THERE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT IS CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE, IN THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THINGS COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED ON HEALTH CARE THAT SIMPLY WERE NOT POSSIBLE IN 1994? >> I SEE A NUMBER OF THINGS. FIRST OF ALL THE COSTS ALONE, 12 OR 14 YEARS AGO THE OVERALL COSTS WHERE SOME MORELLA LESS THAN $1 TRILLION A THING. TODAY WE'RE LOOKING AT A COST FIGURE SOMEWHAT IN EXCESS OF $2.3 TRILLION. YOU ARE WATCHING INDUSTRY BEGINNING TO REDUCE THOSE HEALTH CARE PLANS. THEY'RE NOT DOING IT BECAUSE THEY'RE EVIL IN MOST CASES. THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE OF COST FACTORS. THOSE FACTORS ALONE ARE MAKING IT GREATER POSSIBILITIES FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS HURTING AS. WERE CONSUMING 16% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN HEALTH-CARE COSTS. THAT NUMBER COULD VERY EASILY JUMP TO 20 OR 25% VERY QUICKLY. THAT BECAUSE ALMOST AN UNSUSTAINABLE NO. NOT TO MENTION THAT THAT CLEARLY THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM TODAY WITH A NUMBER THAT ARE GROWING. THE IRONY HERE, WILL HAVE HEALTH CARE COSTS RISE AND THE NUMBER OF INSURED CONTINUE TO RISE. NOW WE HAVE 1 MILLION MORE PEOPLE THAN WE DID SIX YEARS AGO UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT HAVE NO HEALTH CARE AND THAT COSTS CONTINUE TO GO UP. THE CLIMATE IS A LOT BETTER FOR US TODAY. I AM NOT ENGAGING IN SOMETHING INCONCEIVABLE HERE. UNGENERIS 21, THE DAY AFTER MY BE INAUGURATED, I COULD INVITE LILLY AND CHUCK GRASSLEY, MAX BAUCUS, TED STEVENS. I AM TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE CONGRESS FOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMMITTEES THAT DEAL WITH HEALTH CARE. I HAVE KNOWN EVERY ONE OF THEM FOR 30 YEARS. NOT GOING TO SPEND A YEAR TO GETTING TO KNOW THEM. THEY KNOW ME, I KNOW THEM. WE FOUGHT AGAINST EACH OTHER, WITH WORK TOGETHER ON ISSUES. I BELIEVE BY BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SAY LET'S GIVE THIS DONE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT NOTHING LESS OF US. WE NEED TO STOP TALKING AND CHIEF THE RESULTS I THINK WE CAN HAVE. >> THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> SINCE 1994 WHEN EFFORTS -- THIS COULD HELP WITH THE ISSUES WERE HAVING. >> IS IS WORKING NOW? >> SINCE 1994 WHEN HEALTH CARE REFORM CRASHED AND BURNED, CONGRESS HAS SORT OF LIMITED ITSELF TO INCREMENTAL STEPS. YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THOSE. RIGHT NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ON PACK MORE, WHO IS AT OUR END AT YOU AND SEE, TO ASK YOU AND IT ABOUT AN ISSUE BEEN ACTIVE INCOME WHICH IS EXPANDING COVERAGE OF CHILDREN. PAT, ARE YOU HERE? WHERE HAVING MICROPHONE GREMLINS ARE WE? >> HELLO? >> TO MANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TALKING HERE. >> I AM PATMORE. THE STATE OF NEVADA WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH NUMBER OF UNINSURED CHILDREN. IT IS REALLY DISCOURAGING TO ME BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A PEDIATRIC I SEE YOU NURSE AT IMC, THE ONLY PUBLIC ON COUNTY HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN NEVADA. I SEE THE RESULTS OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PARENTS CANNOT PROVIDE OR SEEK ENTER THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND RELATIVES TOO LATE, WHEN OFTENTIMES THE RESULT IS THE DEATH OF THE CHILD. SO I WOULD ASK YOU, WHAT IS YOUR PROPOSAL, WHAT IS YOUR PLATFORM FOR ENSURING EVERY CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES? >> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR WHAT DO YOU DO AS SINNERS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE QUESTION TO POINT OUT AS WELL THAT ON THIS TUESDAY, I WILL BE INTRODUCING SOMETHING CALLED A RESPECT ACT, WHICH TAKES THESE KENTUCKY RIVER CASES, THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THESE QUESTIONS UNDERSTAND, THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD LAST YEAR DECLARED THAT ANYONE WHO WAS VOCATIONALLY A SUPERVISOR AS A NURSE WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. MY LEGISLATION OVERTURNS THAT. I THINK NURSES OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE COLLECTIVELY. AGAIN, WHAT TO THINK YOUR, THE AFL-CIO AND OTHERS ENDORSING THE LEGISLATION, KENNEDY SERVING -- AND THERE SHORTAGE ISSUE, HOW NURSES GET TREATED IS SOMETHING THAT HAS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN MY VIEW IN THE COUNTRY. I APPRECIATE YOU BRING UP THE CHILDREN'S ISSUE. I STARTED THE CHILDRENS CAUCUS IN THE SENATE WITH ARLEN SPECTER ARE. 12 MILLION UNINSURED CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY. AS GIPP PROGRAM IS SOMETHING I WAS A STRONG BACKER AND SUPPORTER OF. TO PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS. IN THAT WHEN THE FIRST CAME UP I HAVE SOME HESITANCY. ALL THIS DIDN'T TALKING ABOUT THIS. HAD THE FEELING IF WE JUST TOOK CARE OF CHILDREN, WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO DO WITH THE BROADER POPULATION. RANKLY THINGS WERE MOVING SO SLOWLY BESIDE A WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO DIRECTLY REACH OUT AND SEE TO LET THE CHILDREN WERE GETTING A FAR BETTER START IN ALL THIS. IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WOULD GET RID OF%, THREE ENDEAVOUR SAID THE PARTY WOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER MEDICAID. THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. C. EVERETT COOP -- I VOTED AGAINST WHEN HE WAS NOMINATE TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE I DID YOU READ WITH A LOT OF HIS VIEWS. HE BECAME A BEST WITNESS. THAT WAS THE RADICAL IDEA YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND TIME WITH A CHILD WITHOUT HAVING TO LOSE YOUR JOB. WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT WITH PAID LEAVE FOR PEOPLE BY THE WAY OUT HERE. BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN DURING THOSE PERIODS OF ILLNESS MCKIE HUGE DIFFERENCE. I SEE YOUR NOTTING AND YOU UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER THAN OTHERS AS A PEDIATRIC NURSE. I THINK THE AMERICAN -- GETTING INTO SOME OF THIS THAT EARLY ON. I WANT TO SEE SCHOOL BASED CLINICS IN OUR COUNTRY. I WANT TO SEE HEAD START PROGRAM THAT IS NOT JUST A LITERACY PROGRAM THAT DEALS WITH THE WHOLE CHILD. ALL OF THE BASIC THINGS, THE INVESTMENTS NOT TO BE MAKING. I AM GRACIA BEEN CHOSEN BY THE HEAD START ASSOCIATION AS A CENTER OF THE DECADE WHEN IT COMES TO A HEAD START ISSUES. I WERE THAT BAD. VERY PROUDLY. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH NEED TO BE DOING. THE ADVANCE SCREENING LEGISLATION THAT I HAVE OFFERED, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR CHILDREN, BETTER TESTING FOR THEM. WE JUST DID A MAJOR BELLAND AUTISM IN THE COUNTRY FOR CHILDREN AS WELL. I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MY TIME WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. WHEN I GOT TO THE SENATE I DISCOVERED A CAUCUS FOR EVERY CONSTITUENCY IN THE COUNTRY EXCEPT ONE OF FOUR AMERICANS TO OUR KIDS. THAT IS THE REASON IT WAS SO MUCH TIME ON IT AND I WILL AS PRESIDENT AS UNITED STATES AS WELL. I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT IT. .. >> ARE INCENTIVES FOR DRIVING UP COST. WE NEED TO REVERSE THIS AND TURN THE WHOLE SYSTEM ON ITS HEAD. IF ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TINKERING WITH THE STATUS QUO, ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MARGINALLY ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. I'M FEARFUL WE'LL BE BACK HERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SUBJECT ALL OVER AGAIN. ALL THE INCENTIVES TODAY IN HEALTH CARE ARE COST DRIVEN. WE DON'T PROVIDE THE INCENTIVES TO DO JUST THE OPPOSITE, TO ENCOURAGE THE INCENTIVES TO HAVE PROSECUTOR LIFESTYLES, TO DO THINGS THAT ARE LESS HARMFUL, TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTS. I COME BACK TO THE POINT I MADE EARLIER, THE INCENTIVES TO HAVE CLEANER ENVIRONMENT, BETTER ENERGY POLICY IN THE COUNTRY. SEEING TO IT THAT WE INSIST ON SCHOOLS, FOR INSTANCE, THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MARKET FAST FOOD OR JUNK FOOD. 49% OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE CONTRACTS WITH SOFT DRINK COMPANIES AND JUNK FOOD COMPANIES. 49%, AND THEN WE WONDER WHY KIDS HAVE OBESITY PROBLEMS AND DIABETES PROBLEMS: SO THE COST ISSUE, THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THE MONEY COME INTO A POOR SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET, SO THAT EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT IS VERY APPEALING TO THEM TO SAVE SOME MONEY. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THOSE UNDERLYING ISSUES IN MY VIEW AS WELL. SO COST I WOULD PICK AS THE MAJOR ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] >> AND GIVEN THIS PROBLEM IS WHAT IT IS AND THE URGENCY THAT PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT IT, WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF WHAT IS A REALISTIC TIME FRAME FOR GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. BARACK OBAMA SAYS IT'S FOUR YEARS, HILLARY CLINTON SAYS IT'S EIGHT YEARS. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M IMPATIENT ON. THIS I DIDN'T JUMP INTO THIS PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS BECAUSE I WOKE UP WHEN I WAS FIVE OR TEN AND DECIDED THIS WAS MY LIFE AMBITION. I'VE BEEN RELATIVELY HAPPY IN THE SENATE. I'VE GOT THESE TWO KIDS. A LATE BLOOMER. >> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? >> MY DAUGHTER GRACE WAS BORN 48 HOURS AFTER 9/11. YOU COULD LITERALLY WATCH THE PENTAGON BURNING. AND I'VE THOUGHT EVER SINCE THAT MOMENT, AS ALL OF YOU PARENT,S OR GRANDPARENTS. WHAT KIND OF A WORLD IS SHE GOING TO GROW UP IN? I FEEL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMPATIENT. I THINK WITH THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP THAT INSISTS UPON THIS BEING A PRIORITY, AND I WOULD TELL YOU I WOULDN'T PUT A TIME FRAME ON THIS, BUT I WOULD MAKE THIS THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IN A DODD ADMINISTRATION. THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE, IT GOES FAR BEYOND THE ISSUE OF ONE SET OF ISSUES. THE DANGER IN FORUMS LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO STOVE PIPE THE ISSUES. WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WHAT I TRY TODAY SAY EARLIER IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORKPLACE IN TERMS OF JOB POSSIBILITIES, INCOME, SALARIES, RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE AS WELL. ENERGY POLICY, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH CARE POLICY. SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THIS DISCUSSION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE IT'S FAR REACHING IN ITS IMPLICATIONS. I WOULD WANT TO SEE US HAVE A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM BEGINNING FAR SOONER THAN FOUR YEARS. IF YOU CAN HAVE, YOU GET RID OF THESE PERMANENT TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP 1% OF -- GET THIS WAR ENDED IN IRAQ WHERE WE'RE SPENDING $8 BILLION A MONTH, IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO MOVE IT IN THAT DIRECTION. I WON'T WANT TO PUT A TIME FRAME ON IT. >> GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION. KANE, THANKS. >> AND THAT IS SENATOR CHRIS DODD WRAPPING UP. HE SAYS FIXING THE HEALTH CARE PROBLEM -- >> NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM CONGRESSMAN DENNIS KUCINICH. THANK YOU. >> GOOD AFTERNOON. [APPLAUSE] IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE WITH YOU. AND AS I'M LISTENING TO THIS DISCUSSION TODAY, IT REMINDS ME THAT YOU ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO INSIST THAT AMERICA RECONNECT WITH ITS GREATNESS AND ITS GOODNESS. YESTERDAY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AMERICANS WERE TOLD THAT WE CAN'T HAVE PEACE, WE HAVE TO KEEP A WAR GOING FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO IN ORDER TO HAVE PEACE. I VOTED AGAINST THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE A NEW DIRECTION WHICH SAY IFS YOU WANT PEACE, YOU VOTE FOR PEACE, AND YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR POSSESSION. WE'RE BEING TOLD IN THIS STATE AND OTHER POLICE STATIONS THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE KINDERGARTEN CARE OR UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN CARE, AND YET WHEN YOU ACCEPT THAT, THEN YOU DON'T GET IT. EFFORTS ARE MADE TO JUST CUT SHORT A MOVEMENT. TODAY AT THIS FORUM, THE SUBMESSAGE IS THAT YOU CAN'T BREAK THE HOLD THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE. NOT A SINGLE CANDIDATE UP HERE HAS CHALLENGED THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND THAT IS INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE HOLDING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HOSTAGE AND FORCING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS INTO POVERTY WITH UNCONSCIONABLE PREMIUM, CO-PAYS, DEDUCTIBLES. [APPLAUSE] SO I ASK YOU, IS IT CONSONANT WITH AMERICA'S GREATNESS THAT CANDIDATES STEP AWAY FROM THE ONE SOLUTION THAT COULD CHANGE IT ALL? A NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE, BUT HR676, A BILL THAT I'VE INTRODUCED IN A NUMBER OF CONGRESSES, THE CONYERS/KUCINICH BILL, ACTUALLY ESTABLISHES MEDICARE FOR ALL. A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM, AND IT'S A NOT FOR PROFIT SYSTEM. IT'S TIME WE ENDED THIS THOUGHT THAT HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. IT IS A BASIC RIGHT, AND IT'S TIME WE ENDED THE CONTROL THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE NOT ONLY OVER HEALTH CARE BUT OVER OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] THINK FOR A MOMENT IF LINCOLN HAD DECIDED, WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH RESISTANCE TO THIS IDEA OF EMANCIPATION. THINK IF THE SUFFRAGE ETS HAD DECIDEED, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T TAKE ON THESE MEN WHO ARE DETERMINED NOT TO INCLUDE WOMEN IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. WHAT IF MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD SAID, YOU KNOW, WE CAN ONLY PUSH SO FAR FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, OR IN CEASE STAR CHAVEZ HAD SAID NO PUEDE? WHAT IF WE BUY INTO THIS LOGIC THAT SAYS WE CAN'T HAVE PEACE? WE'RINGBEING TOLD TO BUY INTO A VIEW OF THE WORLD THAT SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES RUN THE SYSTEM, WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL WORK OUT COMPETITION BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. WHERE'S OUR CALL FOR GREATNESS? WHAT IF FDR HAD SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T REALLY DO THE NEW DEAL. I'M TALKING ABOUT A REAL DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A. UNIVERSE AGO, SINGLE-PAYER, NOT FOR PROFIT, MEDICARE FOR ALL, AND IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE WITH YOU TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S ALREADY IN LEGISLATIVE FORM. 62 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE SIGNED ON TO BILL. OVER 14,000 PHYSICIANS HAVE SIGNED ON TO THE BILL, THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR A PLAN JUST LIKE IT, THE SENATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ENDORSED IT THE OTHER DAY, THE LEGISLATURE IN KANSAS PUT THEIR NAME ON IT AND ENDORSED THE IDEA. WE CAN DO THIS. YES, WE CAN, BREAK THE HOLD OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND LIFT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. THAT'S WHAT MY PRESIDENCY IS GOING TO BE ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. SO LET'S TALK. >> SURE. >> LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION. >> WELL, CONGRESSMAN, TOUGH FIRST ADVOCATE WE'VE HEARD TODAY OF A SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ESSENTIALLY MEDICARE FOR EVERYBODY. HOWEVER, THE LAST TIME, MY UNDERSTANDING IS, THAT IT WAS ON THE BALLOT WAS IN OREGON, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, IF NOT -- EXCEPT FOR VERMONT PROBABLY THE MOST LIBERAL STATE IN THE COUNTRY ON THESE ISSUES, AND IT DIDN'T PASS. WHERE DO YOU FIND THE POLITICAL WILL FOR A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM? >> I TRAVEL THIS COUNTRY IN THE LAST ELECTION, CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT HEALTH CARE IS THE ONE ISSUE THAT UNITES EVERYONE. WHERE DOES THE SUPPORT COME? FOR A NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM? IT COMES FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, BUT IT'S WAITING FOR A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEAD THE WAY, AND I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT. HR676 IS THE VEHICLE. NOW, HOW CAN YOU BREAK THE HOLD THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE, BECAUSE, LET'S FACE IT, IN OREGON THEY PUMPED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO TRY TO DEFEAT THE INITIATIVE. THIS IS REALLY SIMPLE. YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T HAVE STRINGS ATTACHED, SOMEONE WHO IS READY TO CON FRONT THESE INSURANCE INDUSTRIES, SOMEONE WHO ISN'T OWNED BY THE INTEREST. RIGHT NOW IN WALL STREET THESE HEDGE FUNDS ARE COMING TOGETHER POURING MILLIONS INTO THE CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT. WE'RE LOOKING AT A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU THE WORDS YOU WANT TO HEAR, BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SPECIFICS IN A PLAN, THEY'RE NOT DEVELOPING IT. WHY CAN I DO IT? SIMPLY, I HAVE NO STRINGS ATTACHED. I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS 40 YEARS. I'VE BEEN A COUNCILMAN, A CLERK OF COURT A MAJOR, I'M KNOWN FOR HAVING INTEGRITY AND A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE A STAND, AND FOR CHANGING THE OUTCOME WHEN OTHERS SAY IT CAN'T BE DONE. THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT I CALL UPON YOU AND THE SEIU AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SAY LET'S JOIN THIS MOVEMENT THAT ALREADY EXISTS, CALL UPON THE POWER OF OUR HEARTS AND OUR INTE LEX. WHAT ARE THE ANIMATING FORCES? HOW'S THIS: HALF OF THE BANKRUPTCY IS IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW ARE DIRECTLY CONNECT TODAY PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS, AND OF THAT AMOUNT, 75% OF THE PEOPLE ARE WORKING. HAVE JOBS, PEOPLE'S WHOLE LIVES ARE ON THE LINE HERE. WILL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BE GIVE GIVEN THE CHOICE? THIS ISN'T ""AMERICAN IDOL"" HERE. I MEAN, REALLY. I COULD COME UP HERE AND DO A LITTLE DANCE ABOUT, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES. OH, REALLY? ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE AWAY THEIR PROFITS? ARE YOU GOING TO REMOVE THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? 31% OF THE MONEY THAT'S IN THE SYSTEM NOW OF $2.2 TRILLION A YEAR GOES FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE FOR-PROFIT SYSTEM. IF WE TAKE THAT MONEY AWAY FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND USE IT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WELL, GUESS WHAT? WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR VISION CARE, DENTAL CARE, MENTAL HEALTH, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, AND LONG-TERM CARE. I'M GOING TO CALL ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHT. HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, NOT AS A PRIVILEGE. [APPLAUSE] >> WELL, CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE AN E-MAIL QUESTION FROM JAMES IN PATTERSON, CALIFORNIA, WHO WANTS TO KNOW WHY ARE HEALTH CARE COSTS GOING UP SO MUCH, AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP THESE INCREASES? COULD I JUST ADD A QUESTION TO THAT? >> OF COURSE. >> BECAUSE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM, PEOPLE SAY THE CONSEQUENCE OF TRYING TO CONTAIN COSTS IN A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM WOULD ULTIMATELY BE RATIONING. SO COULD YOU TAKE US THROUGH, FIRST, HOW A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM WOULD ADDRESS COSTS, AND ALSO WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THESE SORTS OF CONCERN THAT IS PEOPLE RAISE ABOUT IT? >> YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT THIS, NOW, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHEN THEY LOOK AT A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM, A NOT FOR PROFIT SYSTEM, THEY'LL SAY, MY GOD, YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH RATIONING. WHAT DO WE HAVE NOW? 46 MILLION AMERICANS DON'T EVEN HAVE COVERAGE. TALK ABOUT RATIONING? THEY'RE NOT EVEN IN THE LINE. OKAY? GIVE ME MY PORTION. ANOTHER 50 MILLION PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY COVERAGE, ARE UNDERINSURED, AND THE REST ARE PAYING THESE HIGH PREMIUMS CONSCIOUS-PAYS, AND DEDUCTIBLE TES. WE'VE GOT TO WREAK THE HOLD THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS PLAN THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT COVERS EVERYONE. HOW DO YOU REDUCE COSTS? LESS LOOK AT THE COSTS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. CORPORATE PROFITS, STOCK OPTIONS, EXECUTIVE SALARIES, ADVERTISING, MARKETING, THE COST OF PAPER WORK, ALL THIS TAKES ABOUT 31% OUT OF THE HEALTH CARE DOLLAR. NOW, WHAT DOES ALL THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE? ZERO. ZIP. THAD DA. I'M TALKING ABOUT CREATING A SYSTEM WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS SIMILAR TO THAT IN EVERY OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD. WE TAKE THE PROFIT OUT OF MEDICINE. HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, IT IS NOT A PRIVILEGE, SO HOW DO WE CONTROL COSTS? BY HAVING EVERYONE IN THE SAME POOL, EVERYONE, HAVING EVERYONE COVERED, AND HAVING THE BENEFITS BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WHATEVER THEIR INCOME, NO MEANS TESTING, AND BY CREATING A MOVEMENT. NOW, I WANT TO ADD SOMETHING TO AN EARLIER QUESTION YOU RAISED, AND THAT IS THAT -- AND, YOU KNOW, MY GOOD FRIEND SENATOR EDWARDS WHO HE AND I CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER FOUR YEARS AGO, HE RAISED THIS QUESTION, WHICH IS A VERY, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS THE QUESTION IN WASHINGTON. IT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE TO TAKE THIS PLAN FOR NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE. SENATOR CLINTON TALKED ABOUT INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT DOESN'T REALLY GET TO THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE, WHO CONTROLS HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA. SENATOR OBAMA'S STILL DEVELOPING HIS PLAN. THIS PLAN THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, I CO-AUTHORED THIS PLAN. I'M ONE OF THE ONE WHO IS WROTE THE PLAN. I KNOW THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS SET UP. THE AREA THAT I FLEPT CLEVELAND, PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THE DOCTOR BILLS. AND SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IT ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO S WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND THE WILLINGNESS TO TAKE A STAND AND CAN REACH OUT TO THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THE AMERICAN SCHEME CALL FORTH OUR GREAT TONS SAY WE'RE GOING CHANGE THIS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TRAPPED BY THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO GIVE US DIMINISHING RETURNS, WHO INSIST ON HIGHER PREMIUMS CONSCIOUS-PAYS, AND DEDUCTIBLES. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. CONGRESSMAN, YOU'RE KIND OF AN URBAN KIND OF GUY, AND ASHLEY OS BORN WHO IS A LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSE IN EL COA, WHICH IS A RURAL COUNTY IN NORTHERN NEVADA A QUESTION FOR YOU ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD ADDRESS CONCERNS IN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HER SITUATION. >> GOOD MORNING. AS YOU KNOW MY NAME'S ASHLEY OS BORN, AND I'M A LABOR NURSE IN NEVADA A RURAL AREA UP IN NORTH EASTERN NEVADA. COMMONLY I SEE MOMS COME IN TO MY DEPARTMENT WITH PREGNANCY-INDUCED, SEVERE PREGNANCY-INDUCED HEALTH CARE ISSUES THAT COULD BE ELIMINATED OR CAUGHT EARLY WITH PRENATAL CARE. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE UNABLE TO GET THAT. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS ON IMPROVING HEALTH CARE IN THE RURAL AREA IN THE U.S.? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THIS PLAN COVERS EVERYONE. AND RURAL AS WELL AS URBAN AREAS ALIKE. RURAL AREAS TEND TO BE UNDERSERVED. I'M LOOKING ALSO AT CREATING AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, WHICH WOULD BUILD HOSPITALS IN RURAL AREAS. AND RURAL PEOPLE WOULD THEN HAVE ACCESS, BECAUSE ACCESS IS THE HUGE QUESTION IN RURAL AREAS, AND WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT WOMENNINGBEING ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED, THIS SYSTEM, PRENATAL CARE, POSTTHAT ITAL CARE. THIS SYSTEM OF NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE DOESN'T TRY TO STOP WOMEN FROM GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE THERE'S AN INSURANCE AGENT TELLING A DOCTOR, YOU KNOW, AN OBGYN YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT. YOU'RE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH. THIS SYSTEM WILL MEET THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'RE BEING TOLD WE JUST CAN'T HAVE THOSE NEEDS MET. WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING DIFFERENTLY. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> THANKS, AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO A PUBLIC HEALTH STUDENT HERE AT UNLV, MEGAN McCORPS MACK WHO RAISES A PERTINENT POINT. I MEAN, IF THERE'S ANY PLACE WHERE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN OUTCOMES, IT'S IN MECHANIC. MEGAN? >> HELLO, RIGHT HERE. I'M A JUNIOR AT UNLV HERE. WE'RE SPENDING AN INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ON HEALTH CARE WHILE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE POOR OUTCOMES. THOSE COUNTRIES WHO ARE ALLOCATING A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR GDP TOWARDS HEALTH CARE. HOW DOES AMERICA PLAN TO STAY GLOBALLY PETTIVE WITH INCREASING HEALTH CARE COSTS? >> THAT IS A KEY QUESTION. IN MY OWN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WE HAVE AUTO PLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN THREATENED BECAUSE THE HIGH COST 06 HEALTH CARE IS CAUSING FORD AND GM TO PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF HEALTH CARE. NOW CANDAY, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS A MUST'VE STRONGER INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR THEIR PEOPLE. THIS PLAN THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO HELP AMERICAN BUSINESS. IT'S GOING TO STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY, IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HOLD ON TO MORE MUFNLT MANY FAMILIES ARE SPENDING IN EXCESSOVER $10,000 A YEAR FOR HEALTH CARE. WITH THIS PLAN ONLY A FRACTION OF THE MONEY THAT IS BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW WOULD HAVE TO BE PART OF THE FINANCING OF THE SYSTEM. I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW THAT 60% RIGHT NOW OF THE MONEY THAT'S IN HEALTH CARE IS SPENT BY THE GOVERNMENT? THE GOVERNMENT HAS 60% OF THE SPENDING RIGHT NOW. IF YO ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, IF YOU PURCHASE BULK PURCHASE OF DRUGS JUST THE WAY VETERANS DO, YOU START TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY THAT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE, AND THAT IS A MAJOR HELP FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND LARGE BUSINESSES ALIKE. THIS PATCHWORK PROPOSAL THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN HERE TODAY BY OTHER CANDIDATES LOCKS US INTO INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO THEN TAKE THEIR POUND OF FLESH AND GENERALLY IT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN BUDGETS. I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT MOST AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE MECHANIC SYSTEM IS SET UP. PEOPLE THAT ARE AWARE THAT IF THEY HAVE AN ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY, IT COULD WIPE THEM OUT. YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE HAVE TO LOSE THEIR HOME IN ORDER TO INSURE THE HEALTH OF A LOVED ONE? WHY SHOULD SOMEONE NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE LONG-TERM CARE THEY NEED FOR A LOVED ONE OR HAVE TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE TO GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED FOR FOR A LIFETIME IN ORDER TO GET THE LONG-TERM CARE YOU NEED? WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A REAL TRANSFORMATION. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THAT, BUT THEY NEED SOMEONE TO BE NOT JUST THE MESSENGER, BUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THIS ISSUE, AND IS READY TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT. YES, WE CAN IMPROVE OUR ECONOMY AND SAVE OUR BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL, AND I'M DEDICATED TO DO THAT, AND I'M ABLE TO DO IT TOO. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN. EARLIER SENATOR EDWARDS POINTED OUT THAT THERETO A SINGLE-PAYER, MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION BUILT INTO HIS PLAN. AND IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE COULD CONSIDER IN MAKING THEIR HEALTH CARE CHOICES, AND HE RAISED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF THAT WERE OUT THERE AS AN OPTION AND PEOPLE STARTED CHOOSING IT AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY REALLY LIKED IT, THAT THE COUNTRY COULD ALMOST, YOU KNOW, EVOLVE TOWARD A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM. DO YOU SEE THIS AS A REAL SCENARIO GIVEN THE ORE INTERESTS THAT ARE OUT THERE? OR DO YOU THINK THAT, IN FACT, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO SORT OF COME DOWN IN ONE FELL SWOOP IF IT'S EVER GOING TO HAPPEN? >> WELL, YOU JUST ANSWERED THE QUESTION, AND THAT IS IF YOU HAVE COMPETITION BETWEEN INSURANCE COMPANIES, EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. THAT DOESN'T DRIVE COSTS, IT DRIVES UP PROFITS. THAT'S THE FACT. IF YAW SAY, WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHOICE, EITHER BE ON A PRIVATE PLAN OR BE WITH THE GOVERNMENT, WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE PRIVATE COMPANIES START CHERRY PICKING THE BEST, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE IN THE BEST HEALTH AND THEN YOU END UP WITH WHAT'S CALLED ADVERSE SELECTION, THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST MEDICALLY COMPROMISED END UP ON PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PAYING FOR. AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM STARTS TO GO DOWN. YOU END UP IN AN INSURANCE DEATH SPIRAL, WHAT IT'S CALLED IN THE INDUSTRY. THINK ABOUT IT, CANDIDATES ARE UP HERE ADVOCATING THAT GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I MEAN, DIDN'T WE HAVE ENOUGH OF SUBSIDIZING THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WITH THAT PHONY MEDICARE D PROGRAM THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD? HOW ARE WE ANY DIFFERENT AS DEMOCRATS? THINK ABOUT THAT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, OH, EVERYBODY'S FOR IT IT'S RESONANT WITH THAT FELLA IN THE MUSIC MAN WHO SAYS THERE'S TROUBLE IN RIVER CITY. UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, YOU KNOW WHAT? EVEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. ESPECIALLY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IF THE GOVERNMENT'S SUBSIDIZING THEM WHAT A DEAL THAT IS FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT WHAT A ROTTEN DEAL IT IS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE, GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THE PICTURE. HEALTH CARE IS NOT A PRIVILEGE, IT IS A RIGHT, AND IT IS A HUMAN RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, RIGHT. I MEAN, COME ON. YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T FALL OFF A CHRISTMAS TREE. YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BE INVOLVED IN STRAIGHT TALK STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER, AND YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T HAVE A KEY IN THE BACK BEING WOUND UP BY SPECIAL INTERESTS TO COME BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TELL THEM WATCH THE INTERESTS WANT. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, AND I'M READY TO TAKE THAT MESSAGE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I'D LIKE YOUR HELP IN DOING IT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE FOUR SECONDS LEFT. BUZZER SHOT, YOU WANT NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE, I'M THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN DELIVER. CUSHION NICHE.U.S. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CONGRESSMAN. >> AND THAT IS DENNIS KUCINICH GETTING AN ENTHUSIASTIC SENDOFF CALLING FOR A NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE U.S. >> NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL CANDIDATE OF THE DAY, FORMER ALASKA SENATOR MIKE GRAVEL. >> PLEASURE MEETING YOU. HI, ALL. I JUST WANT TO GIVE MY CONDOLENCES TO ALL OF YOU WHO REALIZE THAT SOMETHING SAD HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. THE REBELS LOTS BY FOUR POINTS. [APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ANDY IS SITTING OVER THERE, OKAY, ANDY, YOU SPEAK GOOD ENGLISH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THESE CANDIDATES DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME HERE. THAT'S BETTER THAN WHAT CNN IS GOING TO DO TO ME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BY CENSORING MY VOICE. BUT LET ME SAY THAT ANDY POINTED OUT ONE THING RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, AND THAT IS WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM, AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOUR TIME. YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO, AND BEV HEARD A LOT OF ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES AND DEEP EMOTIONS ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION. THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT WE'VE SADDLED THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH CARRYING IT. AND YOU CAN'T DO IT, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO COST YOU YOUR JOBS, IT'S GOING TO DAMAGE YOU INTERNATIONALLY. CARE REP WAS ELUDING TO IT. HISTORICAL ACCIDENT N A SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN WAGE WERE FROZEN, THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD GET PEOPLE TO ROOMINTO YOUR COMPANY AND WORK WAS TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. THE WAR'S OVER, WE DON'T HAVE ANY FREEZE ON WAGES, SO WE DON'T NEED THAT SYSTEM TO GO AHEAD AND CARRY, AND IF YOU HEARD ALL OF THE PLANS, THEY ESSENTIALLY, EXCEPT FOR DENNIS'S, THEY WERE ALL INVOLVING EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. THAT IS A NONSTARTER, AND IT'S A BAND-AID THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. NOW, WHAT IS, WHAT CAN WE DO? WELL, WE CAN REAL SIMPLE, WE CAN TURN AROUND AND SAY LET US HAVE A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THAT ESTABLISHES EQUALITY AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE NAME OF IT. IT'S CALLED THE UNIVERSE AGO, SINGLE-PAYER, I MEAN ALL AMERICANS PAY FOR IT REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEMS YOU HAVE NOW OR THE SYSTEMS YOU'RE GOING TO GET. HEALTH CARE VENNTURE, VOUCHER PLAN. UNDER THE PLAN WE WOULD ISSUE VOUCHERS TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN AND THE VOACHERS, YOU DON'T PAY FOR THEM, THEY'RE ISSUED TO YOU. AND YOU SIGN UP EVERY YEAR FOR THEM. AND THEY'LL HAVE A VERY MODEST CO-PAY, A VERY MODEST DEDUCTIBLE, BLUE THAT'S IT. EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME PRODUCT. UNIVERSEALLY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THEN IF YOU WANT MORE THAN THE PRODUCT YOU'VE GOT, YOU PAY FOR IT. THERE'S NO IMAGINE NICK THIS WHOLE PROCESS. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PAY, YOU KNOW WHO PAYS? IT'S THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. PARTICULARLY UNDER OUR PRESENT SYSTEM. AND SO TO WANT TO TRASH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND TRASH OUR TAX SYSTEM, WHICH IS ALREADY CORRUPT, WITH GREATER CORRUPTION AS A WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS A NONSTARTER. WHEN THEY TELL YOU ABOUT, OH, I'VE DONE THIS, DONE THAT, KEEP IN MIND HARRY TRUMAN WAS THE FIRST TO RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH THE DEMOCRATS, AND THEY DIDN'T DO IT. AND WE HAVEN'T DONE IT SINCE. AND SO IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BAND-AID, ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER. NOW, WITH THESE VOUCHERS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE CHOICE. CHOICE OF DOCTORS, CHOICE OF HOSPITALS, FREE CHOICE. NOW, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ALSO HAVE A CHOICE OF MAYBE NO MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX PLANS, INSURANCE PLANS. NOW, I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS WITH THE PREDATOR ACTIVITIES UNDER OUR PRESENT MERCANTILE SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR LOBBYISTS, 30,000 OF THEM IN WASHINGTON, GO OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR CLIENTS. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME CHANGES MAYBE IN THE FUTURE. IT DEPENDS ON HOW THIS IS ENACTED INTO LAW. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENACTED BY THE CONGRESS. DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH ON THAT. PLEASE, NEVER WILL HAPPEN. FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT THERE'S TOO MANY INTERESTS. 30,000 LOBBYISTS. WHO DO YOU THINK'S BUNDLING ALL THESE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES? YOU THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE HOLY TRINITY? MY GOD, IT'S COMING FROM VITAL SPECIAL INTERESTS WHETHER THEY'RE FOR DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE FACED WITH. SO NOW YOU CAN HAVE A VOUCHER. YOU'VE GOT THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE. YOU'VE GOT THE FLEE.COM OF CHOSE OF PLANS, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A PUBLIC PLAN IF WE DON'T SEE THE INDUSTRY R INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SHAPING UP. SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADMINISTER IT? LET'S HAVE LIKE THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. LET'S HAVE A CENTRAL BODY WITH REGIONAL BOARDS THAT THEY WOULD THEN DEFINE WHAT THE VARIOUS VOUCHERS ARE FOR. AND THE VOUCHERS ARE SET UP FOR RISK. ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NOT ON A CORRECTIVE THIS FITS ALL. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE A COST OF MORE THAN $3,000. WHEN YOU'RE MY AGE, IT COULD BE $150,000-$180,000 IN ONE YEAR WHICH IS WHAT I GOT HIT WITH, AND I WENT BANKRUPT AS A RESULT OF THAT. I KNOW THIS SYSTEM. I GET ME MIDS FROM THE VA, AND I GET THE REST FROM MEDICARE. SO I KNOW THE SYSTEM UP FRONT AND PERSONAL. AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOMEBODY I MET IN IOWA WHO WAS CRYING ON MY SHOULDER. [APPLAUSE] LET ME POINT OUT TO YOU, LET ME POINT OUT TO YOU SO WHAT ARE HAPPEN, I'M TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- OR THEY SAY ELECTRONIC RECORDS. HELL, THAT'S NOTHING. WE HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ENTIRE HISTORY COMPUTERIZED AND EVERY PENNY THAT'S SPENT ON YOUR HEALTH CARE COMPUTERIZED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WHEN WE'RE REALLY DESIGNING NEXT YEAR, WE'RE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND PROJECT, OH, YOU SPENT $3,000, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A VOUCHER FOR $3,000 NEXT YEAR. SUPPOSING YOU'VE GOT COLON CANCER AND IT'S GOING TO COST YOU $150,000 NEXT YEAR, THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SIZE OF YOUR VOUCHER. YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE DYNAMICS OF THIS. AND BY PUTTING IN WITH ONLY HAVING FIVE OR SIX PLANS, AND THE PLANS WE DETERMINE. AND THERE'LL BE NO LEMON DROPPING. THERE'LL BE NO, WELL, YOU DON'T QUALIFY, YOU'VE GOT A PREEXISTING CONDITION. THAT IS HISTORY UNDER THIS PLAN. AND SO THIS PLAN CAN WORK. ALL WE NEED TO DO, AND THEY SAY, OH, WEAVER GOT TO BRING THE PEOPLE IN. MY GOD BRING THE PEOPLE N. THEY'RE NOT BRINGING THE PEOPLE ANYWHERE. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO CREATE AN ATTITUDE OF, MY GOD, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING GREAT WITH THE PEOPLE. HELL, THE PEOPLE ARE NOT EMPOWERED TO DO ANYTHING. IN THE UNITED STATES MORE THAN HALF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MAKE LAWS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL? IF YOU DID, THEN OF COURSE, YOU COULD DECIDE WHAT IS THE HEALTH PLAN YOU WANT TO HAVE OR IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO PUT UP WITH THE BAND-AIDS WE'RE EXPERIENCING. HOW ARE WE GOING TO PAY FOR MY HEALTH CARE ANY WANT TO THANK MY ADVISERS, BOTH EXPERTS IN THE FIELD WHO HAVE BEEN ADVISING ME ON IT. THEY MAY BE ASHAMED AT THE WAY I PRESENT IT, BUT I THINK NOT. I THINK NOT. AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IF WE EMPOWER YOU, THEN YOU COULD MAKE THE DECISION AND NOT TRY TO -- STOP AND THINK WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. THEY'RE SAYING WE WANT YOU TO USE THE GOVERNMENT FOR YOUR BENEFIT. OKAY? WHY TOO FAR TO DO THAT? WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT DIRECTLY? YOU CAN, AND THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT. GO TO GRAVEL 08.U.S., AND YOU'LL SEE THE PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR. [APPLAUSE] IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PLAN THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING, IF I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT, HAS SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE SINGLE PAIR BUT ALSO SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. IT'S NOT A SORT OF TRADITIONAL PURE SINGLE-PAYER PLAN, AND YOU DESCRIBE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEVER COME FROM CONGRESS. SO COULD YOU DESCRIBE, AGAIN, THIS PROCESS BY WHICH -- WHAT KIND OF PROCESS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HERE? >> I'M TALKING ABOUT USING THE NATIONAL NICHE TI. FIRST, FOR THIS TO HAPPEN, AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE 10 YEARS FROM NOW, 15 YEARS FROM NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PROBLEM GETTING WORSE. IT'S GETTING WORSE ALL THE TIME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE CONGRESS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS? LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE LITERALLY BANKRUPT, AND NOBODY PAYS ANY ATTENTION TO IT. WE'VE GONE TO THESE CRAZY WARS. WE HAVE A NATION THAT'S CONTROLLED BY THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX THAT DICTATES WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUR LIVES, AND THE AMERICANS ARE JUST WHISTLING WALKING THROUGH THE CEMETERY. I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. >> THIS NATIONAL INITIATIVE, HOW DOES IT WORK? IT STARTS AS A PETITION? IT STARTS AS WHAT. >> I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS, BUT WHAWNS I'VE DONE IS I'VE COPIED THE PROCEDURES THAT I USED IN THE CONGRESS AND EVERY ELECTIVE BODY IN THE WORLD, AND I'VE PUT THEM INTO A LAW CALLED THE NATIONAL BALLOT INITIATIVE, AND THAT IS TO EQUIP EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO COME INTO THE OPERATION OF GOVERNMENT AS LAW MAKERS AND PARTNERS WITH THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. NOW, THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY. THIS IS OUT OF THE BOX. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? WE TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ISN'T THAT REVOLUTIONARY? WE TRUST THE PEOPLE. RATHER THAN THE OTHER POLITICIAN THAT IS SAY TRUST ME, I'LL GET ELECTED AND I'LL DO A JOB FOR YOU. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU, CAN'T BE DONE THAT WAY, AND WE HAVE HISTORIC PRECEDENT TO SHOW IT. IF THAT DOESN'T CONVINCE YOU THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE RIGHT DIRECTION ELECTING VARIOUS PERSONALITIES PRESIDENT,THE CHANGE LIES WITH YOU. NOT THE LEADERSHIP. THE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN SCREWING UP BY THE NUMBERS FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS. HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH YET? PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] >> WELL, SENATOR, THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT I HAD IN MY MIND ABOUT THIS, AND IT'S ADDRESSED MY BUN OF OUR QUESTIONERS IN THE AUDIENCE, AND INTERESTINGLY AT THIS VERY MOMENT A QUESTION OVER E-MAIL POPPED UP THAT ADDRESSED THE SAME ISSUE. YOU CRIEB THESE VOUCHERS AS ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS YOU HAVE. YOU NEED A HEART BYPASS, YOU GET A VOUCHER THAT COULD COVER IT. BUT MICHELLE IN IOWA ASKS HOW WOULD YOU INCREASE THE ROLE OF PREVENTION IN THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, AND I'D LIKE TO TURN TO BECKY -- WHO'S AN RN AT UH VALLEY HOSPITAL, ARE YOU HERE, BECKY? >> I AM HERE. I HAVE BEEN A NURSE FOR 37 YEARS, AND I HAVE SEEN PATIENTS COME IN TO THE HOSPITAL WITH MEDICAL PROBLEMS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF A DOCTOR HAD BEEN, HAD SEEN THIS PATIENT EARLY ON. AS PRESIDENT, HOW WILL YOU INSURE THAT MORE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE AND WELLNESS CARE IS PROVIDED NATIONWIDE? >> FIRST OFF, THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN HIS LEADERSHIP CAPACITY OR HER LEADERSHIP CAPACITY, AND THAT IS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. TO REALLY ENERGIZE PEOPLE TO EXERCISE. NOW, PEOPLE SAY AT MY AGE, YOU KNOW, I'M A GOOD EXAMPLE. I'VE HAD TWO MAJOR OPERATIONS, WELL, SEVERAL MAJOR OPERATIONS, BUT I'M IN GOOD SHAPE BECAUSE I EXERCISE. I TRY TO EAT THE RIGHT FOODS, AND SO I HAD A LADY ON THE PLANE SHOW ME THAT SHE COULD HAVE GOT THIS JUNK BAR FOR 50 CENTS, BUT THEY WERE ASKING FOR $1.25 FOR THE APPLE THAT SHE WAS HOLDING UP ABOUT TO EAT. DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF WHAT'S GOING ON? I MEAN, WE'RE ALL PATRIOTIC WHETHER IT'S IN BUSINESS OR LABOR, WE'RE ALL PATRIOTIC, BUT WE NEED A LEADERSHIP THAT SET ACETONE TO DEMAND FROM US THE BEST THAT'S IN US. AND WE RECOGNIZE THESE PROBLEMS. WE KNOW THE PROBLEM OF OBESITY. I TRY TO DIET ALL THE TIME. SOMETIMES SUCCESSFULLY, SOMETIMES NOT SO SUCCESSFULLY. BUT WHEN ALL YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION IS JUNK FOOD, YOU'VE GOT O A PROBLEM, AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN BULLY. YOU CAN SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO REGULATE ALL THIS, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN KATRINA? YOU'VE HEARD THE JOKE, I'M FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. WELL, THAT DOESN'T WORK. THE GOVERNMENT'S A TOOL. THE PEOPLE CAN USE IT. BUT IF THE PEOPLE HAVE THE DIRECT POWER TO USE IT, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SEE GOVERNMENT AS A REAL TOOL. NOT THE TOOL YOU HAVE WHERE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS DETERMINE HOW THE TOOL OF GOVERNMENT IS HANDLED BY THE LOBBYISTS WHO DO THE BUNDLING TO PAY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR THEIR CAMPAIGNS TO MANIPULATE YOU TO VOTE FOR THEM. THAT'S THE POSITIVE THAT WE LIVE UNDER, AND THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT HAS TO CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] >> OKAY. NEXT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO -- PAFL WHO'S A JANITOR IN CLARK COUNTY. ARE YOU HERE? I APOLOGIZE, UNIT EVEN COME CLOSE. I'M HALF THE TIME NULLITY, SO I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. >> THAT'S ALL RIGHT. MY NAME IS -- PALE, AND I'M AN SCIU MEMBER, AND I WORK AS A JANITOR. I'M ALSO A PRIMARY CAREGIVER FOR MY 78-YEAR-OLD MOTHER. MY MOTHER HAS MEDICARE AND THE PROBLEM LIES IN THAT THE PROVIDERS WILL NOT USE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND TREATMENTS THAT WILL DIAGNOSE HER SOONER AND TREAT THE PROBLEM FASTER. QUESTION IS, SIR, WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR PROVIDING PREVENTIVE AND DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES IN HEALTH CARE FOR OUR SENIORS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND ALL AMERICANS? >> ONE OF THE FACETS OF THE PLAN WOULD BE TO KEEP IN PLACE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND PHASE THEM OUT OVER TIME. BECAUSE PLANS TO PUT EVERYBODY ON MED MEDICARE AREN'T GOING TO FLY FINANCIALLY AND JUST CAN'T BE MET. AND SO THEY CAN TELL YOU THEY CAN, BUT THEY CAN'T BE MET. WE ARE IN DEEP ECONOMIC DIFFICULTY AND IN DEBT. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SENIORS, THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE THESE HEALTH REGIONAL BOARDS WHERE N THAT REGION, THEY WILL BE DEFINING WHAT GOES INTO THE VARIOUS VOUCHERS. AND THEY'LL CHANGE EVERY YEAR DEPENDING UPON YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY AS YOU GET OLDER. AND WE KNOW IT COSTS LESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND IT COSTS MORE FOR OLD PEOPLE. THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE SITUATION. SO I DON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC TO TAKE CARE OF THE SENIORS. ALL I CAN SAY IS I CAN SET UP A STRUCTURE THAT WILL HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES WHERE THEY WILL HAVE A BETTER SAY, THEY'LL HAVE A BETTER SAY THAN THEY HAVE TODAY. 77 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE RETIRING IN THE NEXT 25 YEARS. THOSE ARE THE BABY BOOMERS. THAT'S TWICE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THE ADULT, THE SENIOR PEOPLE THAT EXIST TODAY. IF THERE'S A GROUP THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THE NATIONAL BALLOT INITIATIVE, IT'S GOING TO BE THE SENIORS BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE MORE CLOUT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY FEEL WILL ADDRESS THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT I WOULD OFFER TO YOU. NOT A MAGIC WAND FROM MIKE GRAVEL AS PRESIDENT, IT'S FROM THE PEOPLE BEING INVOLVED DIRECTLY WITH THE POWER TO MAKE LAWS ON POLICY ISSUE THAT IS AFFECT THEIR LIVES. THAT DOESN'T EXIST TODAY, AND THERE'S NOBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN THAT'S EVEN SUGGESTED THAT. THEY TALK ABOUT BIG CHANGES. THEY'RE COSMETIC CHANGES AND THEY'RE BAND-AIDS. >> COULD I ASK A FOLLOW-UP? I THINK IT'S TO THE PREMISE OF THE QUESTION IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY WHICH IS THAT HAVE YOU FOUND THIS IN YOUR OWN E APPEARANCE AS A PATIENT AND ALSO AS A POLICY MAKE THEY ARE ELDERLY PATIENTS IN PARTICULAR, THE MEDICAL SYSTEM DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME AGGRESSIVENESS AND THE SAME SORT OF CURIOSITY S. THAT SORT OF WHAT YOU WERE GREATING AT HERE IN TOOTERMS OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND THE KIND OF TREATMENT THAT ELDERLY PATIENTS RECEIVE? >> WELL, MAYBE I DIDN'T WANT ANSWER HER PRECISELY. DOCTORS DO A LOT OF TESTING TODAY TO COVER THEIR BACKSIDE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SUED. ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THESE REGIONAL BOARDS IS WE'RE GOING TO DO AWAY WITH WHAT WE SEE THAT THE ATTORNEYS LOVE, AND THAT IS TO GO SUE DOCTORS OR RAISE THE COSTS WHERE THEY CAN'T EVEN STAY IN BUSINESS. THE SAME THING WITH NURSES. THAT'S GOT TO GO. NOW, YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY THE TRIAL LAWYERS ARE POURING INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS? JUST ASK A COUPLE OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING THEIR BLOGGING. LOOK AT THAT DATA, THAT ANSWERS THE WHOLE QUESTION. SO WE CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING. YOU CANNOT HAVE EVERYTHING. AND YO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A BASIC PLAN THAT WILL COVER, AND THE WAY THE PLAN IS DESIGNED, IT WON'T RAISE COSTS BECAUSE THE 30% THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE PAPER COST, IF YOU TOOK THAT AND PUT IT INTO SOME REAL COST IN HEALTH CARE, YOU CAN COVER EVERYBODY WITHOUT RAISING ANY COSTS. BUT YOU DO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT. YOU CAN'T HAVE A BURP AND RUN TO THE DOCTOR. YOU'VE GOT -- WE'VE GOT TO BE RESPONSIBLE AS CITIZENS AND THAT GOES BACK TO THIS WHOLE PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. WE CHANGE THE CULTURE. THAT ITSELF WILL LOWER THE COST. BUT ALSO UNTIL WE ARE TOTALLY IN A NEW CULL ENOUGH THAT REGARD, WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME DISCIPLINE ON WHAT THE BASIC PACKAGE WILL BE, AND THAT IS A DECISION -- AND YOU WANT TO RAISE THE BASIC PACKAGE AND YOU'RE LAW MAKERS? WELL, PUT AN INITIATIVE UP, AND LET'S SAY WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE COST RATHER THAN 7% FOR THE BASIC PACKAGE, WE'RE GOING TO RAISE IT TO 10%. LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. THAT'S THE SLOGAN OF MY CAMPAIGN, LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. WHY SHOULD THE POLITICIANS BE ALSO ON THE -- IN THIS AREA, AND THEY KNOW IT ALL? WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN PRODUCE A DECENT PLAN? I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES THE FOLLOW-ON QUESTION. >> THANK YOU. WE HAVE ABOUT ONE MINUTE LEFT, AND SO I WANT TODAY ASK YOU YOUR SLOGAN LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FROM HERE ON OUT? YOU COME INTO THIS RACE WITHOUT A LOT OF NAME RECOGNITION, WITHOUT A LOT OF MONEY, WITHOUT A BIG ORGANIZATION. WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE? >> WELL, THE PROBLEM OF NOT A LOT OF MONEY CAN BE SOLVED BY THE PEOPLE WHO HEAR MY VOICE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE LOBBYISTS BUNDLING MONEY FOR ME. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GIVERRING THROUGH TOWER EXECUTIVES GIVING ME ANY MONEY. IT'S GOING TO BE IF MY VOICE CAN BE HEARD. AND I DON'T NEED THE $50 BILLION, $100 BILLION OR MILLION DOLLAR THAT IS THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND, ALL I NEED IS A MODICUM OF MONEY, AROUND $10 MILLION, AND I'LL WIN. BECAUSE I'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SAY THE SOLUTION IS WITH YOU, IT'S NOT WHERE THE LEADERS. AND IF I COULD BECOME PRESIDENT, AND LIGHTNING WILL HAVE TO STRIKE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING? LIGHTNING HAS INSTRUCT ALL THE TIME IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. ALL THE TIME. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN POLL POLITICS, AND I COULD BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] I COULD BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. AND IF YOU WORRY ABOUT MY AGE, DON'T. WE CAN GET A YOUNG MAN AS VICE PRESIDENT. OKAY? AND THERE'S A FEW AROUND. >> WELL, THANK YOU. >> I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR. I THINK ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN POLITICS IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO END TODAY'S SESSION. >> THANK YOU FOR",2015-11-07 17:21:45,2007-03-24,Las Vegas,Nevada
http://www.c-span.org/video/?197979-1/huckabee-campaign-event,Huckabee Campaign Event,Mike Huckabee,"MOST OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SPOKE OF THE DAYLONG FORUM ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES LAST WEEKEND IN LAS VEGAS. THE CENTER OF AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND AND THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION CO-HOST THIS EVENT AND INVITED ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. THE REPUBLICANS ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JOE BIDEN DECLINED BECAUSE OF A FAMILY CONFLICT. THAT THE REST OF THE DEMOCRATS OVER THE NEXT TWO HOURS AND 50 MINUTES. >> ELIZABETH EDWARDS WILL BE WITH US THIS MORNING, WHOSE GRACE AND STRENGTH THROUGH OWN HEALTH CARE BATTLE WITH CANCER IS AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL, WE PRAY FOR HER SUCCESS. THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND IS PROUD TO CO-SPONSOR THIS EVENT AT U.N.L.V.. THIS FORUM IS NOT ONLY THE FIRST TO FOCUS COMPLETELY ON OUR NATION'S HEALTH CARE CRISIS, BUT IT IS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL FORUM EVER TO TAKE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY FROM THE BLOGOSPHERE, THINK PROGRESS GOT BORED AND COURTESY OF A WIDE BY REAL NETWORKS. WE HOPE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN LAS VEGAS TODAY WILL ACTUALLY LEAVE LAS VEGAS AND SET THE TONE FOR THE ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. IT IS SIMPLY TIME TO MAKE AFFORDABLE QUALITY COVERAGE FOR EVERY AMERICAN IN REALITY. I DON'T NEED TO TELL NEVADANS THAT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF A FIX DID MORE THAN FOR UNDER 30,000 NEVADANS ALMOST ONE IN FIVE, LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE COSTS THAT HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN HEALTH EXPENDITURES OF ANY STATE OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS. THE SITUATION IN NEVADA HIGHLIGHTS CONCISELY WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OVERALL. IT COST TOO MUCH, IT COVERS TOO FEW, AND IT DELIVERS TOO LITTLE IN TERMS OF HEALTH OF OUR CITIZENS. TODAY, 45 MILLION AMERICANS ARE UNINSURED, INCLUDING 9 MILLION CHILDREN. SINCE 2000, HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS FOR WORKERS HAVE INCREASED FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES. TODAY THE AVERAGE FAMILY INSURANCE POLICY COST $11,840, THAT'S $1,000 MORE THAN A FULL-TIME MINIMUM-WAGE WORKER MAKES IN ONE YEAR. WHAT KIND OF VALUE TO GET FOR ALL THAT MONEY WAS SPENT ON HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES? NOT MUCH. THE U.S. CURRENTLY RANKS 31ST IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY AS 28TH ON INFANT MORTALITY. DO YOU KNOW, I THINK MY GRANDPARENTS WHO CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM A VILLAGE IN GRIESE 100 YEARS AGO WOULD ACTUALLY SHOCKED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT VILLAGE TODAY HAVE A LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN PEOPLE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES. AN HOUR GLOBALIZED ECONOMY, AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND NOT FEARING BETTER. BY 2008 HEALTH CARE COSTS WILL EXCEED PROFITS IN FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TODAY VIOLATES AMERICA'S DEEP COMMITMENT TO HUMAN DIGNITY FOR ALL AND FAIRNESS FOR ALL. AND IT HAMPERS OUR NATION'S ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PRESENTS US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN FIND LEADERS WHO ARE WILLING TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO CAN PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE. WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE SOME CANDIDATES WITH US TODAY WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL TO HAVE AN EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED AND ACCOMPLISHED MODERATOR, KAREN TUMULTY TO LEAD TODAY'S DISCUSSION COULD LET ME INTRODUCE MY GOOD FRIEND AND ALLY, AND EASTERN. ANDY IS AN ORGANIZER, VISIONARY AND A TRUE CHAMPION OF WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TENORS LEADERSHIP AZZI I USE BECOME THE FASTEST-GROWING UNION IN THE NATION, THE LARGEST HEALTH CARE UNION IN THE U.S. AND ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL POLITICAL FORCES IN THE COUNTRY. I PERSONALLY HONORED TO PARTNER WITH HIM WENT ON THE OTHER EFFORTS, SO PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING AND EASTERN. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU JOHN AND CAPS, VICE PRESIDENT FEIN AND U.N.L.V., AND OF COURSE THE SEVEN CANDIDATES, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE 1.8 MILLION MEMBERS OF SE I U WHO MAKE THIS FIRST ISSUE FORM OF THE 2008 ELECTION CYCLE POSSIBLE. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE SECRETARY-TREASURER OF SCI YOU, THE WOMAN WHO IS THE HIGHEST RANKING PERSON IN THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT, THE HEAD OF THE CHANGE TO WIND ORGANIZATION, AND THE BERGER. AND WELCOME ALL MEMBERS OF SE I U, NURSES, PUBLIC WORKERS, JANITORS AND HOME CARE WORKERS WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE CARE -- [APPLAUSE] QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS IS AN ISSUE ON EVERY AMERICAN'S MIND AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE IT IS ON EVERY CANDIDATES AGENDA. THAT MORE IS A NURSE. SHE WORKS AT THE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, WHICH CARES FOR HALF OF THE UNINSURED IN SOUTHERN NEVADA. SHE IS JUST ONE OF 1 MILLION AZZI I YOU HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, WHO TORE OFF ENTREAT THE PEOPLE WHO THE SYSTEM IS FAILING. PAT TALKS OF THE 10-YEAR-OLD CHILD WITH DIABETES, HIS FAMILY TRAVELED TO NEVADA, SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF A GOOD JOB AND A BETTER LIFE. DIABETES IS NORMALLY AN EASILY TREATABLE DISEASE. UNLESS THE REGULAR 40-DOLLAR COST FOR INSULIN TREATMENT. HER FAMILY TRIED TO GET BY BY STRETCHING THE MEDICINE OUT, BUT SADLY FOR THEIR SON, BUT THAT DID NOT WORK. HE WAS RUSHED TO THE ARE IN A COMA. THINK THAT, AFTER THREE DAYS OF INTENSIVE CARE AT THE HOSPITAL HE CAME OUT OF THE COMA AND HE RECOVERED. IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, A 40-DOLLAR BOTTLE OF INSEL PLAN SHOULD NOT BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHILD'S LIFE AND DEATH. HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA IS NO LONGER A MORAL ISSUE, IT'S A MORAL ISSUE IS OKAY AMERICA CANNOT BE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION ON EARTH THAT ASSETS OF EMPLOYERS TO PUT PRICE OF HEALTH CARE ON THE COST OF ITS PRODUCTS WHEN ALL OF ITS COMPETITORS AROUND THE WORLD DO NOT. IT IS NOT JUST A MORAL CRISIS, IT IS AN ECONOMIC CRISIS, AN ECONOMIC PLAN THAT WILL NOT WORK IN A 21ST CENTURY GLOBAL ECONOMY. BUSINESS KNOWS THIS. WHICH IS WHY THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE, A FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES, AT&T, INTEL, CALLIE SERVERS AND WALMART WILL BE JOINED, THEY ARE DEMANDING A NEW HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. THE PUBLIC NOW KNOWS THIS. POLLING IN THE FOUR EARLY PRIMARY STATES SHOWS THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN FOR VOTERS OF BOTH PARTIES. AND A VAST MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICAN VOTERS BELIEVE EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND THEY WANT FUNDAMENTAL, NOT PIECEMEAL CHANGE ANYMORE. GOVERNORS NOW KNOW THIS. GOV SCHWARZENEGGER AND ROMNEY, DEMOCRATS RENDELL AND VOINOVICH HAVE PLANS FOR ALL THEIR CITIZENS AS TO RON WYDEN. POLICY NOW KNOW THIS. GERTZ IS WIDE RANGING AS THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN INSURANCE INDUSTRY PROPOSED PLANS TO CALL FOR COVERAGE FOR ALL AMERICANS. SO WHAT, WHAT ARE WE MISSING? LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON D.C., AND FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT HERE IS THE FINAL PART OF OUR POLL. VOTERS ARE SAYING THEY'RE NOT HEARING FROM YOU ENOUGH ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND IN A MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO START SOLVING THE PROBLEM TOGETHER. THE WINDS OF CHANGE OF HEALTH CARE ARE BLOWING. IT IS UP TO ASK VOTERS, VOTERS TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON. TO ASK QUESTIONS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY LET'S DEMAND DETAILED ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. AMERICA'S FUTURE IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE. IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE. AND EVERY FOUR YEARS OF OUR CHOICES, VOTERS' CHOICES, REALLY DO MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] TO GUIDE US THROUGH OUR DISCUSSION TODAY IS KAREN TUMULTY, ARE MODERATOR PEW ISSUES THE NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT FOR TIME MAGAZINE, WIDELY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST POLITICAL JOURNALIST IN AMERICA. KIRAN HAS WRITTEN OVER 25 COVER STORIES, INCLUDING THIS WEEK'S. SHE WILL MANAGE AS FORUM, TAKE QUESTIONS FROM OUR INTERNET AUDIENCE AND ASK KARON QUESTIONS WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HER HERE TODAY, KAREN TUMULTY. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS REALLY EXCITING TO BE HERE AND ONCE AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR SPENDING YOUR SATURDAY MORNING WITH US. WANT TO THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF U.N.L.V., AS THE I YOU, AND THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND WHICH IS A NON-PROFIT, NON-PARTISAN ORGANIZATION, THE LAWYERS WANTED ME TO SAY THAT PART. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THESE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN COMING MONTHS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND FORUMS LIKE THIS, BUT THIS ONE IS VERY, VERY DIFFERENT. THIS MORNING YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT WHO HAS THAT THE LATEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE OR WITH THE LATEST BACK AND FORTH HIS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THIS MORNING GUESS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRILL DOWN INTO A PARTICULAR ISSUE, AND ONE THAT POLL AFTER POLL AFTER POLL SHOWS HITS HOME IN A WAY NO OTHER ISSUE DOES WITH VOTERS. HOPEFULLY, AT THE END OF THIS MORNING, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THESE CANDIDATES PRIORITIES AS THEY ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SENSE OF WHO HAS A PLAN AND WHO DOES NOT. AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SENSE ALSO OF WHOSE PLAN IS REALISTIC IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE, IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT PRESUMABLY THEY ARE GOING TO CONFRONT AS THEY TAKE OFFICE IN JANUARY OF 2009. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THESE CANDIDATES, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TAKE CARE OF A FEW HOUSEKEEPING ISSUES AND MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AS TO HOW THIS FORUM IS GOING TO WORK. FIRST OF ALL, I SHOULD NOTE THAT ALL THE CANDIDATES OF BOTH PARTIES WERE INVITED TO THIS FORUM. THESE SEVEN, ALL DEMOCRATS, ARE THE ONES WHO ACCEPTED. THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WILL BE SPEAKING THIS MORNING IS THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION. THE FORMAT IS GOING TO GO LIKE THIS: EACH CANDIDATE IS GOING TO HAVE 20 MINUTES. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO, THREE MINUTES TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT AND WE WILL SEE HOW WELL WE CAN HOLD POLITICIANS TO THAT. AND THEN OF THE REMAINING MINUTES, THE REMAINING 17 TO 18 MINUTES WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG QUESTIONS FROM MYSELF, QUESTIONS FROM THIS AUDIENCE AND QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE COMING IN OVER THE INTERNET BY E-MAIL BECAUSE THIS IS OF COURSE BEING WEBCAST, NOW WE'RE LIVING IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IF ANY OF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU NEED OR WANT TO LEAVE THE ROOM DURING ANYONE'S PRESENTATION, HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE BY YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO COME BACK UNTIL THE BREAK BEFORE THE NEXT CANDIDATE. AND I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE'RE READY TO START, SO OUR FIRST CANDIDATE, WHO I BELIEVE IS NOW IN THE BUILDING, IS THE FORMER SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA, JOHN EDWARDS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE. LET ME SAY FIRST A PERSONAL THANK-YOU TO ALL OF YOU AND TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SO KIND AND SO GENEROUS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, INCLUDING BY THE WAY, MY FELLOW CANDIDATES WHO WILL BE HERE TODAY. I'M VERY PROUD TO HAVE MY WIFE, ELISABETH, HERE WITH ME TODAY. [APPLAUSE] >> AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK KATHY AND THE SE I U FOR SPONSORING THIS FORM AND FOR TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US, TO ALL AMERICANS. WHAT WE HAVE IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WHAT WE NEED IS BIG, BOLD DRAMATIC CHANGE, NOT SMALL CHANGE. WE NEED TO NOT JUST FIX OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM, WE NEED TO FIX OUR MILITARY AND VETERANS' HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WHICH DESPERATELY NEEDS WORK, AS WE ALL ALL SEEN RECENTLY. LET ME TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT MY PLAN FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND THEN I AM SURE WE WILL GET INTO MORE DETAIL AS WE GO THROUGH THIS CONVERSATION. BASICALLY, WHAT WE DO IS COVER ALL AMERICANS. AND MY PLAN, THERE ARE SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES, THE EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER THEIR EMPLOYEES OR TO PAY INTO A FUND THAT WILL HELP PAY FOR COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. THE GOVERNMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL SET UP HEALTH-CARE MARKETS ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND IN EACH OF THOSE MARKETS, IF YOU ARE THE CONSUMER, YOU CAN GO IN AND CHOOSE WHAT YOUR HEALTH CARE PLAN WILL BE CARRIED SOME OF THE CHOICES ARE PRIVATE INSURERS AND THEN WHEN CHOICE IS A GOVERNMENT PLAN, BASICALLY A MEDICARE PLUS PLANS. THE IDEA IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AMERICANS ACTUALLY WATCHED A PRIVATE ENSURE OR WHETHER THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE GOVERNMENT RUN MEDICARE PLUS KIND OF SINGLE PAYER PLAN. AND WE WILL FIND OUT OVER TIME WHICH WHICH PEOPLE GO. THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN ALSO COVERS THE CRACKS THAT EXIST IN OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. THERE'S COMPLETE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY, COVERAGE FOR CHRONIC CARE, COVERAGE FOR PREVENTIVE CARE, COVERAGE FOR LONG-TERM CARE. WE SUBSIDIZE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. THAT CATS OUT AT ABOUT $80,000 OF INCOME A YEAR. THERE ARE HUGE COST CONTAINMENT PIECES IN THIS HEALTHCARE PLAN. THE REQUIREMENT OF PREVENTIVE CARE. WE REQUIRE BY COMPETITION, LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, SPENDING 30 TO 40 CENTS ON EACH HEALTH-CARE DOLLAR TODAY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE'RE GOING TO BRING US DOWN, BRING THEM DOWN DRAMATICALLY. WE REQUIRE AND DEMAND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY, THE USE OF ELECTRONIC RECORD-KEEPING, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND HELP BRING DOWN HEALTH-CARE COSTS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO MEASURE WHAT IS WORKING, WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT, HOW WE GET THE MOST EFFECTIVE DRUGS IN THE MOST COSTLY DRUGS. THE IDEA IS, COVER EVERYBODY, BRING DOWN HEALTH-CARE COSTS FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, WHICH THIS PLAN I BELIEVE WILL DO. FILL IN THE CRACKS IN OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. INSEL'S RESPONSIBLE PARTY BESIDES THE EMPLOYERS IN THE GOVERNMENT OR INDIVIDUALS. EVERYONE IN AMERICA WILL BE REQUIRED TO, BY LAW, TO BE COVERED BY THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN THE LASTING WILL TELL YOU IS THE COST IS 90 TO $120 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S COSTS. I PAY FOR IT BY ROLLING BACK GEORGE BUSH'S TAX CUTS FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE OVER CHANDRA THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SENATOR AND ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WEEK THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE HAD, WE STILL PERCEIVE BEING HERE AND OF COURSE EVERYONE'S BEST WISHES AND PRAYERS GO TO YOUR FAMILY AND OF COURSE TO MRS. EDWARDS. [APPLAUSE] OF ALL THE CANDIDATES THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM TODAY, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A DETAILED, SPECIFIC PLAN AS TO HOW YOU ARE GOING TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND YOU HAVE BEEN CANDID ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IT INVOLVES TAX INCREASES. BUT ONE OF THE REASONS YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT BEING SPECIFIC ON HEALTH CARE -- IF YOU ARE MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN YOU RAN IN 2004, IS THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH WITH MRS. EDWARDS ILLNESS. SO, AS YOU HAD A BIG DECISION TO MAKE THIS WEEK, HE MADE IT VERY QUICKLY. BUT AS PEOPLE LOOK AT THE SITUATION YOU ARE AND, THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE IN, THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO TO TO ALL CONSUMING THINGS HERE AT ONCE, AND THAT HOWEVER POSITIVE THE COURSE OF THIS TREATMENT TURNS OUT TO BE, THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PERSONAL UPS AND DOWNS FOR YOU OVER THE NEXT YEAR-AND-A-HALF. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE BOTH OF THOSE AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT SUPPORTING IT, ARE THINKING ABOUT CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR CAMPAIGN THAT ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF TO ALL CONSUMING THINGS AT ONE TIME? WILL YOU BE IN THIS RACE FOR THE DURATION? >> I AM DEFINITELY IN THE RACE FOR THE DURATION. WHAT SHOWS FROM OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CHALLENGE LIKE THIS THAT ELIZABETH AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. AS MANY OF DO YOU KNOW, WE LOST A SON ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO NOW. WE'VE GONE THROUGH AT ELIZABETH'S FIRST ROUND OF BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. WE WENT THROUGH THAT TOGETHER. SO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO FUNCTION IN A VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT. THERE IS A FOCUS AND IMMATURITY THAT I THINK IS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT I KNOW, BECAUSE I'VE DONE IT IN THE PAST, THAT WE CAN DO IT. I KNOW BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WOMAN I AM MARRIED TO, THE ISSUE WILL BE EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY MAKING SURE WE DO IT. AND WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVING HIS COUNTRY VERY SERIOUSLY. IT IS THE REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. AT THINK WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE'RE DOING NOW. AND WE WANT TO SERVE, BOTH OF US, WHICH IS WHY WE MADE THE DECISION TO GO FORWARD. BUT I WANT TO ADD ONE THING BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE TWO OF US. I THINK WE'RE GETTING FAR TOO MUCH CREDIT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF WOMEN, WHO HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH THE SAME SORT OF STRUGGLES THAT ELIZABETH HAS HAD, AND MANY OF THEM HAVE HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH IT WITHOUT WHAT WE HAVE, WITHOUT GREAT HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE, WITHOUT KNOWING THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL THE MEDICINE AND MEDICATIONS THAT THEY NEED. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY WOMAN AND EVERY PERSON IN AMERICA GETS THE SAME KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A WOMAN HAS TO GO THROUGH, OR ANYBODY, HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS KIND OF STRUGGLE AND HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD THE MEDICINE THEY NEED, WHETHER THEY CAN GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. AND NO AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. AS ELIZABETH SAID A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, FOR US, WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR OUR FAMILY AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT A LOT OF WOMEN WITH EXACTLY THE SAME DIAGNOSIS HAD TO GIVE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND GO TO WORK. AND THE NEXT MORNING AND GO TO WORK. SO, BEFORE WE START GETTING TOO MUCH CREDIT TO US LET'S DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR ALL WOMEN. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SENATOR. ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF YOUR PLAN HAS BEEN THAT IT IS NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH IN DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS. HE TALKED ABOUT SAVING MONEY THROUGH PREVENTIVE CARE, THROUGH USING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE THERE REALLY IS NOT BEING USED A LOT IN THE HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY. BUT RIGHT NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR AUDIENCE, JACK MARCO, WHO IS THE HONOR OF A SMALL BUSINESS, WHO WANTS TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE GOING TO -- HOW YOU ARE GOING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE KIND OF RISING HEALTH-CARE COSTS THAT HE HAS TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY AND THAT THREATEN HIS BUSINESS. JACK, ARE YOU HERE? >> I AM ALLOWED, BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED. I HAVE A BUSINESS. WE JUST COMPLETED OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS WE HAVE PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEM. EVERY YEAR BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT. BECAUSE IN THIS PROCESS, WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO TALKING ABOUT WAGES, WE HAD TO OFFER LAST AND THE EMPLOYEES HAD TO ACCEPT LESS THAN THEY WOULD LIKE OR WE'D LIKE TO GET BECAUSE OF THE MONEY WE HAD TO PAY AND HEALTH CARE. AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE TO COMPETE IN AN INDUSTRY WITH PEOPLE DOING THE SAME KIND OF BUSINESS IDEA. THE COST I HAVE FOR MY 75 EMPLOYES CONFIRM -- MEANS I HAVE TO CHARGE HIGHER FEES FOR THE SERVICES I PROVIDE AND LIKEWISE I HAVE TO PROVIDE -- I CAN ONLY PROVIDE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF WAGES THAT PERHAPS COMPETITOR COULD PROVIDE MORE. MY QUESTION IS AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO TO TAKING CARE OF THIS COMPETITIVE PROBLEM. >> CITY OF 75 EMPLOYES? >> RIGHT. >> I THINK THIS PLAN DEALS DIRECTLY WITH THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE. WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE THIS ISSUE, NOT ONLY BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR COMPETITORS HERE IN AMERICA WE HAVE A HUGE COMPETITIVE IN THIS ISSUE BETWEEN OUR BUSINESSES IN AMERICA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH CARE COSTS, WHICH ARE DEALING WITH EVERY SINGLE YEAR IN THE OPERATION OF YOUR BUSINESS. THOSE COSTS HAVE TO COME DOWN. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, WHAT WE WANT PHYSICALLY HAVE A TRULY UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT COVERS EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN FROM THE TIME THEY'RE BORN UNTIL THE TIME THEY DIE, IT MAKES AMERICAN BUSINESS MORE COMPETITIVE IN THE WORLD. WE'RE SPENDING 17 TO $1,800 EVERY -- COMPARED TO $250 JAPAN COULD AGREE TO A HUGE DISADVANTAGE. WHAT THIS PLAN SPECIFICALLY DOES FOR YOUR SITUATION IS, IT GIVES YOU MARKET POWER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TODAY. INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE NO MARKET POWER AND AS A RESULT YOU PAY EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH CARE COSTS. SO WHAT WE DO WHEN HE SAID THAT THESE HEALTH CARE MARKETS IS WE CREATE THE SAME MARKET POWER FOR YOU THAT EXISTS FOR THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. THESE MARKETS WILL REQUIRE COMPETITIVE BIDDING TO GET INTO THE MARKETS AND THEY'RE ALL SO THESE PRIVATE INSURERS THAT WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH A GOVERNMENT PLAN, WITH EXTRAORDINARY LOW ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, TO TWO MAKAR% IN ALL LIKELIHOOD. THAT COMPETITION WILL BRING DOWN COSTS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THESE THINGS KAREN MADE MENTION OF, USE A TECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONIC RECORD-KEEPING, PREVENTIVE CARE, MANDATORY PREVENTATIVE CARE SO THAT WERE HEALTHY -- HEALTHCARE AND WE ARE A WELL PEOPLE. WILL BRING DOWN POLICY FOR EVERYBODY. I THINK SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE FOR YOU IS, WE WILL BRING DOWN HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS ON HOLD FOR WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO PAY. SECOND, YOUR COST DIRECTLY WILL BE LOWER BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A LEVEL OF COMPETITION THAT DOES NOT EXIST TODAY AND YOU'LL HAVE A MARKET POWER THAT IS NOT EXIST TODAY. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT, BESIDES THE UNINSURED, WHO I THINK WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO, BESIDES THE UNINSURED THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN ARE INDIVIDUALS AND SMALLER BUSINESSES. I THINK YOU ARE THE GREATEST BENEFICIARY OF THIS PLAN. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, THE HEALTH-CARE PROBLEM HAS BEEN WITH US VERY A VERY LONG TIME. THE LAST TIME A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ADDRESS IT, IT NEVER EVEN GOT TO A VOTE ON THE FLOOR IN EITHER HOUSE OF CONGRESS BECAUSE OF SOME MONEY FRONTS OF OPPOSITION. OF THOSE, THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK AND THE STRONGEST WAS BUSINESS. SO WE HAVE A QUESTION COMING IN OVER E-MAIL FROM MARY ANN ELEANORA, WHO WANTS TO KNOW, DO YOU HAVE A STRATEGY FOR ENGAGING AMERICAN BUSINESSES IN ACHIEVING HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE FOR ALL AMERICANS? >> YES, BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE AMERICAN BUSINESS COMPETITIVE, BRING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE NOT IS FOR INDIVIDUALS, WHICH WE DO, BUT ALSO FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS. SO THIS PLAN DOES ALL THOSE THINGS. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF A SMALL BUSINESS BUT IT ACTUALLY APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESSES. WHAT HAPPENS IS, BECAUSE THEIR HUGE COST CONTAINMENT ELEMENTS IN THIS PLAN WHICH WILL NOT GO THROUGH AGAIN, AND BECAUSE WE'RE SUBSIDIZING HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES, THIS IS THE EFFECT OF BRINGING DOWN HEALTH-CARE COSTS FOR ALL BUSINESSES. TSE I YOU HAD AND IN EASTERN HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE A FEW WEEKS AGO WITH SOME VERY LARGE AMERICAN BUSINESSES, WHO WERE COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING. AND I BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY AMERICAN BUSINESSES NOW HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, THAT IT IS MAKING THEM INCREASINGLY UNCOMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. AND UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, THEN THE RIGHT WAY, WITH THE RIGHT CHOICES AND THE RIGHT EFFICIENCIES, WILL ACTUALLY HELP AMERICAN BUSINESS, NOT JUST HELP THE 47 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. >> WELL THEY'RE GOING TO BE CANDIDATES TO COME OUT HERE TODAY, WHO SUGGEST IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS, TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WITHOUT RAISING TAXES. WITHOUT NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE. YOU HAVE BEEN VERY UP-FRONT ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE NORPLANT DOES INVOLVE TAX INCREASES. IF YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET THERE WITHOUT THEM? >> NO, I DO NOT HIT WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WORKING WITH ECONOMISTS AROUND THE WORLD. I'VE SPENT MANY MONTHS ON THIS. IT PLANNED THIS -- MY PLAN CAN ADD A FEW WEEKS AGO. I'VE SPENT A GREAT AND DEAL OF TIME WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU COULD HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE WITHOUT FINDING A SOURCE OF REVENUE. THERE HAS TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF REVENUE. WE DON'T GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR FREE. YOU HAVE TO COVER 47 MILLION PEOPLE, THE DON'T HAVE COVERAGE. THERE'S ONE TO THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION FROM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY TO A TRULY UNIVERSAL AND MORE EFFICIENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO NO, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT FINDING AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF REVENUE AND THE JOKE I ALWAYS MAKE ABOUT IT IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HEARD SO MANY POLITICIANS FOR SO LONG SAY, ALL WERE RIGHT TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, TRANSFORM THE WAY WE USE ENERGY IN AMERICA, AND POVERTY IN AMERICA AND IN THE PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT. THEY'VE PROBABLY GOT A BRIDGE IN BROOKLYN THAT WANT TO SELL YOU TOO. I JUST DON'T THINK IT CAN BE DONE AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT, LIKE I SAY ONE LAST THING ABOUT THIS, I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE NINE STATES BE HONEST WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE OPEN AND HONEST. [APPLAUSE] AND I ALSO THINK THAT HONESTY STARTS RIGHT HERE IN THE CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] >> AS YOU WERE PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR HEALTH CARE PLAN, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF BASING YOUR HEALTH COVERAGE ON WHERE YOU WORK IS JUST AN ANACHRONISM. IS A HISTORICAL ACCIDENT. YOU, HOWEVER, CHOSE TO BUILD ON THAT SYSTEM. WHY IS IT THAT YOU DID NOT COME AS SOME PEOPLE SUGGESTED, WHY DO REJECT THE IDEA OF A GOVERNMENT-RUN MEDICARE FOR EVERYBODY, OR SOME OTHER FORM OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD, AGAIN, GET RID OF A SYSTEM THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A HISTORICAL ACCIDENT? .. I THINK WE CAN GET SUPPORT ACROSS THE POLITICAL SBEK TRUMP AND WE'LL ACCOMPLISH A LOT OF WHAT HE WANT TO DO. SECOND, IT DOES GIVE PEOPLE CHOICE AND I THINK AMERICANS HAVE BECOME AWE CUSTOM TO HAVING CHOICE AND I THINK THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT THEIR HEALTHCARE PLAN IS. NOW, IT MATE BE THAT THIS GRAVITATES TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYOR PLAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE MEDICARE SINGLE PLUS CHOICE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THE WHOLE SYSTEM COULD GO IN THAT DIRECTION. YOU'LL DID HE SIDE THAT. CONSUMERS WILL DECIDE THAT. I THINK ACTUALLY THIS IS -- THIS PLAN MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF MOVING US FORWARD, GETTING OUR UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE PLAN IN PLACE, GIVING PEOPLE THE CHOICE OF THE EQUIVALENT OF A SINGLE PAYOR PLAN WITH MEDICARE PLUS. THEN WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE. >> I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION FROM THE AUDIENCE AND THIS IS A SUBJECT VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO SCU MEMBERS. AN RN FROM DESERT SPRING HOSPITAL. HAVE YOU HERE? >> HI REGGIE WARNER, A NURSE AT UCS DESERT SPRINGS HOSPITAL. I SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO PATIENTS EVERY DAY IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF SHORT STAFFING, AND I ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO NURSES WHO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF JOB BURNOUT AND OVERALL DISSATISFACTION. WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING FOR SAFE STAFFING AND NURSE RETENTION. >> WELL, WE HAVE A HUGE NURSING CRISES IN AMERICA WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW ABOUT FIRST HAND. I THINK A PART OF THAT CRISES IS DEALT WITH BY ACHIEVING A TRULY UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, WHERE EVERYONE GETS REIMBURSED AT A FAIR RATE FOR THE SERVICES THEY'RE PROVIDING AND IN THE CONTEST OF ACHIEVING THIS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WE CAN REGULATE IT IN A WAY THAT STAFFING BE ADEQUATE. YOU KNOW, NURSES ARE WORKING EXTRAORDINARY -- NURSES WHO WERE THE PRIMARY CARE GIVERS CERTAINLY IN A HOSPITAL SETTING, THEY SPEND A LOT MORE TIME WITH THE PATIENT THAN PHYSICIANS DO. IN MANY CASES, THEY'RE STRESSED, THEY'RE WORKING LONG HOURS AND THEY'RE TERRIFIED, AS YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I HEAR EVERY TIME I TALK TO A NURPS, THEY'VE AFRAID THAT THE RESULTS OF ALL THIS IS THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A MISTAKE. AND THE PATIENT'S GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO SUFFERS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO, IN ADDITION TO HAVING A TRULY UNIVERSAL SYSTEM, IN ADDITION TO REGULATING IN A WAY TO KEEP STAFFING WHICH IS EASIER TO ESTABLISH IN A UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE AS A NATION NEED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO BEEF UP OUR AVAILABILITY OF NURSES, WHICH MEANS MORE INVESTMENT, MORE SCHOLARSHIP IN NURSING SCHOOLS. IT MEAN INDIVIDUALING AN INCENTIVE TO GET NURSES WHO ARE GRADUATING TO PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED THE MOST, WHERE NURSING SHORTAGE IS MOST SEVERE. IN OTHER WORDS INCENTIVE PAY, SO HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP ATTRACT NURSES TO GO TO THE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED THE MOST. AND THEN CREATE A WORKING ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS NURSES TO BE THE PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY WANT TO BE. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT'S OUR TIME, SENATOR EDWARDS. AND AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND BEST WISHES GOING TOWARD. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR JOHN EDWARDS WITH HIS 340E7B8, WALKING OFF THE STAGE MEETING HIS WIFE AND WALKING OUT OF THE AUDITORIUM. >> THIS IS A NEIGHBOR, HE'S GOVERNOR BILL RICHARDSON OF NEW MEXICO. [APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO THANK SCIU AND THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS FOR PUTTING THIS EVENT TOGETHER. MY FIRST THOUGHTS AND BARBARA, MY WIFE'S FIRST THOUGHTS TODAY ARE FOR ELIZABETH EDWARDS AND THE EDWARDS FAMILY IN THIS VERY TRYING TIMES. [APPLAUSE] IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE, IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE ABOUT A POLICY MESSAGE RELATING TO THIS SITUATION IS THAT AS AMERICANS, WE SHOULD SPEND MORE AND INVEST MORE IN CANCER RESEARCH, IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND MANY OF OUR ENTITIES THAT ARE UNDER FUNDED AND WITH FLAT BUDGETS. WE SHOULD INVEST MORE IN STEM CELL RESEARCH. WE SHOULD FIND WAYS TO INVEST IN THE DISEASES IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WE AS AMERICANS ARE IN CRISES TODAY. AS A GOVERNOR, I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTHCARE CRISES EVERY DAY. WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH INCREASING ACCESS COVERAGE AND CONTROLLING COSTS. SINCE THE YEAR 2000, HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES BY 80%. 4,000 AMERICANS LOSE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE EVERY DAY. WE SPENT $2 TRILLION ON HEALTHCARE. 31% OF HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE SPENT ON BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE INSTEAD OF DIRECT HERE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DEVISE A STRATEGY -- FIRST OF ALL, THAT DOESN'T CREATE ANY MORE BUREAUCRACIES. WE HAVE ENOUGH BUREAUCRACIES. AS A GOVERNOR, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL COSTS. I'VE EVEN CUT TAXES FOR WORKING FAMILIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, EXPANDED COVERAGE. SO WHAT WOULD I DO AS A PRESIDENT? FIRST, TO DEAL WITH INCREASING COVERAGE. NUMBER ONE. ALL AMERICANS AND ALL BUSINESSES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME COVERAGE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO DO THAT AND WE CAN DO THAT. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD START SOMETHING NEW. AMERICANS 55 AND OLDER SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICARE. TODAY IT'S AT 65. [APPLAUSE] NUMBER THREE, A TRADE, AND THIS IS HOW A GOVERNOR WOULD OPERATE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, MEDICARE GOES TO TREAT SENIORS AND THE DISABLED, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE STATE DEALING AN INCREASING MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND NUMBER FOUR, VETERANS. WE SHOULD GIVE OUR MILITARY VETERANS THE ACCESS THEY NEED ANYWHERE THEY WANT, ANY TIME THEY WANT. [APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD HAVE A HERO'S HEALTH CARD THAT WOULD ENABLE OUR VETERANS WHEN THEY GET OUT, TO GET COVERAGE, CHOICES ANYWHERE THEY WANT. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DRIVE 200 MILES TO THE NEAREST VA HOSPITAL. NOW, THIS IS HOW I WOULD DEAL WITH COVERAGE. WHAT ABOUT COSTS? I WOULD HAVE A COOPERATIVE PLAN BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER, BUSINESSES, THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WOULD PROPOSE A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE AMERICANS THAT NEED COVERAGE BASED ON INCOME. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD CLAMP DOWN ON CREDIT CARD COMPANIES THAT ARE COVERING EXCESSIVE INTEREST RATER COSTS. -- INTEREST RATE COSTS. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE A SECRETARY WHOSE BROTHER IS PAYING 18%. THAT'S FOR HEALTHCARE ON CREDIT CARDS. 18% INTEREST RATE. I WOULD PUT A CAP ON THOSE COSTS. I WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PREVENTION STRATEGY. EARLY PREVENTION, KIDS. AS GOVERNOR, I ELIMINATED JUNK FOOD IN SCHOOLS. [APPLAUSE] I JUST SIGNED A STATE-WIDE SMOKING BAN AND I WOULD THAT AS PRESIDENT. I WOULD HAVE A PROMOTION OF HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE, IMPACT CREDIT TO COMPANIES THAT ENCOURAGE THEIR WORKERS TO BE HEALTHIER, TO EXERCISE. I WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH 31% OF EXCESSIVE HEALTHCARE COSTS AND BUREAUCRACY BY ELECTRONIC RECORDS. I WOULD ALSO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER -- HOW DO WE PAY FOR THIS? THIS IS HOW I WOULD PAY FOR THIS HEALTHCARE PLAN. NUMBER ONE, WE REORDER PRIORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. WE GET OUT OF IRAQ AND PUT THE $400 BILLION WE HAVE IN IRAQ AND SHIFT IT TO HUMAN NEEDS. [APPLAUSE] NUMBER TWO, WE SPENT TWO TRILLION ON HEALTHCARE. WE SHIFT AND REORDER PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF REDUCING INEFFICIENCIES IN OUR SYSTEM. AND NUMBER THREE, WE WOULD OFFER OPTIONS FOR ALL AMERICANS TO GET HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, WORKERS MUST GET HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. BUT YOU HELP THEM IF THEY NEED IT. AND BUSINESSES, AND SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN HEALTHCARE PLANS FOR ALL THOSE EMPLOYEES. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. THIS IS A PLAN THAT WOULD NOT ADD BUREAUCRACY. THIS IS A PLAN THAT COULD BE PAID FOR WITHOUT ANY NEW TAXES. THIS IS A PLAN I BELIEVE THAT SAYS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IF I HAVE A HEALTHCARE PLAN AND I'M SATISFIED WITH IT, I CAN KEEP IT THE WAY IT IS. I BELIEVE ALSO THAT AS AMERICANS, WE HAVE TO ENSURE PREVENTION. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. MAKING SURE THAT WE START EARLY, MAKING SURE THAT WE PROMOTE HEALTHIER LIFE-STYLES. THAT WOULD BE MY PLAN AS PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] >> GOVERNOR, I'M AFRAID IF YOU'RE ATTACKING JUNK FOOD, YOU'RE ALREADY LOST MY TEN-YEAR-OLD'S VOTE. [LAUGHTER] HOW QUICKLY UNDER YOUR PLAN DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET TO TRUE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE? >> I BELIEVE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, A STRONGER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, I BELIEVE THIS PLAN THAT I OUTLINE WHICH IS BASICALLY A PLAN THAT IS TAKING NEW IDEAS INTO AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK COULD BE ACHIEVED MY FIRST YEAR AS PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE IT'S DOABLE. I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A SHIFT IN-LAWS. FOR INSTANCE, TRADING, THE FEDERAL ROLE IN MEDICARE, THE STATE ROLE IN MEDICAID FOR S CHIP IN CHILDREN. I BELIEVE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOO IS WITHIN THE COST STRUCTURE. WHEN YOU'RE SPENDING TWO TRILLION ON HEALTHCARE, REMEMBER THERE ARE 47 MILLION UNINSURED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WHEN WE'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR IT. IT'S ALREADY BEING PAID FOR. THEY'RE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR THIS. SO IT'S A QUESTION OF SHIFTING PRIORITIES. SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS, I BELIEVE, A VERY AGGRESSIVE PLAN, WITH NEW IDEAS THAT COULD YOU BE ACHIEVED THE FIRST YEAR THAT I'M PRESIDENT. >> AS WASHINGTON HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, YOU AND YOUR FELLOW GOVERNORS HAS MOVED FORWARD AND STEPPED INTO THE BREACH. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSY ASPECTS OF THE PLAN THAT GOVERNOR SCHWARZNEGGER JUST RECENTLY UNVEILED IN CALIFORNIA IS HIS PROPOSAL THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BE COVERED UNDER HIS PLAN. HOW WOULD YOU SEE UNDER YOUR PLAN BRINGING THIS VERY VERY LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION INTO THE SYSTEM OR NOT. >> THEY'RE CHILDREN. WE SHOULD COVER CHILDREN. WE SHOULD COVER CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] AS LONG AS THEY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF MY PLAN IS THAT WE ALL PAY, EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES, THE GOVERNMENT. BUT WE HELP EACH OTHER PAY THE FAIR SHARE. THE WAY YOU DEAL WITH IMMIGRATION, ONE, YES, WE HAVE TO SECURE OUR BORDERS, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. NOT WITH THIS STUPID WALL THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED. [APPLAUSE] BUT YOU ALSO SET UP, YOU ALSO SET UP A LEGALIZATION PLAN FOR THE 12 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS THAT ARE IN THIS COUNTRY. MAYBE IT'S NOT VERY POPULAR, BUT IT MAKES SENSE BASED ON SETTING A PATH OF LEGALIZATION THAT INVOLVES DEALING WITH ISSUES LIKE HEALTHCARE THAT INVOLVE, IF THEY LEARN ENGLISH, IF THEY PAY BACK TAXES, IF THEY PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, THEY DON'T GET AHEAD OF THE LINE OF THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET HERE LEGAL. THESE ARE CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD INSURE ALL CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY. >> WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM DAVID SLATER IN OUR AUDIENCE WHO HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT THE KIND OF HEALTHCARE THAT CONGRESS GETS AND WARRANTS TO KNOW WHY HE CAN'T HAVE IT TOO. [LAUGHTER] . [APPLAUSE] >> THE GOVERNOR BROUGHT UP EXACTLY MY QUESTION. EXACTLY MY QUESTION TO CONGRESS, SENATORS, STAFF, POSTAL WORKERS ARE IN GREAT PLAN SPONSORED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WAS IN THAT PLAN, I'M A RETIRED POSTAL WORKER. IT'S A FABULOUS PLAN, WHY REINVENT THE WHEEL. WE HAVE AN EXISTING SYSTEM THAT CAN FUNCTION. WE DON'T NEED BUREAUCRACY AS YOU MENTION, JUST IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN TO EVERYBODY HERE IN THIS ROOM. EVERYBODY THAT'S A U.S. CITIZEN TO HAVE THE SAME PLAN AS SENATOR EDWARDS SAID, HE'S COMFORTABLE. EVERY FEDERAL WORK HE WERE IS VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR PLAN. EVERY POSTAL WORKER HAS THAT PLAN. THEY HAVE AN OPTION TO PICK FROM ANY INSURANCE COMPANY THEY WANT. WHY NOT JUST GIVE IT TO THE UNITED STATES CITIZENS RIGHT NOW AND THE GOVERNOR SAYS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN ONE YEAR. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT'S THE CORNERSTONE OF MY PLAN THAT DEALS WITH COVERAGE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT, THEY GET THE BEST PLAN IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF OPTIONS. WHAT I'M SAYING IS OFFER THAT TO EVERY AMERICAN TO EVERY BUSINESS, TO EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY IN THAT FEDERAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. AN EXCELLENT QUESTION, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> WE ALSO HAVE A QUESTION BY E-MAIL FROM KEN IN OLYMPIA WASHINGTON WHO WANTS TO KNOW HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO HAS PREPARED YOU TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. IF I COULD JUST ADD ON TO THAT, COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU LEARNED -- WHAT PARTS OF THE PROBLEM, THE HEALTHCARE PROBLEM IN DEALING WITH IT IN NEW MEXICO TURNED OUT TO BE HARDER TO CONFRONT THAN YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE. >> AS A CEO OF A STATE, GOVERNORS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE EVERY DAY. AND THE MOST I BELIEVE INNOVATIVE EXPERIMENTS ARE HAPPENING TO COVER ALL OUR PEOPLE AND ALSO CONTROL COSTS. AS A GOVERNOR, MY APPROACH HAS BEEN -- AND MY STATE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST UNINSURED. IT'S ABOUT 20-21%. 10% OF THOSE ARE NATIVE AMERICANS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE COVERED BY A FEDERAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, AND THEY'RE NOT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABDICATING SO WE TRY TO HIM WITH STATE RUN PROGRAMS. WE TRY TO DO WHAT WE DO IN THE STATES. I STARTED OUT WITH A HEALTHCARE PLAN DEALING WITH THIS AHCCCS ISSUE. NUMBER ONE, WE WERE ABLE TO INSURE ALL CHILDREN UNDER FIVE. NOW WE'RE TRYING TO COVER ALL WORKING ADULTS. THE NEXT PHASE WILL BE WE WILL TRY TO COVER THE CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED. BUT WE HAVE ATTACKED THE PREVENTION ISSUE AGGRESSIVELY AS I MENTIONED. WE CUT JUNK FOOD OUT OF SCHOOLS. I SIGNED RECENTLY LAST WEEK A STATE-WIDE SMOKING BAN. WE SHOULD NATIONALLY GIVE INCENTIVES TO COMPANIES THAT GIVE THEIR HEALTHCARE WORKERS TIME TO EXERCISE OR AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A HEALTHIER LIFE-STYLE. WE SHOULD FIND WAYS ALSO THAT IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM, WE ENCOURAGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO START EARLIER. EARLY CHILDHOOD, PRESCHOOL. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTERS AT ALL OUR SCHOOLS. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE RESEARCH. IT'S GOING TO TAKE EFFORTS, AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH MALARIA, TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT RELATE TO SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR CHILDREN. TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT RELATE ALSO FOR CHILDREN THAT HAVE SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. IN PREVENTION, WE SPEND 75% OF HEALTHCARE COSTS ON CHRONIC DISEASES AND ONLY 5% ON PREVENTION. THAT SHOULD SHIFT. [APPLAUSE]. >> WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM A MEMBER IN THE OFFICE TRACY POWELL WHO WORKS FOR THE FAMILY SERVICES IN CLARK COUNTY AND IS REALLY ON THE FRONT LINES EVERY DAY OF SEEING ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE HEALTHCARE CRISES. >> GOOD MORNING. I AM A SOCIAL WORKER FOR CLARK COUNTY DEPARTMENT FAMILY SERVICES AND I'M A MEMBER OF SEIU. WE HAVE HOW HEALTH SERVICES AND ABUSE ISSUES IMPACT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. TYPICALLY THESE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH. HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CARE PROVIDED AND COVERAGE PROVIDED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES? [APPLAUSE] >> WELL, FOR YEARS, MENTAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN GIVEN LOWER PRIORITY IN HEALTHCARE THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER PROBLEM. ONE OUT OF FIVE AMERICANS HAVE HEALTH PROBLEM INCLUDING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND DEPRESSION. IN TERMS OF INSURANCE AND COVERAGE WE'VE KNOW GLIK THE MENTAL HEALTH. AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD NOT DO THAT. WHAT WE DO IN NEW MEXICO IS WE BROUGHT ALL MENTAL HEALTH BUREAUCRACY PROGRAMS UNDER ONE ROOF INTO WHAT IS CALLED THE MENTAL HEALTH ELABORATIVE. WE NEED TO FIND WAYS ALSO THAT WE DEAL WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. YOU MENTIONED IN NEW MEXICO IN THE WEST, IN NEVADA RIGHT HERE, METH IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN BEST TREAT IT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE, MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, ALCOHOLISM, WHAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INCARCERATION BUT TREATMENT AND EDUCATION. AN INVESTMENT IN SERIOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS THAT CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> GOVERNOR, DOES THAT SURGEON THAT YOU SUPPORT FULL PARITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE. YOUR SENIOR SENATOR OF YOUR STATE, PETE HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON THAT VERY SUBJECT. OPPONENTS SAY LOOK, THIS IS GOING TO -- TALK ABOUT RISING COSTS BUT COSTS WOULD JUST EXPLODE IF IN FACT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE COVERED THE SAME WAY AS PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES. >> I WOULD INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, YES, I WOULD. BUT SEE, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT COSTS. WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF WE MANAGE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENTLY, ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE DUPLICATION. JUST THINK, 31% OF OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS IS BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE, AND IT'S NOT DIRECT CARE. IF WE FIND WAYS TO MAKE THAT MORE EFFICIENT WITH PERHAPS ELECTRONIC RECORDS, WITH, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE 50 STATES MANAGING 50 MEDICAID PROGRAMS. YOU'VE GOT A MEDICARE SYSTEM THAT HAS HUNDREDS OF HEALTHCARE PLANS ADMINISTERING IT. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND AN ELIMINATION OF THAT BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE AND MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT, YOU WOULD HAVE THAT 31% GO MORE TO DIRECT CARE. SO THOSE THAT SAY YOU NEED TO INCREASE THE TAX, YOU NEED TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE, I BELIEVE WE REQUEST DO IT WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND COVER ALL AMERICANS AND CONTROL COSTS AND BE FAIR. ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN IS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE PART OF IT. EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A COOPERATIVE COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. CATIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN A FEW YEARS. I BELIEVE IT'S DOABLE. [APPLAUSE] . >> I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION. AND THAT WOULD BE -- SO YOU PROPOSE BASICALLY BUILDING ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. AND ATTACKING THIS PROBLEM FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. WHICH ONE DO YOU DO FIRST? >> YOU HAVE TO DO THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. YOU HAVE TO EXPAND COST AND EXPAEND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. I PROPOSED, AS YOU SAID, SOME NEW IDEAS WITHIN AN EXISTING SYSTEM. THE NEW IDEAS ARE THE TRADE BETWEEN MEDICARE AND MEAD INDICATED. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATES DO SPEND MONEY ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THE NEW INITIATIVE WOULD BE WITH THIS GENTLEMEN PROPOSED AND THAT IS LED ALL AMERICANS, BUSINESSES, FAMILIES BE PART OF THE FEDERAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT THE CONGRESS ENJOYS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIZABLE POPULATION. GIVE THEM ACCESS. ANYWHERE THEY WANT TO GO. IF IT'S TWO BLOCKS FROM THEIR HOME, THEY HAVE TO DRIVE MILES AND MILES. THIS IS ALL NEW WITHIN AN EXISTING SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY, JUST FIND WAYS TO INSURE THAT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP. I'M A GOVERNOR. IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO GET WAIVERS TO DO SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THE SCIEU TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE BUREAUCRACY STRATEGIALS OUR SYSTEM SO MUCH THAT A MAJOR COMPONENT HAS TO BE A WAY TO TAME THE BUREAUCRACY SO THAT IT WORKS FOR PEOPLE AND NOT AGAINST PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GOVERNOR RICHARDSON. . [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. [APPLAUSE] . >> THAT IS NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR BILL RICHARDSON FINISHING UP THESE 20 MINUTES HERE AT THE HEALTHCARE FORUM. RICHARDSON'S PLAN FOCUSES HEAVILY ON EARLY PREVENTION. WE'RE NOW WAITING FOR THE NEXT SPEAKER. >> THE NEXT SPEAKER WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THIS MORNING IS ILLINOIS SENATOR BARAK OBAMA. . [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) >> THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYBODY. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING TO SPONSOR THIS, THANKS TO CAPS FOR THE OUTSTANDING WORK YOU DO. BUT MOST OF ALL THANKS TO SEIU. [CHEERS] I'VE GOT A HISTORY WITH THIS UNION. WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ORGANIZER THAT HAD JUST MOVED TO CHICAGO, I STARTED WORKING WITH SCEIU LOCAL 880 HOME HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE REGISTERED TO VOTE AND HAD A SAY IN THE POLITICS IN ILLINOIS. WHEN I WENT TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE, I WORKED WITH TOM BALLONOFF TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN WHO DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE GOT -- RECEIVED IT AND WE MADE SURE THAT HOSPITALS HAD TO REPORT ON THE QUALITY OF CARE AND THE STAFFING RATIOS THAT THEY HAD SET UP. AND NOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS, NOT JUST SOME AMERICANS ARE ALLOWED TO PROSPER. BUT THE THING THAT I APPRECIATE MOST ABOUT SCEIU IS YOU GUYS RECOGNIZE THAT WORLD IS NOT STANDING STILL. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THE VALUES THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AND WE HAVE TO ADAPT THEM TO NEW TIMES. WE KNOW WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE BECAUSE OF GLOBALIZATION, BECAUSE OF AUTOMATION. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS INCREASINGLY A SITUATION IN WHICH THE BENEFITS OF THIS NEW ECONOMY ACCRUED TO JUST SOME AND LEFT TOO MANY BEHIND. WAGES, SALARIES, AND BENEFITS ARE DIMINISHED. THE MESSAGE WE'VE HEARD OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS IS YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. THE TROUBLES, THE DIFFICULTIES, THE BURDENS OF GLOBALIZATION ARE GOING TO BE PLACED ON THE BACKS OF WORKERS. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN ANOTHER VISION THAT SAYS WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER AND THAT THE BURDENS AND BENEFITS OF THIS NEW ECONOMY HAVE TO BE SPREAD EVENLY ACROSS THE ECONOMY. NO WHERE DO WE SEE THAT MORE THAN IN THE ISSUE OF HEALTHCARE. EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THE STATISTICS. WE AS A NATION SPEND $2 TRILLION EVERY YEAR, MORE THAN ANY NATION ON WORTH, AND YET WE STILL HAVE 47 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED, 9 MILLION CHILDREN WHO ARE UNINSURED. WE'VE GOT FAMILIES WHO ARE BEING BANKRUPTED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RISING COSTS, AND WE'VE GOT BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING RENDERED UNCOMPETITIVE BECAUSE OF THESE RISING COSTS. NOW EVERYBODY ON THIS STAGE IS GOING TO HAVE A PLAN TO MOVE THIS HEALTHCARE DEBATE FORWARDAS TO HOW I WOULD APPROACH THE BASIC PRINCIPAL BY THE END OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT'S FIRST TERM, BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IN THE UNITED STATES. . >> EVERY FOUR YEARS WE HEAR SOMEBODY HAS GOT A HEALTH CARE PLAN CARRIED EVERY FOUR YEARS SOMEBODY TROTS OUT ON WHITE PAPER, THEY POSTED ON THE WEB. BUT THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES IS, DO WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL AND THE SENSE OF URGENCY TO ACTUALLY GET IT DONE? I WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR GETTING IT DONE. I WILL JUDGE MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT BASED ON THE FACT ON WHETHER WE HAVE DELIVERED THE KIND OF HEALTH CARE THAT EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES AND THAT OUR SYSTEM CAN AFFORD IT. I'M NOT GOING TO BE WILL TO DO IT ON MY OWN CY HOEKE SEIU AND SUPPING A PARTNER IN THE PROCESS. THANKS EVERYBODY. >> THINK HE CENTER. YOU GAVE A SPEECH IN JANUARY, WHERE YOU SAID THAT THE TIME FOR HALF STEPS AND THE TIME FOR HALF MEASURES AND HEALTH CARE IS OVER WITH. BUT THUS FAR, WE HAVE NOT SEEN A PLAN FROM YOU GET, AND SO I'M GOING TO TURN MY FIRST QUESTION OVER TO MORGAN MILLER, WHO WENT ON THE WEBSITE LOOKING FOR SOME SPECIFIC ANSWERS AND DID NOT FIND THEM. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO ASK YOU THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS NOW. MORGAN. >> WHERE IS MORGAN? IS MORGAN OVER HERE? HI. MORGAN. >> AS MANY AMERICANS I WOULD HONOR WEBSITES TO FIND SOME INFORMATION ABOUT YOU, AND ALL I SAW WHEN IT CAME TO ADDRESSING THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE WAS THINGS LIKE HIV, WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND ISSUES LIKE LEAD POISONING. SO I WAS WONDERING, WHAT REALLY ARE YOUR TOP ISSUES WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE? ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS THIS INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLINE. >> KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR CAMPAIGN NOW IS I THINK A LITTLE OVER EIGHT WEEKS OLD, AND SO WE WILL BE PUTTING A VERY DETAILED PLAN ON OUR WEBSITE. ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE OF IS -- I'M NOT SURE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE CAMPAIGN WEBSITE OR MISSENT WEBSITE. WE HAVE NOT TRANSITIONED ALL THAT INFORMATION FOR MERSON IT WEB SITE TO THE CAMPAIGN WEBSITE. BUT AS AS I INDICATED BEFORE MY COMMITMENT IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT. THERE ARE SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES THAT THIS PLAN WILL HAVE. NUMBER ONE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS IN. NUMBER TWO, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE APPLY SOME PRINCIPLES THAT I THINK EVERY EXPERT AGREES TO IN TERMS OF HOW WE SAVE MONEY AND GET MORE OUT OF THE DOLLAR'S WHERE ARE SPENDING. FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE GOT TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO PREVENTION. IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR CHILDREN TO BE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR TREATABLE AILMENTS LIKE ASTHMA. AND IF WE'RE GIVING THEM A REGULAR CHECKUPS WITH THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, THEN WHERE WE TO SAVE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM. 20% OF OUR PATIENTS WHO HAVE CHRONIC ILLNESSES ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE COSTS. AND SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE INVEST IN MANAGING THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES LIKE DIABETES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE HIRE A CASE MANAGER TO WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE THEY'RE TAKING THE PROPER TREATMENT, THEN POTENTIALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND $30,000 ON A LEG AMPUTATION IT THERE DIABETIC. APPLICATIONS OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY CAN NOT ONLY REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, BUT COULD ALSO IMPROVE QUALITY. AND REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS. WE'RE PLEDGE AT TO TAKE THE SAVINGS AND APPLY THEM TO THOSE PERSONS WHO CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE SO THAT THEY CAN BUY INTO THE SYSTEM SO WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THEM IN SOME FASHION. ANOTHER PRINCIPLE IS IS THAT IS COY TO HAVE TO BE SOME FORM OF POOLING OF COSTS AND RISKS IN THEIR ROOM TO BE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS OUT THERE. I HEARD IT IN SOME OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT ONE POOL WOULD BE THE FEDERAL PULL THE PARTY EXISTS FOR MYSELF AND OTHER FEDERAL WORKERS. SOME STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS ARE DECIDING TO SET UP THEIR POOLS. WHATEVER THE MECHANISM WHEREBY TO HAVE TO HAVE A COOLING SYSTEM SO THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE BENEFITS OF BEING PART OF A LARGER GROUP. THE FINAL THING I WILL MENTION IS WERE I TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SERIOUS ABOUT QUALITY AND HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY. NOT ONLY TO WE HAVE TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO PREVENTION, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE, IF A GENERIC WORKS JUST AS WELL AS A BRAND NAME DRUG, THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWING DRUG COMPANIES TO DICTATE WHAT IS ON THE FORMULARY, WHAT DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER A PLAN. BUT MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS SPENT ON THE MOST EFFICIENT DRUG FOR THAT PARTICULAR DISEASE. IF WE DO ALL THOSE THINGS, I BELIEVE THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T AND UP WITH A KIND OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS HIGH-QUALITY BASIC HEALTH CARE. NOW I PROMISE YOU THIS WILL -- IF WE HAVE ANOTHER FORM IN A COUPLE MONTHS AND IT IS STILL NOT THERE, I WILL BE IN TROUBLE. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, ON THE QUESTION THAT IS REALLY THE LYNCH PIN OF ALL THESE OTHER QUESTIONS, WHICH IS COVERAGE, THEIR ONLY IF YOU WAYS OF GETTING THERE. COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE YOU ARE THINKING IS ON THIS. HAVE YOU ACCEPTED OR REJECTED ANY OF THE CONCEPTS LIKE AN EMPLOYER MANDATE OR REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS PROVIDE COVERAGE. IN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE OR PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BUY INTO THE THAT THE SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THE AUTO INSURANCE. ARE YOU BUDDED TO THIS IDEA AS THE FIRST TO CANDIDATES WERE, THAT WE BASICALLY SHOULD STICK WITH THIS SYSTEM IN WHICH MOST PEOPLE GET THEIR COVERAGE FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS, OR HAVE YOU FOUND ANY POSITIVES TO THE IDEA THAT IS BEING OFFERED BY YOUR COLLEAGUE, RON WYDEN, TO ESSENTIALLY BREAK THE SYSTEM AND COME UP WITH ANYONE? COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHICH POSSIBILITY'S HERE INTREAT YOU AND WHICH ONES THAT MAYBE YOUR DISMISSING AT THIS POINT? >> WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UNVEILING. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SET UP A SERIES OF ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCE IT, NOT JUST WITH EXPERTS, WHICH WE PARTY THEN, RATHER WITH FRONT-LINE WORKERS, WITH NURSES COME WITH DOCTORS, WITH CONSUMERS, WHICH WERE GOING TO SCHEDULE THE NEXT COUPLE COUPLE OF MONTHS. LET ME ADDRESS A COUPLE OF POINTS. AS I INDICATED BEFORE, I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SOME SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN BUY INTO A LARGER POOL. RIGHT NOW THERE POOL TYPICALLY AS THEIR EMPLOYER, BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF DOING IT. I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD SET UP A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THOSE WHO CANNOT GO THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER TO ACCESS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM FOR A STATE POOL OF SOME SORT, BUT I DON'T THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE EMPLOYER COVERAGE IMMEDIATELY. THERE IS QUICK TO BE POTENTIALLY A TRANSITION PROCESS. I CAN ENVISION A DECADE OUT OR 15 OR 20 YEARS OUT WHERE WE'VE GOT A MUCH MORE PORTABLE SYSTEM. EMPLOYER STILL HAVE THE OPTION OF PROVIDING COVERAGE, BUT MANY PEOPLE MAY FIND THAT THEY GET BETTER COVERAGE FOR AT LEAST COVERAGE THAT GIVES THEM MORE FOR THE HEALTH CARE DOLLARS THEY SPEND OUTSIDE OF THEIR EMPLOYER. I THINK WE HAVE TO FACILITATE THAT AND LET INDIVIDUALS MAKE THAT CHOICE TO TRANSITION OUT OF EMPLOYER COVERAGE. I DO BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY OR PLAY. I THINK THAT EMPLOYERS EITHER HAVE TO PROVIDE HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES OR THEIR HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HELP PAY FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYER SYSTEM. AT THINK THAT IS ONE IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE. AS I SAID, THE SECOND IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO THAT PUT MORE MONEY INTO IN PREVENTION, CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT, MORE MONEY INTO MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCRUE THE SAVINGS THAT HELP US PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO THOSE WHO DO NOT ALREADY HAVE IT. >> THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> NOW I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO A QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR U.N.L.V. STUDENTS WHO IS HERE, AND I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ASSUMING THIS IS A MALE. MICHAEL BLYVILLE, A JOURNALISM STUDENT. I PROBABLY OUGHT TO TALK TO AFTERWARDS ABOUT THE WISDOM OF THAT. ARE YOU HERE MICHAEL? >> YES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MAJOR DISPARITIES -- WHERE YOU MIGHT? >> CURRENTLY THERE MAJOR DISPARITIES IN BOTH ACCESS TO INSURANCE AND RACIAL AND MINORITIES. HELLYER PLAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE? >> WELL, ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS THAT THERE ARE DISPARITIES IS THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS AMERICANS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY NOT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND SO, IF WE SET UP A SYSTEM WHICH EVERYBODY HAS HEALTH INSURANCE, SOME OF THOSE DISPARITIES ARE MEALY GOING TO BE REDUCED. I'M SURE WHEN OF THE STATISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IS THAT CLOSE TO 80% OF THOSE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE WORK. IN SOME CASES, FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BUT DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. [APPLAUSE] THEY'RE CLEANING BEDPANS AND CLEANING FLOORS AND HOSPITALS. THEY UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME SYSTEM FOR WHICH THERE CRITICAL PART OF. SO THOSE GROUPS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY MINORITY. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP. THERE SOME PARTICULAR ISSUES WITHIN IT THE MINORITY COMMUNITY I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS IN A TARGETED WAY. MORGAN EARLIER MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF LEAD PAINT. NOW THAT MAY SEEM LIKE AN ANCILLARY ISSUE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IN CITIES LIKE CHICAGO , THE INCIDENCE OF LEAD POISONING AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO YOUTH IS SKY-HIGH AND HIS USE RAMIFICATIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR LONG TERM HEALTH. OBESITY AND DIABETES IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES IS MORE SEVERE, AND SO I THINK TARGETED PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY TO CHILDREN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE GOT SOUND ATTRITION, THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND NOT JUST POTPIES -- THAT THEY HAVE THE SENSE SPACES TO PLAY AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES INSTEAD OF JUST BEING COOPED UP IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY. THOSE ARE SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE THINK WE CAN TARGET THE MINORITY COMMUNITY. WE ARE DIMENSION HIV AIDS, THE INCIDENCE IS GROWING MUCH HIGHER IN POOR POPULATIONS AND THOSE TEND TO BE MINORITY POPULATIONS. SO MAKING SURE WE'RE PUTTING MONEY INTO H.I.V. AND AIDS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES I THINK WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE. THERE WILL BE AREAS WHERE WE TARGET SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUED MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE COULD DO IS MAKE SURE EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS COVERAGE, EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS ACCESS TO BASIC PRIMARY-CARE, AND PREVENTATIVE CARE. WE'RE DOING THAT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE DISPARITIES CLOSE SIGNIFICANTLY. [APPLAUSE] >> NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION BY E-MAIL FROM WENDY AND OAK VIEW, CALIFORNIA. SHE WANTS TO KNOW, IS THE SINGLE MOTHER WHO MEETS THE BILLS BUT NOT MUCH MORE, I FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS, MAKING TOO MUCH FOR STATE ASSISTANCE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE. SO WHAT WE DO FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME? >> WELL, I THINK THAT IS THE GROUP I JUST REFERRED TO. WORKING PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING BENEFITS ON THE JOB, DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM A SUBSIDY SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS HEALTH INSURANCE. IT IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. IF YOU ARE WORKING FULL TIME IN THIS ECONOMY, THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE. ONE THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE A LOT OF SMALL EMPLOYERS, WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET HEALTH CARE TO THEIR WORKERS, BUT THEY THEMSELVES CANNOT AFFORD IT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO LARGE ENOUGH POOLS TO ALLOW THEM TO SAVE MONEY. THAT IS WHY I THINK IS MY TO BE IMPORTANT FOR US, IN WHATEVER SYSTEM WE SET UP, TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE EMPLOYER BASED SYSTEM, THAT WE HAVE GOT AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT GETTING IT THROUGH THE JOB CAN ACCESS. NOW, I JUST HAVE TO REPEAT SOMETHING I SAID EARLIER. I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF THIS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGE FOR US IS TO BUILD A POLITICAL CONSENSUS AROUND THE NEED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THEY'RE ONLY A HANDFUL OF OPTIONS. YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THEM THAT ARE OUT THERE. JOHN EDWARDS HAS PUT OUT A PLAN, WHICH I THINK IS VERY CREDIBLE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. I WAS LISTENING TO GOV. RICHARDS AND AND HE IS THAT SOME GOOD IDEAS. EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE GOOD IDEAS. THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE ABLE TO BRING A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE RUN THE NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM NOW? ONE THING THAT MAKES ME FEEL MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS THAN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TENDERED 12 YEARS AGO IS THE FACT THAT BUSINESS IS FEELING THE PINCH. LARGE CORPORATIONS RECOGNIZE THAT THEY CANNOT BE COMPETITIVE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE IF THEIR HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE RISING AT A CONSTANT CLIP AND THAT COMPETITORS DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE IT IS ALL COVERED THROUGH A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. SMALL BUSINESSES KNOW THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT GOING TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE IF THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. SO, WHAT I THINK IS AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS TO BRING BUSINESS, LABOUR, CONSUMERS, PROVIDERS TOGETHER AND STAY FOCUSED ON IT FOR A YEAR, TWO YEARS, HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS. [APPLAUSE] SPEAK ONE MORE QUESTION. WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION. I REALIZING YOUR PLAN IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, WE'VE HEARD SOME DISAGREEMENT ON THE STATE ALREADY TODAY ABOUT WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT RAISING CORTEXES. HAVE YOU COME INTO THIS WITH A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS OR ARE YOU GOING TO PUT TAXES ON THE TABLE OR TAKEN OFF NOW? >> IT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY ON THE FRONT END INTO CREATING A NEW SYSTEM. LET ME TAKE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT USING MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY TO CUT DOWN ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, BUREACRACY, MAKE SURE WE DO NOT HAVE EVERYTHING SIGNED IN TRIPLICATE EVERY TIME YOU GO INTO A HOSPITAL. DOCTORS AND NURSES AND PHARMACISTS ARE COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY THROUGH PA INSTEAD OF WRITING, SCRIBBLING NOTES NOBODY CAN READ, IF WE DO ALL THOSE THINGS THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITY HOSPITALS OUT THERE THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE COMPUTERIZATION AND THE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS TO SET THAT UP. WE MAY NEED TO SUBSIDIZE THEM. WHY DO HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY IN ON THE FRONT END. I THINK THAT WE CAN, BY MAKING THE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT, GET A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND USE THAT TO HELP SUBSIDIZE WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE IT AND TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM. I HAVE NOT YET MADE THE DECISION IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MONEY IS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MEET MICHAEL OF INSURING THAT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE EXISTS IN THIS COUNTRY WITHIN SIX YEARS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES BECAUSE I THINK, OVER THE LONG TERM, IT IS GOOD FOR FAMILIES, IT IS GOOD FOR BUSINESSES, IT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. I HAVE NOT FORECLOSED THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MY GOAL, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE SAVED IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND I ALSO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THAT WE MAY BE PUTTING IN SOME FRONT IN INVESTMENTS, WE MAY HAVE TO SPEND SEVERAL EXTRA BILLION DOLLARS ON THE FRONT AND AS WE TRANSITION TO A MORE INTELLIGENT SYSTEM. WE WILL GET THOSE SAVINGS ON THE BACK END. ONE PLUS POINT I WOULD MAKE IT A WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SAVINGS GOING TO THE POCKETS OF FAMILIES AND NOT INSURANCE COMPANIES OR DRUG COMPANIES. THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. [APPLAUSE] SO ONE OF MY PRIORITIES IS, IF WE CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM, WHATEVER THE MECHANISM IS, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES ARE SEEING LOWER PREMIUMS, LOWER COPAYMENTS, AND ALSO THAT HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS ARE NOT GETTING SQUEEZED IN THIS PROCESS OF MAKING A MORE EFFICIENT. I GET MOST OF SKERRITT WHEN I START HEARING THE BEST WE TO SAVE THE SYSTEM IS TO CUT REIMBURSEMENTS, TO HOSPITALS OR TO CUT REIMBURSEMENTS TO DOCTORS , OR STOP GIVING RAISES TO NURSES, OR HAVE NURSES WORK TEN, 12, 15 PATIENTS OR 20 PATIENTS. THAT IS NOT REALLY SAVING THE SYSTEM. ALL THAT IS DOING IS IS COMPOUNDING SOME OF THE ERRORS WERE MADE IN THE SYSTEM. OKAY? >> THANK YOU GUYS. THANK YOU. >> YOU ARE WATCHING ILLINOIS SENATOR BARACK OBAMA LEAVE THE STAGE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE WAITING NOW FOR FORMER FIRST LADY, HILLARY CLINTON. >> THE NEXT CANDIDATES WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM THIS MORNING IS SENATOR KELLY BROUGHT HIM CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> IT IS NICE TO SEE YOU. >> WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO STAND OR SIT? >> WELL, HELLO EVERYONE. I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE AND TO BE PART OF THIS DEBATE. FIRST, I THINK WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SEND OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO ELIZABETH AND JOHN EDWARDS, AND I AM VERY -- [APPLAUSE] I AM VERY IMPRESSED BY ELIZABETH STRENGTH AND OPTIMISM AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING BOTH ELIZABETH AND JOHN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL GOING FORWARD. AND THEY WANT TO THANK YOU AND L.B. FOR HOSTING THIS. IS GREAT TO BE HERE AND TO BE IN ONE OF THE EARLY CAUCUS STATES. I WANT TO THANK CAP, THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, FOR ALL THAT CAP IS DOING TO PUT HEALTH CARE ON THE AGENDA FOR AMERICA. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK SEIU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR -- ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE BUT ACTUALLY REPRESENTING PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND TAKE CARE OF ALL OF US ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK AND THE STERN FOR BEING A LEADER, A VISIONARY LEADER ON THIS. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY NEW YORK STATE 1199 SEIU MEMBERS, WHO I AM PROUD TO WORK WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY. NOW DO YOU KNOW, I FEEL LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS IS DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN. I WORKED WITH SOME OF THE WHO ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN WE TRY TO CONVINCE THE COUNTRY AND THE CONGRESS-BUT WE CONVINCED THE COUNTRY BUT WE DID NOT CONVINCE THE CONGRESS THAT WE NEEDED, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY TO MOVE TOWARD AND ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. NOW, I AM PROUD WE TRIED. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED, BUT WE SET THE GROUNDWORK IN PLACE SO THAT NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING, BOY, WE WISH WE HAD DONE THAT BACK THEN. BECAUSE COSTS HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PRESSURES ON THE SYSTEM, ON OUR DOCTORS, OUR NURSES, OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE JUST BEEN SO STRESSFUL. I MEAT COURSES EVERY DAY, WHO TELL ME THEY'RE THINKING OF QUITTING THE PROFESSION THEY LOVE BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING TO WORK OVERTIME, THEY NOW HAVE TO NURSES COVERING WHERE 45 USE TO COVER, THERE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED IT, AND EACH ONE OF YOU COULD TELL ME A STORY LIKE THAT. SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE A COMMITMENT, AND I AM PROUD THAT EVERYONE RUNNING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS COMMITTED TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. [APPLAUSE] NOW WE WERE ONLY GIVEN THREE MINUTES AND AS SOME OF DO YOU KNOW I COULD TALK THREE HOURS OR THREE DAYS ABOUT HEALTH CARE. LET ME BRIEFLY SAY, NUMBER ONE, I AM IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THAT BRINGS IN THE 47 MILLION WHO ARE UNINSURED, WHICH IS A DISGRACE IN OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THAT BEGINS TO GUARANTEE COVERAGE TO PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE INSURANCE, BECAUSE LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE INSURANCE EXCEPT WHEN NEEDED. I MET A WOMAN IN AUSTIN TX LESLI CASSETTE I'M A TEACHER, SENATOR, I MAKE $38,000 I HAVE INSURANCE THROUGH MY EMPLOYER, THE LAST YEAR SPENT $19,000 OUT OF MY POCKET, HALF OF INCOME, BECAUSE SHE HAD A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. SO WE CANNOT GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE UNLESS WE AND INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] NOW I DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL I PRESIDENT TO DO THAT. AND GOING TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION WHILE I'M IN THE SENATE TO END INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION, GUARANTEED COVERAGE, NO MORE CHERRY PICKING , YOU CANNOT ELIMINATE PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE NEED INSURANCE FOR. WE HAVE NOW MET THE HUMAN GENO. WERE QUICK TO FIND OUT WHERE ALL SUSCEPTIBLE TO SOMETHING. NONE OF THIS IS LIKE TO BE INSURABLE OF WE DON'T CHANGE THE SYSTEM, AND I THINK WE NEED TO START NOW IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME SENSE OUT OF IT AND GET PEOPLE THE COVERAGE THEY DESERVE TO HAVE. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THE MONEY WE HAVE GOT IN THE SYSTEM. WE ALREADY SPEND MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AND WE DON'T GET THE BEST RESULTS. BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THESE UNINSURED PEOPLE AND ALL THESE UNDER INSURED PEOPLE, AND MANY OF YOU AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY, WHO CANNOT AFFORD YOUR DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS, YOU GO WITHOUT CARE AND THE PROBLEM GETS WORSE. WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE QUALITY, CONTROL COSTS, AND WE'RE GOING TO ONCE AND FOR ALL HAVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IS WORTHY OF OUR COUNTRY. ALBINO PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYBODY HOW HARD THIS WILL BE. I KNOW, I'VE GOT THE SCARS TO SHOW FOR IT. I HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT, BUT THAT MAKES ME MORE DETERMINED. IT ALSO MAKES METRES AND WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. WE GOT TO MODERNIZE AND REFORM THE WAY WE DELIVER HEALTH CARE, BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE FINANCE HEALTH CARE. AND THAT IS GOING TO MEAN TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO MAKE OUT REALLY WELL RIGHT NOW. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG POLITICAL BATTLE. WHAT I AM DOING IN MY CAMPAIGN IS TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE EVERY CHANCE I GET, ASKING PEOPLE FOR YOUR IDEAS, YOUR SUGGESTIONS. I WAS LISTENING TO QUESTIONS ASKED, THE GREAT QUESTIONS, THEY DESERVE ANSWERS. WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. BUT, IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT TO GET HAVE A BILL FOR THE CONGRESS, WE COULD KEEP TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED WILL KEEP GOING UP. WE'LL KEEP SPENDING MORE MONEY AND WE WON'T HAVE MUCH TO SHOW FOR IT. SO WE DON'T ONLY BE CANDIDATES TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WE DON'T JUST BE CANDIDATES TO HAVE A PLAN. WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE PLANS, THAT IS NOT IN DOUBT. WE NEED A MOVEMENT. WE NEED PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS THE NUMBER ONE VOTING ISSUE IN THE 08 ELECTION TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS AND THE SPECIAL INTEREST, WE'RE SERIOUS AND WERE QUICK TO GET IT DONE THIS TIME. [APPLAUSE] SO, AS I SAID KAREN I COULD KEEP TALKING BUT I AM SURE MY TIME FOR THE THREE MINUTES IS UP. LET ME TURN NOW TO QUESTIONS. >> THANKS A LOT. WELL, I WAS INTRIGUED BY, EACH IS MADE. YOU SAID WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE FINANCE THE SYSTEM BY TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DOING WELL NOW. SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? >> WELL, LET'S START WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES. [APPLAUSE] THE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAKE MONEY BY SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY AND EMPLOYING A LOT OF PEOPLE TO TRY TO AVOID INSURING YOU COME AND THEN IF YOU ARE INSURED, TO TRY TO AVOID PAYING FOR THE HEALTH CARE YOU RECEIVED. AND I SEE THIS ALL THE TIME. MY OFFICE SPENDS A LOT OF EFFORT HELPING PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE GET HEALTH CARE CARED TOO QUICK EXAMPLES. A FATHER CALLED ME FROM NORTHERN NEW YORK. YET THE SUN WITH A VERY SERIOUS AILMENT. HE WAS WELL INSURED, HE WORKED, HAD WORKED FOR A LONG TIME FOR THE SAME EMPLOYER WHO GAVE HIM A GOOD POLICY. HIS SON NEEDED A SPECIAL OPERATION AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THAT. IT WAS ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY THAT REALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID, I AM SORRY THAT IS OUT OF NETWORK, YOU HAVE HEARD THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEND YOU TO HAVE IT THEN. MY OFFICE INTERVENED. WE GET A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION WHEN I CALL. WE SAID, WE'LL THINK THIS IS RIGHT. THIS MAN HAS PAID HIS SHARE OF HIS PREMIUMS, HIS EMPLOYER HAS BARGAINED FOR THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE. SO, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, WE GOT THE OPERATION BUT I JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO THEIR U.S. SENATOR DEGETTE THERE INSURANCE COMPANY TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE. [APPLAUSE] SECOND FESTS STORY. WE'RE HAVING AN EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES, YOU WILL KNOW THAT. WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH ADULT ONSET DIABETES CARE THE I'M TALKING 12, 13, 15, 16 YEAR OLDS. WE'RE SEEING THE COST OF TIDIEST GO UP EXPEDITIOUSLY. WELL, A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NOT PAY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS PREDIABETIC OR BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES, TO GO TO NUTRITIONISTS TO FIND OUT HOW BETTER TO FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES, TO GO TO THE PODIATRIST TO HAVE THEIR FEET TRACT. BUT THEY WILL PAY IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR FOOT AMPUTATED. BECAUSE THE REASONING IS, AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL TELL YOU THIS, THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THAT IS LIKE A LOST AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SURE THAT THE PATIENT OR THE INSURED PERSON WILL STILL BE WITH THEM. BUT THEY'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE DOCTORS AND WE'RE GONNA DO HAVE TO AMPUTATE THE FOOT, THEY'RE KIND OF STUCK WITH IT. THAT IS UPSIDE DOWN AND BACKWARDS. SO WE COULD SAVE MONEY IF WE CHANGED THE INCENTIVES TO REQUIRE THAT PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AND WE'LL THIS BE COVERED AND INCENTIVIZED AND WE COULD REQUIRE THAT EVERY INSURANCE COMPANY HAD TO ENSURE EVERYBODY AND NO EXCLUSIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND THAT WOULD BE ONE THING WE COULD DO. [APPLAUSE] >> SPEAKING OF THE LATEST FINANCE, WHEN YOU DO COME UP WITH THEIR PLAN THIS TIME, IS IT GOING TO ONCE AGAIN INCLUDE WHAT WAS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECT OF YOUR PLAN LAST TIME, WHICH WAS THIS EMPLOYER MANDATE, THE REQUIREMENT THAT COMPANIES COVER THEIR WORKERS? WHAT ALSO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY AUTO INSURANCE AND THE MODEL WE HAVE SEEN PUT FORWARD IN MASSACHUSETTS AND CALIFORNIA? >> WELD THEIR ONLY COUPLE OF WAYS TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND I AM PLEASED THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, BOTH RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND IN THE CONGRESS, ARE SAYING LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO ONE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT'S CLEAR CLEAR TO BUILD ON EMPLOYER BASED SYSTEM, NO MORE FREE WRITERS, NO MORE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT INSURE EVERYBODY AND SHIFT THEIR COSTS ON TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT DO AND ON TO THE TAXPAYER. SO EVERY EMPLOYER IS GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE OR PAY INTO A POOL, WHERE THAT MONEY CAN BE USED TO HELP PEOPLE. AND WE MAY HAVE TO SAY LOOK, IT IS EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO BE INJURED. SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE COME UP TO ME -- AND I UNDERSTAND THIS. AND THEY SAY THINGS LIKE, DO YOU KNOW, I AM HEALTHY. I DON'T NEED INSURANCE. I WILL SAY WELL, DO YOU DRIVE CARS? HAVE YOU EVER DRIVEN A MOTORCYCLE? DO YOU WALK ACROSS THE STREET AND SOMETIMES NOT LOOK ALIKE? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENS YOU. INSURANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU, YOU'LL BE TAKEN CARE AND FRANKLY IT IS TO PROTECT REST OF US WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES. WE'RE BEING RESPONSIBLE. I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED THAT ON BOTH ENDS OF OUR COUNTRY, IN MASSACHUSETTS AND CALIFORNIA, AN IDEA WE FIRST FLOATED IN 1984. INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE SO IF YOUR EMPLOYER DOES NOT PROVIDE IT AND YOU ARE NOT COVERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT-FUNDED PROGRAMS, THEN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE IN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN TO YOU, YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYBODY ELSE. SO THE SO-CALLED INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY. I THINK THAT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE, AND THEIR PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT CUED WHERE CAN THEY GO TO GET A GOOD POLICY? WE HAVE TO REALLY GOOD PROGRAMS OPERATING RIGHT NOW, MEDICARE WHICH TAKES CARE PEOPLE OVER 65 HAS THE LOWEST ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF ANY INSURANCE PROGRAM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH PRIVATE INSURANCE CHARGES FOR ADMINSTRATION AND OVERHEAD AND PROFIT OF COURSE, YOU COMPARE WITH MEDICARE. THERE'S NO COMPARISON. MEDICARE IS LIKE 3% COMPARED TO ANYTHING FROM TEN TO 35 WERE UP. WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN. PEOPLE LIKE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEY CAN GO TO THIS POOL -- IT'S A BIG SHARING ARRANGEMENT, AND THEY CAN HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHOICES. FINNEGAN PICKLE EXCITIVE INSURANCE POLICY. THEY'RE YOUNG AND THINK THE ONLY NEED CATASTROPHIC CARE, THEY CAN GET THAT. IF THEY HAVE KIDS WITH SOME KIND OF PROBLEM, THEY CAN GET COVERAGE FOR THAT. SO WE CAN LOOK AT HOW WE PROVIDE A BACKUP GOVERNMENT SPONSORED APPROACH TO COMPLEMENT THE EMPLOYER SYSTEM IF WE STAY WITH THE EMPLOYER SYSTEM. THE FINAL THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT IS, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN '93 AND '94 IS THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT, EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE, BUT WE DIDN'T DO GOOD ENOUGH JOB EXPLAINING IT AND WE'LL DO A BETTER JOB THIS TIME, PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CHANGE WHAT THEY HAD CARRIED A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE, SO WE WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE FEELING LIKE, OH MY GOODNESS THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO COME IN AND TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND WHAT DR. I HAVE TO GO TO. THAT WAS NEVER PART OF THE PLAN, BUT SOME PEOPLE GOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT. BUILDING ON WHAT WE HAVE AND HAVING A BRIDGE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS INCLUDED AND AT THE END OF THAT BRIDGE HAVING AN ALTERNATIVE THAT IS A GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ALTERNATIVE, GIVES PEOPLE A CHOICE. SO THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AS A FRAMEWORK, BECAUSE REALLY EVERY PLAN YOUR RIGHT TO HEAR THAT HAS SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE ELEMENTS. [APPLAUSE] >> CENTER, RIGHT NOW WOULD LIKE TO TURN THINGS OVER TO COURTNEY, IN HER JOB WITH THE CLARKE COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY SEES EVERY DAY A LOT OF THE KINDS OF PEOPLE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, PEOPLE HAVE COVERAGE BUT CANNOT AFFORD THE HEALTH CARE CARED COURTNEY ARE YOU HERE? >> HI COURTNEY. >> HELLO. I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF SEIU AND WORK FOR THE CLARKE COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY. MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT I SERVE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS ARE LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, SENIORS, AND DISABLED PEOPLE LIVING ON FIXED INCOME. MANY OF THEM HAVE HEALTH CARE BUT STILL SPENT A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF POCKET, WHICH HONESTLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO. SO, HOW AND WHAT TIME LINE ARE YOU GOING TO REIN IN HEALTH-CARE COSTS? >> THAT IS A REAL GOOD QUESTION COURTNEY BECAUSE, IF WE DON'T GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL, YOU CONNECT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN AND IT WILL STILL KEEP COSTING MORE AND MORE MONEY FOR EVERYBODY IN IT. AND EMIL LOOP WILL BE BACK TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. I WANT TO DO SEVERAL THINGS. NUMBER ONE, AS I SAID I WANT TO END INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE UNDER SOME RESTRICTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN CHARGE PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO TO THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR INSURANCE. NUMBER TWO, I HAD A BILL THAT I WORKED ON FOR FOUR YEARS IN THE SENATE TO MOVE US TO AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. WE PASSED THE SENATE, WE DID NOT PASS THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE. WERE COMING BACK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THOSE OF YOU AND HELP CARE KNOW THE ANSWER. USE BENTZEL MUCH OF YOUR TIME DOING RECORD KEEPING, TRYING TO READ RECORDS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE, TRY TO FAX RECORDS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT RIGHT HERE IN YOUR HOME AND NEED THEIR RECORDS. YOU GO TO ALL OF THIS MISPLACING RECORDS. WE ARE DROWNING, AND FRANKLY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE WE HAVE A PAPER SYSTEM IN THE HEALTH-CARE FIELD. WE DON'T RELY ON PAPER AND ANY OTHER BIG PART OF OUR ECONOMY ANYMORE. BECAUSE WE RELY ON PAPER, WE ARE WASTING MONEY. WE CAN SAVE BY AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT $100 BILLION A YEAR IF WE MOVE TOWARD ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, AND I WANT TO START REQUIRING THAT PEOPLE WHO DO BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, NAMELY MEDICARE, MEDICAID, THE A, A FEDERAL BENEFIT PLAN, THEY WILL HAVE TO MOVE TOWARD ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. I AM WILLING TO PUT SOME UP-FRONT MONEY INTO THAT TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE ALL THESE DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE IT SYSTEMS CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER. YOU ARE TAKING CARE SOMEBODY HERE IN LAS VEGAS, THEY HAVE FAMILY IN ARIZONA OR L.A., THEY GO THERE, SLIP AND FALL. THEY GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, HE START WITH THE HISTORY. HE START WITH TESTS THAT MAYBE THEY TOOK TWO WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS AGO. AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, I WENT DOWN TO HOUSTON TO SEE THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN EVACUATED, MOST OF THEM FROM THE CONVENTION CENTER, THE ELDERLY, THE FREE, PEOPLE MORE DEPENDENT ON HEALTH CARE. THEIR RECORDS ARE GONE. THOSE PIECES OF PAPER OR DESTROYED. A LOT OF THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PRESCRIPTIONS TO GET TO PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU HAD ELDERLY FOLKS WHO KNEW THEY WERE TAKING PILLS BUT DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE. I TAKE A PINK PILL IN THE MORNING IN A BLUE PILL IN THE AFTERNOON. THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS. THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY COULD HELP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAD SHOPPED AT CHAIN DRUG STORES BECAUSE THEY HAVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. IF WE HAD THAT FOR ALL OF OUR HEALTH CARE RECORDS, WE WOULD GET COSTS DOWN AND HAVE HIGHER QUALITY HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE TO DO ALL THIS AT THE SAME TIME TO HELP GET THOSE COSTS DOWN AND TO HELP PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, YOU SAID YOU CAN DO THIS WITH NO BIG NEW TAXES. SO WHERE THIS IS UP FRONT MONEY COME FROM? >> I'M TALKING FOR EXAMPLE ON THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, MAYBE $200 MILLION TO GET THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SYSTEM PUT INTO PLACE, GIVE OR TAKE MONEY. THAT IS WHAT WE ESTIMATED WHEN WE DID IT ORIGINALLY. THERE WILL BE SOME INVESTMENTS, BUT WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED TO SPEND, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE SPEND NATIONALLY. IT IS NOT JUST WITH THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS, IT IS WHAT ALL OF THIS BAND. WE ALREADY SPEND MORE MONEY THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. I CANNOT SEE US PUTTING MORE MONEY AS A NATIONAL EXPENDITURE AND TO HEALTH CARE WITHOUT MODERNIZING THE SYSTEM, WITHOUT ENDING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION, WITHOUT BEGINNING TO EMPHASIZE WELLNESS AND PREVENTION. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START TAKING BETTER CARE OF THEMSELVES. WE CANNOT AFFORD ALL THE LESS THAT FOLKS ARE BURNING ON THEMSELVES. THERE THINGS WE HAVE NO CONTROL, THERE THINGS WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER AND WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT. BUT WHAT WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IS, HOW CAN WE SAVE MONEY OVER THE LONG RUN? I AM WILLING TO PUT IN SOME UP FRONT INVESTMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS, AND I THINK WE CAN THEN SAVE MONEY IS TO GO FORWARD. BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD START FROM THE POSITION WHERE WE SIT WERE CUT TO INCREASE ALL OF THESE COSTS BY PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO A SYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN. WE HAVE TO FIX THIS SYSTEM SO IT SERVES PEOPLE BETTER. IT TAKES BETTER CARE OF THOSE WHO TAKE CARE OF US AND WE TAKE BETTER CARE OF OURSELVES, AND THAT IS THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH THIS. >> SENATOR, WE ARE HACKETTSTOWN BUT I DID WANT TO ASK YOU ONE LAST QUICK QUESTION. SEVERAL CANDIDATES WE HAVE HEARD FROM TODAY HAVE SAID THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN THEIR FIRST TERM. U.S. SUGGESTED THAT IT COULD TAKE TO TERMS, IT COULD TAKE EIGHT YEARS. ARE THEY BEING REALISTIC? >> I THINK WE ALL ARE GOING TO TRY TO START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE MEDICARE SUBSCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT. I DID NOT VOTE FOR, AND ITS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT EXACTLY HAVE THE GREATEST TRACK RECORD ON CONFIDENCE. IT TOOK A WHILE. I THINK WE CAN MOVE MORE QUICKLY BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THIS WE'LL BE A SERIES OF STEPS. BUT LET ME END WERE STARTED. WE'RE ALL FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WE HAD A BIG DEBATE ABOUT IT, '93 AND '94. THAT DEBATE IS OVER. THE DEMOCRATS STAND UNITED. WE'RE ALL FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE TO DO IS PERSUADE THE COUNTRY, NOT ONLY TO VOTE FOR A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO HELP ELECT A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS OF THIS, AND I KNOW PEOPLE WOULD RATHER NOT THINK ABOUT POLITICS BECAUSE THAT IS THAT A DOWNER, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS, WE GOT STOPPED IN THE SENATE IN 1994 BY A FILIBUSTER. DO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, UNLESS YOU GET 60 VOTES, UNLESS YOU HAVE MORE THAN 60 DEMOCRATS YET TO GET SOME REPUBLICANS. WE GOT STOPPED BECAUSE THEY SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. AND WE COULD NOT BREAK IT, AND THAT WAS THE END. WE CANNOT GET ENOUGH REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW TO VOTE WITH US TO TRY TO BEGIN TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ. WE CAN'T, WE'RE TRYING. EVERY SINGLE WEEK, WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE TO TRY TO GET THEM TO VOTE WITH US. THE WAY THE SENATE OR, YOU HAVE TO GET TO 60 VOTES. THAT IS WHY I SAID, I SURE HOPE YOU'LL LET ME PRESENT BUT I WANT FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AND I WANT A MOVEMENT TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE REFORM AND WE'RE GOING TO NEEDED, SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT IS WHAT WE DO IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT THIS SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON WALKING OFF THE STAGE. SHE SAYS SHE'S PROUD OF THE HEALTH-CARE BATTLE TO FOUGHT IN '93 AND '94 AND SAYS SHE'S LOOKING TO FIGHT THEM AGAIN. WAITING NOW FOR NEXT SPEAKER, SENATOR CHRIS DODD. >> OUR NEXT CANADA WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM IS SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD OF CONNECTICUT. >> GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ALL OF US TO COME BY HERE THIS MORNING TO BE A PART OF THIS PROGRAM. I THANK YOU KIRAN FOR ACTING AS THE HOST. THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, WHAT TO THANK THEM AS WELL. SEIU FOR YOUR WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP. IN THE STERN AS WELL. FOR GIVING US A CHANCE TO BE HERE. LET ME ALSO MENTION I DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM BUT I THINK ALL THIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE INCREDIBLE RESPECT FOR ELIZABETH EDWARDS AND FOR JOHN EDWARDS AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH HERE TODAY. I DID NOT WANT TO BEGIN THESE REMARKS ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND NOT BUILT TO --VILLE TO MENTION THEM AS WELL. AND DEEPLY PROUD OF THE INVITATION TO BE WITH YOU. BRAD OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SEIU AND ITS WORK OVER THE EIGHT DECADES OF SERVING IN THE INTEREST OF NOT ONLY ITS BUT PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WERE NOT MEMBERS OF SEIU WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE. I'VE BEEN THROUGH EIGHT ELECTIONS IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT AND I PRACTICE SAY THE STATE ELECTIONS I'VE HAD THE SUPPORT OF SE I U AND I THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] AND FOR THOSE 32 YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, I AM PROUD TO SAY I HAVE A 95% VOTING RECORD WITH ORGANIZED LABOR THIS COUNTRY. I STAND WITH UNIONS, I STAND WITH LABOR AND I THINK YOU AS WELL. I AM PROUD OF THAT RELATIONSHIP. I MENTIONED THAT TO THIS MORNING BECAUSE I MET THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT WHERE WE WANT TO GO FROM HERE, HOW WE WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, THE WHEELS OF A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE YOU BEEN. AND AS 32 YEARS THE WORK I'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN AT IS SOMETHING I'M PROUD OF BUT IT IS AN INDICATION OF WHAT KIND OF I WILL OFFER AS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE NINE STATES AND HOW WOULD SERVE THE COUNTRY. I AM PREACHING TO A CHOIR HERE AND TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE. WE ALL KNOW IT IS IN A SERIOUS CRISIS. THE NUMBERS ARE STARTLING. HE SAID WE HAVE RANKED 26 IN THE WORLD AND LIFE EXPECTANCY, SOMETHING LIKE 28 IN THE WORLD AND IN THE MORTALITY RATES. WE RANK SOMETHING LIKE 37TH IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF OVERALL FAIRNESS OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE COUNT FOR MORE THAN 50% OF ALL THE MONEY SPENT WORLDWIDE ON HEALTH CARE IN THE AD STATES. ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU THIS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS WORKING, THOSE FACTS ALONE OUGHT TO BE A SOURCE OF COLLECTIVE SHAME IN THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT WE RANK AS POORLY AS WE DO. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE MOST AFFLUENT COUNTRY IN HISTORY OF MANKIND. WE NEED TO BE DOING A FAR BETTER JOB IS SERVING AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE. I STAND FIRMLY IN EFFORTS TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] LET ME STATE TO YOU HERE AS WELL WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. FIRST OF ALL IT IS IMPORTED WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WE DON'T LIMIT THE CONVERSATION TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITHIN THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM ITSELF. IN THE 20TH-CENTURY WE EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCY BY 30 YEARS. ONLY FIVE OF THIS 30 YEARS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE OF IMPROVED HEALTH CARE. ABOUT 25 OF THOSE YEARS ACTUALLY COME FROM BETTER NUTRITION, BETTER HOUSING, BETTER JOBS, BETTER INCOMES FOR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT HAD MORE TO DO WITH INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ITSELF. THE REASON I MENTION THAT TO YOU IS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE EXAMINE THIS ISSUE, WE ALSO LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE INCOME INEQUALITY, THE ABILITY TO HAVE RETIREMENT, WHICH IS A WAGES, A DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS. THOSE ELEMENTS IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PEOPLE'S HEALTH. IF YOU ARE BETTER OFF FINANCIALLY, BETTER EDUCATED THAN A LIKELIHOOD IS YOU'LL BE IN BETTER HEALTH. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS , WITH A RETIREMENT IN GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS IF YOU ARE TRULY INTERESTED IN MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS IMPORTANT AS CONCEPTS AND IDEAS INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION. AS FOR THE HEALTH-CARE PROPOSALS THEMSELVES, LET ME QUICKLY MENTION THE FOUR PRINCIPLES, WHICH I THINK ARE ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ONE IS WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY FROM THE OTHERS, AND THAT IS UNIVERSALITY. THAT EVERYONE PARTICIPATES, EVERYONE BENEFITS. ALL STAKEHOLDERS, INDIVIDUALS, EMPLOYERS THE GOVERNMENT ARE INVOLVED IN COMING UP BOTH THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REDUCE NUMBERS OF 47 MILLION OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS WHO HAVE NO HEALTH CARE AND MAKE SURE THERE WILL BE INCLUDED. SECOND IS PREVENTION ALONE. WHAT WE TRIED TO DO TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE THE COST OF STOPPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING ILL IN FIRST PLACE. RENT 70% OF HEALTH-CARE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES IN AMERICA. WE NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SEE TO IT THAT PEOPLE GET SCREENING, PROPER MANAGED CARE, TO REDUCE KINDS OF PROBLEMS BEFORE THE MERGER. THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM TODAY DEALS WITH WHEN YOU GET SICK. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION WHAT ALL THE PROBLEMS AT THE SPACE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS BY 60% IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE WORK THEY'VE DONE ON PRESCREENING AND DEALING WITH PEOPLE BEFORE THEY BECOME ILL. PREVENTION HAS TO BE A MAJOR PART OF THIS. BUILD UPON THE GOOD THINGS WERE DONE ALREADY, 40 YEARS OF MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. I WOULD EXTEND MEDICAID, TO POOR FAMILIES, 100% POVERTY. THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE WORKED VERY VERY WELL FOR PEOPLE, EXPANDING THEM, EXTENDING MIMICS A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. LESLIES' THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE, DEALING WITH TECHNOLOGY. I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF THIS AS WELL. 80 OR $90 BILLION COULD BE SAVED LET ME TELL YOU WHAT ALSO IS IMPORTANT IN ALL THIS. WHEN LOOKING AT THOSE OF US WHO SEEK YOUR SUPPORT FROM THE NOMINATION. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DO DURING THE 26 YEARS IN THE SENATE I'VE TAKEN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND MADE THE NATIONAL POLICIES. SPENCE SEVEN YEARS TO PASS FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. IT WAS MY PIECE OF LEGISLATION. 50 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF THAT LEGISLATION. I STARTED THE CHILDRENS CAUCUS IN THE SENATE. I OFFERED THE LEGISLATION TO DO HEADSTART AND PROGRAMS DEALING WITH AND THEN SCREENINGS, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR CHILDREN. IN EVERY INSTANCE I'VE DONE IT BY REACHING BACK TO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY NEEDS TO BE PLAN AND A PROGRAM THAT CAN BUILD US LIMBERNESS TOGETHER. WILL NOT SURVIVE MUCH LONGER IN THIS COUNTRY DIVIDED 51, 49 CAPABILITY TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN REACH OUT TO OTHERS AND BRING THEM TO THE TABLE AND WORK OUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER. WE CANNOT WAIT MUCH LONGER. THAT IS WHAT I DO AS A LEGISLATOR. THAT IS WHAT I'LL DO AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO BRING THE STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THERE, WORK TOGETHER FOR THE COMMON GOALS WILL HAVE IN MIND AND THAT IS TO SEE THIS COUNTRY HAVE APPROVED HEALTH CARE, IMPROVED ECONOMICS FOR THE PEOPLE OF VERNATION. MAJESKI TODAY, TO LOOK NOT ONLY AT WHAT WE OFFER YOU HEAR BUT THE PROVEN ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WHERE WE STOOD OVER THE YEARS AND WE'RE REALLY IN THE FUTURE. I AM THE FATHER OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. I HOUSE RIGHT NOW IS LIKE A PETRIE DISH. I'VE GOT A FIVE-YEAR OLD AND ITS-YEAR-OLD AND ONE HAS STRUCK ROAD AND THE OTHER HAS AN INFECTION OF SOME KIND OR OTHER KIDS DEALING WITH CHILDREN AND THEIR PROBLEMS, GOING TO SCHOOL AND COMING BACK. AND THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT GETS MAIL FROM AARP AND DIAPER SERVICES. I HAVE A RATHER BROAD REACH HERE IS A CANDIDATE IN TALKING ABOUT THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT FAMILIES GO THROUGH. I AM A U.S. SENATOR. I VIEW WONDERFUL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. I WANT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE AS GOOD HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AS IT REMEMBER OF THE U.S. CONGRESS THAT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL STAND AND FIGHT FOR. I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I ASK FOR SUPPORT IN THE UPCOMING NOMINATION PROCESS AND I PROMISE AS YOUR PRESIDENT WE WILL DEAL WITH THIS HEALTH CARE ISSUE. WE WILL PULL PEOPLE TOGETHER, HAVE A GOOD SOUND HEALTH CARE PROGRAM FOR ALL AMERICANS. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU KAREN. >> SENATOR, PLEASE ONE POLITICAL COMMENTARY OUT HERE SUGGESTED YOU SHOULD WIN THE CAUCUS IF ONLY BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO BE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE FIELD AND KNOWS IT IS PRONOUNCED NEVADA. >> THAT IS CORRECT. NEVADA. YOU HAVE TO PASS AT LEAST THAT'S TEST IT SEEMS TO ME. >> YOU WERE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL COSPONSORS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH CARE BILL IN 1993. AND IT NEVER GOT SO FAR AS A VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF EITHER HOUSE. HE SUGGESTS THERE'S BEEN A FAILURE OF ON THIS ISSUE. BUT, IN FACT, ALL OF THE OLD OPPONENTS ARE STILL OUT THERE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT IS CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE, IN THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THINGS COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED ON HEALTH CARE THAT SIMPLY WERE NOT POSSIBLE IN 1994? >> I SEE A NUMBER OF THINGS. FIRST OF ALL THE COSTS ALONE, 12 OR 14 YEARS AGO THE OVERALL COSTS WHERE SOME MORELLA LESS THAN $1 TRILLION A THING. TODAY WE'RE LOOKING AT A COST FIGURE SOMEWHAT IN EXCESS OF $2.3 TRILLION. YOU ARE WATCHING INDUSTRY BEGINNING TO REDUCE THOSE HEALTH CARE PLANS. THEY'RE NOT DOING IT BECAUSE THEY'RE EVIL IN MOST CASES. THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE OF COST FACTORS. THOSE FACTORS ALONE ARE MAKING IT GREATER POSSIBILITIES FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS HURTING AS. WERE CONSUMING 16% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN HEALTH-CARE COSTS. THAT NUMBER COULD VERY EASILY JUMP TO 20 OR 25% VERY QUICKLY. THAT BECAUSE ALMOST AN UNSUSTAINABLE NO. NOT TO MENTION THAT THAT CLEARLY THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM TODAY WITH A NUMBER THAT ARE GROWING. THE IRONY HERE, WILL HAVE HEALTH CARE COSTS RISE AND THE NUMBER OF INSURED CONTINUE TO RISE. NOW WE HAVE 1 MILLION MORE PEOPLE THAN WE DID SIX YEARS AGO UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT HAVE NO HEALTH CARE AND THAT COSTS CONTINUE TO GO UP. THE CLIMATE IS A LOT BETTER FOR US TODAY. I AM NOT ENGAGING IN SOMETHING INCONCEIVABLE HERE. UNGENERIS 21, THE DAY AFTER MY BE INAUGURATED, I COULD INVITE LILLY AND CHUCK GRASSLEY, MAX BAUCUS, TED STEVENS. I AM TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE CONGRESS FOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMMITTEES THAT DEAL WITH HEALTH CARE. I HAVE KNOWN EVERY ONE OF THEM FOR 30 YEARS. NOT GOING TO SPEND A YEAR TO GETTING TO KNOW THEM. THEY KNOW ME, I KNOW THEM. WE FOUGHT AGAINST EACH OTHER, WITH WORK TOGETHER ON ISSUES. I BELIEVE BY BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SAY LET'S GIVE THIS DONE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT NOTHING LESS OF US. WE NEED TO STOP TALKING AND CHIEF THE RESULTS I THINK WE CAN HAVE. >> THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> SINCE 1994 WHEN EFFORTS -- THIS COULD HELP WITH THE ISSUES WERE HAVING. >> IS IS WORKING NOW? >> SINCE 1994 WHEN HEALTH CARE REFORM CRASHED AND BURNED, CONGRESS HAS SORT OF LIMITED ITSELF TO INCREMENTAL STEPS. YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THOSE. RIGHT NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ON PACK MORE, WHO IS AT OUR END AT YOU AND SEE, TO ASK YOU AND IT ABOUT AN ISSUE BEEN ACTIVE INCOME WHICH IS EXPANDING COVERAGE OF CHILDREN. PAT, ARE YOU HERE? WHERE HAVING MICROPHONE GREMLINS ARE WE? >> HELLO? >> TO MANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TALKING HERE. >> I AM PATMORE. THE STATE OF NEVADA WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH NUMBER OF UNINSURED CHILDREN. IT IS REALLY DISCOURAGING TO ME BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A PEDIATRIC I SEE YOU NURSE AT IMC, THE ONLY PUBLIC ON COUNTY HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN NEVADA. I SEE THE RESULTS OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PARENTS CANNOT PROVIDE OR SEEK ENTER THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND RELATIVES TOO LATE, WHEN OFTENTIMES THE RESULT IS THE DEATH OF THE CHILD. SO I WOULD ASK YOU, WHAT IS YOUR PROPOSAL, WHAT IS YOUR PLATFORM FOR ENSURING EVERY CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES? >> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR WHAT DO YOU DO AS SINNERS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE QUESTION TO POINT OUT AS WELL THAT ON THIS TUESDAY, I WILL BE INTRODUCING SOMETHING CALLED A RESPECT ACT, WHICH TAKES THESE KENTUCKY RIVER CASES, THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THESE QUESTIONS UNDERSTAND, THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD LAST YEAR DECLARED THAT ANYONE WHO WAS VOCATIONALLY A SUPERVISOR AS A NURSE WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. MY LEGISLATION OVERTURNS THAT. I THINK NURSES OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE COLLECTIVELY. AGAIN, WHAT TO THINK YOUR, THE AFL-CIO AND OTHERS ENDORSING THE LEGISLATION, KENNEDY SERVING -- AND THERE SHORTAGE ISSUE, HOW NURSES GET TREATED IS SOMETHING THAT HAS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN MY VIEW IN THE COUNTRY. I APPRECIATE YOU BRING UP THE CHILDREN'S ISSUE. I STARTED THE CHILDRENS CAUCUS IN THE SENATE WITH ARLEN SPECTER ARE. 12 MILLION UNINSURED CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY. AS GIPP PROGRAM IS SOMETHING I WAS A STRONG BACKER AND SUPPORTER OF. TO PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS. IN THAT WHEN THE FIRST CAME UP I HAVE SOME HESITANCY. ALL THIS DIDN'T TALKING ABOUT THIS. HAD THE FEELING IF WE JUST TOOK CARE OF CHILDREN, WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO DO WITH THE BROADER POPULATION. RANKLY THINGS WERE MOVING SO SLOWLY BESIDE A WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO DIRECTLY REACH OUT AND SEE TO LET THE CHILDREN WERE GETTING A FAR BETTER START IN ALL THIS. IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WOULD GET RID OF%, THREE ENDEAVOUR SAID THE PARTY WOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER MEDICAID. THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. C. EVERETT COOP -- I VOTED AGAINST WHEN HE WAS NOMINATE TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE I DID YOU READ WITH A LOT OF HIS VIEWS. HE BECAME A BEST WITNESS. THAT WAS THE RADICAL IDEA YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND TIME WITH A CHILD WITHOUT HAVING TO LOSE YOUR JOB. WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT WITH PAID LEAVE FOR PEOPLE BY THE WAY OUT HERE. BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN DURING THOSE PERIODS OF ILLNESS MCKIE HUGE DIFFERENCE. I SEE YOUR NOTTING AND YOU UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER THAN OTHERS AS A PEDIATRIC NURSE. I THINK THE AMERICAN -- GETTING INTO SOME OF THIS THAT EARLY ON. I WANT TO SEE SCHOOL BASED CLINICS IN OUR COUNTRY. I WANT TO SEE HEAD START PROGRAM THAT IS NOT JUST A LITERACY PROGRAM THAT DEALS WITH THE WHOLE CHILD. ALL OF THE BASIC THINGS, THE INVESTMENTS NOT TO BE MAKING. I AM GRACIA BEEN CHOSEN BY THE HEAD START ASSOCIATION AS A CENTER OF THE DECADE WHEN IT COMES TO A HEAD START ISSUES. I WERE THAT BAD. VERY PROUDLY. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH NEED TO BE DOING. THE ADVANCE SCREENING LEGISLATION THAT I HAVE OFFERED, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR CHILDREN, BETTER TESTING FOR THEM. WE JUST DID A MAJOR BELLAND AUTISM IN THE COUNTRY FOR CHILDREN AS WELL. I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MY TIME WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. WHEN I GOT TO THE SENATE I DISCOVERED A CAUCUS FOR EVERY CONSTITUENCY IN THE COUNTRY EXCEPT ONE OF FOUR AMERICANS TO OUR KIDS. THAT IS THE REASON IT WAS SO MUCH TIME ON IT AND I WILL AS PRESIDENT AS UNITED STATES AS WELL. I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT IT. .. >> ARE INCENTIVES FOR DRIVING UP COST. WE NEED TO REVERSE THIS AND TURN THE WHOLE SYSTEM ON ITS HEAD. IF ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TINKERING WITH THE STATUS QUO, ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MARGINALLY ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. I'M FEARFUL WE'LL BE BACK HERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SUBJECT ALL OVER AGAIN. ALL THE INCENTIVES TODAY IN HEALTH CARE ARE COST DRIVEN. WE DON'T PROVIDE THE INCENTIVES TO DO JUST THE OPPOSITE, TO ENCOURAGE THE INCENTIVES TO HAVE PROSECUTOR LIFESTYLES, TO DO THINGS THAT ARE LESS HARMFUL, TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTS. I COME BACK TO THE POINT I MADE EARLIER, THE INCENTIVES TO HAVE CLEANER ENVIRONMENT, BETTER ENERGY POLICY IN THE COUNTRY. SEEING TO IT THAT WE INSIST ON SCHOOLS, FOR INSTANCE, THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MARKET FAST FOOD OR JUNK FOOD. 49% OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE CONTRACTS WITH SOFT DRINK COMPANIES AND JUNK FOOD COMPANIES. 49%, AND THEN WE WONDER WHY KIDS HAVE OBESITY PROBLEMS AND DIABETES PROBLEMS: SO THE COST ISSUE, THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THE MONEY COME INTO A POOR SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET, SO THAT EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT IS VERY APPEALING TO THEM TO SAVE SOME MONEY. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THOSE UNDERLYING ISSUES IN MY VIEW AS WELL. SO COST I WOULD PICK AS THE MAJOR ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] >> AND GIVEN THIS PROBLEM IS WHAT IT IS AND THE URGENCY THAT PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT IT, WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF WHAT IS A REALISTIC TIME FRAME FOR GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. BARACK OBAMA SAYS IT'S FOUR YEARS, HILLARY CLINTON SAYS IT'S EIGHT YEARS. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M IMPATIENT ON. THIS I DIDN'T JUMP INTO THIS PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS BECAUSE I WOKE UP WHEN I WAS FIVE OR TEN AND DECIDED THIS WAS MY LIFE AMBITION. I'VE BEEN RELATIVELY HAPPY IN THE SENATE. I'VE GOT THESE TWO KIDS. A LATE BLOOMER. >> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? >> MY DAUGHTER GRACE WAS BORN 48 HOURS AFTER 9/11. YOU COULD LITERALLY WATCH THE PENTAGON BURNING. AND I'VE THOUGHT EVER SINCE THAT MOMENT, AS ALL OF YOU PARENT,S OR GRANDPARENTS. WHAT KIND OF A WORLD IS SHE GOING TO GROW UP IN? I FEEL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMPATIENT. I THINK WITH THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP THAT INSISTS UPON THIS BEING A PRIORITY, AND I WOULD TELL YOU I WOULDN'T PUT A TIME FRAME ON THIS, BUT I WOULD MAKE THIS THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IN A DODD ADMINISTRATION. THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE, IT GOES FAR BEYOND THE ISSUE OF ONE SET OF ISSUES. THE DANGER IN FORUMS LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO STOVE PIPE THE ISSUES. WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WHAT I TRY TODAY SAY EARLIER IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORKPLACE IN TERMS OF JOB POSSIBILITIES, INCOME, SALARIES, RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE AS WELL. ENERGY POLICY, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH CARE POLICY. SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THIS DISCUSSION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE IT'S FAR REACHING IN ITS IMPLICATIONS. I WOULD WANT TO SEE US HAVE A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM BEGINNING FAR SOONER THAN FOUR YEARS. IF YOU CAN HAVE, YOU GET RID OF THESE PERMANENT TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP 1% OF -- GET THIS WAR ENDED IN IRAQ WHERE WE'RE SPENDING $8 BILLION A MONTH, IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO MOVE IT IN THAT DIRECTION. I WON'T WANT TO PUT A TIME FRAME ON IT. >> GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION. KANE, THANKS. >> AND THAT IS SENATOR CHRIS DODD WRAPPING UP. HE SAYS FIXING THE HEALTH CARE PROBLEM -- >> NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM CONGRESSMAN DENNIS KUCINICH. THANK YOU. >> GOOD AFTERNOON. [APPLAUSE] IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE WITH YOU. AND AS I'M LISTENING TO THIS DISCUSSION TODAY, IT REMINDS ME THAT YOU ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO INSIST THAT AMERICA RECONNECT WITH ITS GREATNESS AND ITS GOODNESS. YESTERDAY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AMERICANS WERE TOLD THAT WE CAN'T HAVE PEACE, WE HAVE TO KEEP A WAR GOING FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO IN ORDER TO HAVE PEACE. I VOTED AGAINST THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE A NEW DIRECTION WHICH SAY IFS YOU WANT PEACE, YOU VOTE FOR PEACE, AND YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR POSSESSION. WE'RE BEING TOLD IN THIS STATE AND OTHER POLICE STATIONS THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE KINDERGARTEN CARE OR UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN CARE, AND YET WHEN YOU ACCEPT THAT, THEN YOU DON'T GET IT. EFFORTS ARE MADE TO JUST CUT SHORT A MOVEMENT. TODAY AT THIS FORUM, THE SUBMESSAGE IS THAT YOU CAN'T BREAK THE HOLD THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE. NOT A SINGLE CANDIDATE UP HERE HAS CHALLENGED THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND THAT IS INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE HOLDING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HOSTAGE AND FORCING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS INTO POVERTY WITH UNCONSCIONABLE PREMIUM, CO-PAYS, DEDUCTIBLES. [APPLAUSE] SO I ASK YOU, IS IT CONSONANT WITH AMERICA'S GREATNESS THAT CANDIDATES STEP AWAY FROM THE ONE SOLUTION THAT COULD CHANGE IT ALL? A NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE, BUT HR676, A BILL THAT I'VE INTRODUCED IN A NUMBER OF CONGRESSES, THE CONYERS/KUCINICH BILL, ACTUALLY ESTABLISHES MEDICARE FOR ALL. A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM, AND IT'S A NOT FOR PROFIT SYSTEM. IT'S TIME WE ENDED THIS THOUGHT THAT HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. IT IS A BASIC RIGHT, AND IT'S TIME WE ENDED THE CONTROL THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE NOT ONLY OVER HEALTH CARE BUT OVER OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] THINK FOR A MOMENT IF LINCOLN HAD DECIDED, WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH RESISTANCE TO THIS IDEA OF EMANCIPATION. THINK IF THE SUFFRAGE ETS HAD DECIDEED, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T TAKE ON THESE MEN WHO ARE DETERMINED NOT TO INCLUDE WOMEN IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. WHAT IF MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD SAID, YOU KNOW, WE CAN ONLY PUSH SO FAR FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, OR IN CEASE STAR CHAVEZ HAD SAID NO PUEDE? WHAT IF WE BUY INTO THIS LOGIC THAT SAYS WE CAN'T HAVE PEACE? WE'RINGBEING TOLD TO BUY INTO A VIEW OF THE WORLD THAT SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES RUN THE SYSTEM, WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL WORK OUT COMPETITION BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. WHERE'S OUR CALL FOR GREATNESS? WHAT IF FDR HAD SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T REALLY DO THE NEW DEAL. I'M TALKING ABOUT A REAL DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A. UNIVERSE AGO, SINGLE-PAYER, NOT FOR PROFIT, MEDICARE FOR ALL, AND IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE WITH YOU TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S ALREADY IN LEGISLATIVE FORM. 62 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE SIGNED ON TO BILL. OVER 14,000 PHYSICIANS HAVE SIGNED ON TO THE BILL, THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR A PLAN JUST LIKE IT, THE SENATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ENDORSED IT THE OTHER DAY, THE LEGISLATURE IN KANSAS PUT THEIR NAME ON IT AND ENDORSED THE IDEA. WE CAN DO THIS. YES, WE CAN, BREAK THE HOLD OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND LIFT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. THAT'S WHAT MY PRESIDENCY IS GOING TO BE ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. SO LET'S TALK. >> SURE. >> LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION. >> WELL, CONGRESSMAN, TOUGH FIRST ADVOCATE WE'VE HEARD TODAY OF A SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ESSENTIALLY MEDICARE FOR EVERYBODY. HOWEVER, THE LAST TIME, MY UNDERSTANDING IS, THAT IT WAS ON THE BALLOT WAS IN OREGON, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, IF NOT -- EXCEPT FOR VERMONT PROBABLY THE MOST LIBERAL STATE IN THE COUNTRY ON THESE ISSUES, AND IT DIDN'T PASS. WHERE DO YOU FIND THE POLITICAL WILL FOR A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM? >> I TRAVEL THIS COUNTRY IN THE LAST ELECTION, CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT HEALTH CARE IS THE ONE ISSUE THAT UNITES EVERYONE. WHERE DOES THE SUPPORT COME? FOR A NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM? IT COMES FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, BUT IT'S WAITING FOR A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEAD THE WAY, AND I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT. HR676 IS THE VEHICLE. NOW, HOW CAN YOU BREAK THE HOLD THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE, BECAUSE, LET'S FACE IT, IN OREGON THEY PUMPED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO TRY TO DEFEAT THE INITIATIVE. THIS IS REALLY SIMPLE. YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T HAVE STRINGS ATTACHED, SOMEONE WHO IS READY TO CON FRONT THESE INSURANCE INDUSTRIES, SOMEONE WHO ISN'T OWNED BY THE INTEREST. RIGHT NOW IN WALL STREET THESE HEDGE FUNDS ARE COMING TOGETHER POURING MILLIONS INTO THE CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT. WE'RE LOOKING AT A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU THE WORDS YOU WANT TO HEAR, BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SPECIFICS IN A PLAN, THEY'RE NOT DEVELOPING IT. WHY CAN I DO IT? SIMPLY, I HAVE NO STRINGS ATTACHED. I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS 40 YEARS. I'VE BEEN A COUNCILMAN, A CLERK OF COURT A MAJOR, I'M KNOWN FOR HAVING INTEGRITY AND A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE A STAND, AND FOR CHANGING THE OUTCOME WHEN OTHERS SAY IT CAN'T BE DONE. THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT I CALL UPON YOU AND THE SEIU AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SAY LET'S JOIN THIS MOVEMENT THAT ALREADY EXISTS, CALL UPON THE POWER OF OUR HEARTS AND OUR INTE LEX. WHAT ARE THE ANIMATING FORCES? HOW'S THIS: HALF OF THE BANKRUPTCY IS IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW ARE DIRECTLY CONNECT TODAY PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS, AND OF THAT AMOUNT, 75% OF THE PEOPLE ARE WORKING. HAVE JOBS, PEOPLE'S WHOLE LIVES ARE ON THE LINE HERE. WILL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BE GIVE GIVEN THE CHOICE? THIS ISN'T ""AMERICAN IDOL"" HERE. I MEAN, REALLY. I COULD COME UP HERE AND DO A LITTLE DANCE ABOUT, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES. OH, REALLY? ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE AWAY THEIR PROFITS? ARE YOU GOING TO REMOVE THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? 31% OF THE MONEY THAT'S IN THE SYSTEM NOW OF $2.2 TRILLION A YEAR GOES FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE FOR-PROFIT SYSTEM. IF WE TAKE THAT MONEY AWAY FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND USE IT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WELL, GUESS WHAT? WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR VISION CARE, DENTAL CARE, MENTAL HEALTH, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, AND LONG-TERM CARE. I'M GOING TO CALL ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHT. HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, NOT AS A PRIVILEGE. [APPLAUSE] >> WELL, CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE AN E-MAIL QUESTION FROM JAMES IN PATTERSON, CALIFORNIA, WHO WANTS TO KNOW WHY ARE HEALTH CARE COSTS GOING UP SO MUCH, AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP THESE INCREASES? COULD I JUST ADD A QUESTION TO THAT? >> OF COURSE. >> BECAUSE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM, PEOPLE SAY THE CONSEQUENCE OF TRYING TO CONTAIN COSTS IN A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM WOULD ULTIMATELY BE RATIONING. SO COULD YOU TAKE US THROUGH, FIRST, HOW A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM WOULD ADDRESS COSTS, AND ALSO WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THESE SORTS OF CONCERN THAT IS PEOPLE RAISE ABOUT IT? >> YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT THIS, NOW, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHEN THEY LOOK AT A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM, A NOT FOR PROFIT SYSTEM, THEY'LL SAY, MY GOD, YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH RATIONING. WHAT DO WE HAVE NOW? 46 MILLION AMERICANS DON'T EVEN HAVE COVERAGE. TALK ABOUT RATIONING? THEY'RE NOT EVEN IN THE LINE. OKAY? GIVE ME MY PORTION. ANOTHER 50 MILLION PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY COVERAGE, ARE UNDERINSURED, AND THE REST ARE PAYING THESE HIGH PREMIUMS CONSCIOUS-PAYS, AND DEDUCTIBLE TES. WE'VE GOT TO WREAK THE HOLD THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS PLAN THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT COVERS EVERYONE. HOW DO YOU REDUCE COSTS? LESS LOOK AT THE COSTS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. CORPORATE PROFITS, STOCK OPTIONS, EXECUTIVE SALARIES, ADVERTISING, MARKETING, THE COST OF PAPER WORK, ALL THIS TAKES ABOUT 31% OUT OF THE HEALTH CARE DOLLAR. NOW, WHAT DOES ALL THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE? ZERO. ZIP. THAD DA. I'M TALKING ABOUT CREATING A SYSTEM WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS SIMILAR TO THAT IN EVERY OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD. WE TAKE THE PROFIT OUT OF MEDICINE. HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, IT IS NOT A PRIVILEGE, SO HOW DO WE CONTROL COSTS? BY HAVING EVERYONE IN THE SAME POOL, EVERYONE, HAVING EVERYONE COVERED, AND HAVING THE BENEFITS BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WHATEVER THEIR INCOME, NO MEANS TESTING, AND BY CREATING A MOVEMENT. NOW, I WANT TO ADD SOMETHING TO AN EARLIER QUESTION YOU RAISED, AND THAT IS THAT -- AND, YOU KNOW, MY GOOD FRIEND SENATOR EDWARDS WHO HE AND I CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER FOUR YEARS AGO, HE RAISED THIS QUESTION, WHICH IS A VERY, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS THE QUESTION IN WASHINGTON. IT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE TO TAKE THIS PLAN FOR NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE. SENATOR CLINTON TALKED ABOUT INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT DOESN'T REALLY GET TO THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE, WHO CONTROLS HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA. SENATOR OBAMA'S STILL DEVELOPING HIS PLAN. THIS PLAN THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, I CO-AUTHORED THIS PLAN. I'M ONE OF THE ONE WHO IS WROTE THE PLAN. I KNOW THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS SET UP. THE AREA THAT I FLEPT CLEVELAND, PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THE DOCTOR BILLS. AND SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IT ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO S WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND THE WILLINGNESS TO TAKE A STAND AND CAN REACH OUT TO THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THE AMERICAN SCHEME CALL FORTH OUR GREAT TONS SAY WE'RE GOING CHANGE THIS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TRAPPED BY THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO GIVE US DIMINISHING RETURNS, WHO INSIST ON HIGHER PREMIUMS CONSCIOUS-PAYS, AND DEDUCTIBLES. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. CONGRESSMAN, YOU'RE KIND OF AN URBAN KIND OF GUY, AND ASHLEY OS BORN WHO IS A LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSE IN EL COA, WHICH IS A RURAL COUNTY IN NORTHERN NEVADA A QUESTION FOR YOU ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD ADDRESS CONCERNS IN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HER SITUATION. >> GOOD MORNING. AS YOU KNOW MY NAME'S ASHLEY OS BORN, AND I'M A LABOR NURSE IN NEVADA A RURAL AREA UP IN NORTH EASTERN NEVADA. COMMONLY I SEE MOMS COME IN TO MY DEPARTMENT WITH PREGNANCY-INDUCED, SEVERE PREGNANCY-INDUCED HEALTH CARE ISSUES THAT COULD BE ELIMINATED OR CAUGHT EARLY WITH PRENATAL CARE. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE UNABLE TO GET THAT. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS ON IMPROVING HEALTH CARE IN THE RURAL AREA IN THE U.S.? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THIS PLAN COVERS EVERYONE. AND RURAL AS WELL AS URBAN AREAS ALIKE. RURAL AREAS TEND TO BE UNDERSERVED. I'M LOOKING ALSO AT CREATING AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, WHICH WOULD BUILD HOSPITALS IN RURAL AREAS. AND RURAL PEOPLE WOULD THEN HAVE ACCESS, BECAUSE ACCESS IS THE HUGE QUESTION IN RURAL AREAS, AND WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT WOMENNINGBEING ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED, THIS SYSTEM, PRENATAL CARE, POSTTHAT ITAL CARE. THIS SYSTEM OF NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE DOESN'T TRY TO STOP WOMEN FROM GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE THERE'S AN INSURANCE AGENT TELLING A DOCTOR, YOU KNOW, AN OBGYN YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT. YOU'RE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH. THIS SYSTEM WILL MEET THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'RE BEING TOLD WE JUST CAN'T HAVE THOSE NEEDS MET. WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING DIFFERENTLY. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> THANKS, AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO A PUBLIC HEALTH STUDENT HERE AT UNLV, MEGAN McCORPS MACK WHO RAISES A PERTINENT POINT. I MEAN, IF THERE'S ANY PLACE WHERE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN OUTCOMES, IT'S IN MECHANIC. MEGAN? >> HELLO, RIGHT HERE. I'M A JUNIOR AT UNLV HERE. WE'RE SPENDING AN INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ON HEALTH CARE WHILE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE POOR OUTCOMES. THOSE COUNTRIES WHO ARE ALLOCATING A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR GDP TOWARDS HEALTH CARE. HOW DOES AMERICA PLAN TO STAY GLOBALLY PETTIVE WITH INCREASING HEALTH CARE COSTS? >> THAT IS A KEY QUESTION. IN MY OWN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WE HAVE AUTO PLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN THREATENED BECAUSE THE HIGH COST 06 HEALTH CARE IS CAUSING FORD AND GM TO PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF HEALTH CARE. NOW CANDAY, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS A MUST'VE STRONGER INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR THEIR PEOPLE. THIS PLAN THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO HELP AMERICAN BUSINESS. IT'S GOING TO STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY, IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HOLD ON TO MORE MUFNLT MANY FAMILIES ARE SPENDING IN EXCESSOVER $10,000 A YEAR FOR HEALTH CARE. WITH THIS PLAN ONLY A FRACTION OF THE MONEY THAT IS BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW WOULD HAVE TO BE PART OF THE FINANCING OF THE SYSTEM. I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW THAT 60% RIGHT NOW OF THE MONEY THAT'S IN HEALTH CARE IS SPENT BY THE GOVERNMENT? THE GOVERNMENT HAS 60% OF THE SPENDING RIGHT NOW. IF YO ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, IF YOU PURCHASE BULK PURCHASE OF DRUGS JUST THE WAY VETERANS DO, YOU START TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY THAT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE, AND THAT IS A MAJOR HELP FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND LARGE BUSINESSES ALIKE. THIS PATCHWORK PROPOSAL THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN HERE TODAY BY OTHER CANDIDATES LOCKS US INTO INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO THEN TAKE THEIR POUND OF FLESH AND GENERALLY IT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN BUDGETS. I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT MOST AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE MECHANIC SYSTEM IS SET UP. PEOPLE THAT ARE AWARE THAT IF THEY HAVE AN ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY, IT COULD WIPE THEM OUT. YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE HAVE TO LOSE THEIR HOME IN ORDER TO INSURE THE HEALTH OF A LOVED ONE? WHY SHOULD SOMEONE NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE LONG-TERM CARE THEY NEED FOR A LOVED ONE OR HAVE TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE TO GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED FOR FOR A LIFETIME IN ORDER TO GET THE LONG-TERM CARE YOU NEED? WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A REAL TRANSFORMATION. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THAT, BUT THEY NEED SOMEONE TO BE NOT JUST THE MESSENGER, BUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THIS ISSUE, AND IS READY TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT. YES, WE CAN IMPROVE OUR ECONOMY AND SAVE OUR BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL, AND I'M DEDICATED TO DO THAT, AND I'M ABLE TO DO IT TOO. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN. EARLIER SENATOR EDWARDS POINTED OUT THAT THERETO A SINGLE-PAYER, MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION BUILT INTO HIS PLAN. AND IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE COULD CONSIDER IN MAKING THEIR HEALTH CARE CHOICES, AND HE RAISED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF THAT WERE OUT THERE AS AN OPTION AND PEOPLE STARTED CHOOSING IT AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY REALLY LIKED IT, THAT THE COUNTRY COULD ALMOST, YOU KNOW, EVOLVE TOWARD A SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM. DO YOU SEE THIS AS A REAL SCENARIO GIVEN THE ORE INTERESTS THAT ARE OUT THERE? OR DO YOU THINK THAT, IN FACT, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO SORT OF COME DOWN IN ONE FELL SWOOP IF IT'S EVER GOING TO HAPPEN? >> WELL, YOU JUST ANSWERED THE QUESTION, AND THAT IS IF YOU HAVE COMPETITION BETWEEN INSURANCE COMPANIES, EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. THAT DOESN'T DRIVE COSTS, IT DRIVES UP PROFITS. THAT'S THE FACT. IF YAW SAY, WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHOICE, EITHER BE ON A PRIVATE PLAN OR BE WITH THE GOVERNMENT, WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE PRIVATE COMPANIES START CHERRY PICKING THE BEST, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE IN THE BEST HEALTH AND THEN YOU END UP WITH WHAT'S CALLED ADVERSE SELECTION, THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST MEDICALLY COMPROMISED END UP ON PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PAYING FOR. AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM STARTS TO GO DOWN. YOU END UP IN AN INSURANCE DEATH SPIRAL, WHAT IT'S CALLED IN THE INDUSTRY. THINK ABOUT IT, CANDIDATES ARE UP HERE ADVOCATING THAT GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I MEAN, DIDN'T WE HAVE ENOUGH OF SUBSIDIZING THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WITH THAT PHONY MEDICARE D PROGRAM THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD? HOW ARE WE ANY DIFFERENT AS DEMOCRATS? THINK ABOUT THAT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, OH, EVERYBODY'S FOR IT IT'S RESONANT WITH THAT FELLA IN THE MUSIC MAN WHO SAYS THERE'S TROUBLE IN RIVER CITY. UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, YOU KNOW WHAT? EVEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. ESPECIALLY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IF THE GOVERNMENT'S SUBSIDIZING THEM WHAT A DEAL THAT IS FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT WHAT A ROTTEN DEAL IT IS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE, GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THE PICTURE. HEALTH CARE IS NOT A PRIVILEGE, IT IS A RIGHT, AND IT IS A HUMAN RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, RIGHT. I MEAN, COME ON. YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T FALL OFF A CHRISTMAS TREE. YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BE INVOLVED IN STRAIGHT TALK STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER, AND YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T HAVE A KEY IN THE BACK BEING WOUND UP BY SPECIAL INTERESTS TO COME BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TELL THEM WATCH THE INTERESTS WANT. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, AND I'M READY TO TAKE THAT MESSAGE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I'D LIKE YOUR HELP IN DOING IT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE FOUR SECONDS LEFT. BUZZER SHOT, YOU WANT NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE, I'M THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN DELIVER. CUSHION NICHE.U.S. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CONGRESSMAN. >> AND THAT IS DENNIS KUCINICH GETTING AN ENTHUSIASTIC SENDOFF CALLING FOR A NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE U.S. >> NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL CANDIDATE OF THE DAY, FORMER ALASKA SENATOR MIKE GRAVEL. >> PLEASURE MEETING YOU. HI, ALL. I JUST WANT TO GIVE MY CONDOLENCES TO ALL OF YOU WHO REALIZE THAT SOMETHING SAD HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. THE REBELS LOTS BY FOUR POINTS. [APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ANDY IS SITTING OVER THERE, OKAY, ANDY, YOU SPEAK GOOD ENGLISH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THESE CANDIDATES DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME HERE. THAT'S BETTER THAN WHAT CNN IS GOING TO DO TO ME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BY CENSORING MY VOICE. BUT LET ME SAY THAT ANDY POINTED OUT ONE THING RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, AND THAT IS WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM, AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOUR TIME. YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO, AND BEV HEARD A LOT OF ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES AND DEEP EMOTIONS ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION. THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT WE'VE SADDLED THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH CARRYING IT. AND YOU CAN'T DO IT, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO COST YOU YOUR JOBS, IT'S GOING TO DAMAGE YOU INTERNATIONALLY. CARE REP WAS ELUDING TO IT. HISTORICAL ACCIDENT N A SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN WAGE WERE FROZEN, THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD GET PEOPLE TO ROOMINTO YOUR COMPANY AND WORK WAS TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. THE WAR'S OVER, WE DON'T HAVE ANY FREEZE ON WAGES, SO WE DON'T NEED THAT SYSTEM TO GO AHEAD AND CARRY, AND IF YOU HEARD ALL OF THE PLANS, THEY ESSENTIALLY, EXCEPT FOR DENNIS'S, THEY WERE ALL INVOLVING EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. THAT IS A NONSTARTER, AND IT'S A BAND-AID THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. NOW, WHAT IS, WHAT CAN WE DO? WELL, WE CAN REAL SIMPLE, WE CAN TURN AROUND AND SAY LET US HAVE A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THAT ESTABLISHES EQUALITY AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE NAME OF IT. IT'S CALLED THE UNIVERSE AGO, SINGLE-PAYER, I MEAN ALL AMERICANS PAY FOR IT REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEMS YOU HAVE NOW OR THE SYSTEMS YOU'RE GOING TO GET. HEALTH CARE VENNTURE, VOUCHER PLAN. UNDER THE PLAN WE WOULD ISSUE VOUCHERS TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN AND THE VOACHERS, YOU DON'T PAY FOR THEM, THEY'RE ISSUED TO YOU. AND YOU SIGN UP EVERY YEAR FOR THEM. AND THEY'LL HAVE A VERY MODEST CO-PAY, A VERY MODEST DEDUCTIBLE, BLUE THAT'S IT. EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME PRODUCT. UNIVERSEALLY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THEN IF YOU WANT MORE THAN THE PRODUCT YOU'VE GOT, YOU PAY FOR IT. THERE'S NO IMAGINE NICK THIS WHOLE PROCESS. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PAY, YOU KNOW WHO PAYS? IT'S THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. PARTICULARLY UNDER OUR PRESENT SYSTEM. AND SO TO WANT TO TRASH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND TRASH OUR TAX SYSTEM, WHICH IS ALREADY CORRUPT, WITH GREATER CORRUPTION AS A WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS A NONSTARTER. WHEN THEY TELL YOU ABOUT, OH, I'VE DONE THIS, DONE THAT, KEEP IN MIND HARRY TRUMAN WAS THE FIRST TO RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH THE DEMOCRATS, AND THEY DIDN'T DO IT. AND WE HAVEN'T DONE IT SINCE. AND SO IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BAND-AID, ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER. NOW, WITH THESE VOUCHERS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE CHOICE. CHOICE OF DOCTORS, CHOICE OF HOSPITALS, FREE CHOICE. NOW, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ALSO HAVE A CHOICE OF MAYBE NO MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX PLANS, INSURANCE PLANS. NOW, I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS WITH THE PREDATOR ACTIVITIES UNDER OUR PRESENT MERCANTILE SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR LOBBYISTS, 30,000 OF THEM IN WASHINGTON, GO OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR CLIENTS. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME CHANGES MAYBE IN THE FUTURE. IT DEPENDS ON HOW THIS IS ENACTED INTO LAW. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENACTED BY THE CONGRESS. DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH ON THAT. PLEASE, NEVER WILL HAPPEN. FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT THERE'S TOO MANY INTERESTS. 30,000 LOBBYISTS. WHO DO YOU THINK'S BUNDLING ALL THESE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES? YOU THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE HOLY TRINITY? MY GOD, IT'S COMING FROM VITAL SPECIAL INTERESTS WHETHER THEY'RE FOR DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE FACED WITH. SO NOW YOU CAN HAVE A VOUCHER. YOU'VE GOT THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE. YOU'VE GOT THE FLEE.COM OF CHOSE OF PLANS, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A PUBLIC PLAN IF WE DON'T SEE THE INDUSTRY R INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SHAPING UP. SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADMINISTER IT? LET'S HAVE LIKE THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. LET'S HAVE A CENTRAL BODY WITH REGIONAL BOARDS THAT THEY WOULD THEN DEFINE WHAT THE VARIOUS VOUCHERS ARE FOR. AND THE VOUCHERS ARE SET UP FOR RISK. ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NOT ON A CORRECTIVE THIS FITS ALL. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE A COST OF MORE THAN $3,000. WHEN YOU'RE MY AGE, IT COULD BE $150,000-$180,000 IN ONE YEAR WHICH IS WHAT I GOT HIT WITH, AND I WENT BANKRUPT AS A RESULT OF THAT. I KNOW THIS SYSTEM. I GET ME MIDS FROM THE VA, AND I GET THE REST FROM MEDICARE. SO I KNOW THE SYSTEM UP FRONT AND PERSONAL. AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOMEBODY I MET IN IOWA WHO WAS CRYING ON MY SHOULDER. [APPLAUSE] LET ME POINT OUT TO YOU, LET ME POINT OUT TO YOU SO WHAT ARE HAPPEN, I'M TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- OR THEY SAY ELECTRONIC RECORDS. HELL, THAT'S NOTHING. WE HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ENTIRE HISTORY COMPUTERIZED AND EVERY PENNY THAT'S SPENT ON YOUR HEALTH CARE COMPUTERIZED ALL THE TIME SO THAT WHEN WE'RE REALLY DESIGNING NEXT YEAR, WE'RE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND PROJECT, OH, YOU SPENT $3,000, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A VOUCHER FOR $3,000 NEXT YEAR. SUPPOSING YOU'VE GOT COLON CANCER AND IT'S GOING TO COST YOU $150,000 NEXT YEAR, THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SIZE OF YOUR VOUCHER. YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE DYNAMICS OF THIS. AND BY PUTTING IN WITH ONLY HAVING FIVE OR SIX PLANS, AND THE PLANS WE DETERMINE. AND THERE'LL BE NO LEMON DROPPING. THERE'LL BE NO, WELL, YOU DON'T QUALIFY, YOU'VE GOT A PREEXISTING CONDITION. THAT IS HISTORY UNDER THIS PLAN. AND SO THIS PLAN CAN WORK. ALL WE NEED TO DO, AND THEY SAY, OH, WEAVER GOT TO BRING THE PEOPLE IN. MY GOD BRING THE PEOPLE N. THEY'RE NOT BRINGING THE PEOPLE ANYWHERE. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO CREATE AN ATTITUDE OF, MY GOD, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING GREAT WITH THE PEOPLE. HELL, THE PEOPLE ARE NOT EMPOWERED TO DO ANYTHING. IN THE UNITED STATES MORE THAN HALF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MAKE LAWS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL? IF YOU DID, THEN OF COURSE, YOU COULD DECIDE WHAT IS THE HEALTH PLAN YOU WANT TO HAVE OR IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO PUT UP WITH THE BAND-AIDS WE'RE EXPERIENCING. HOW ARE WE GOING TO PAY FOR MY HEALTH CARE ANY WANT TO THANK MY ADVISERS, BOTH EXPERTS IN THE FIELD WHO HAVE BEEN ADVISING ME ON IT. THEY MAY BE ASHAMED AT THE WAY I PRESENT IT, BUT I THINK NOT. I THINK NOT. AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IF WE EMPOWER YOU, THEN YOU COULD MAKE THE DECISION AND NOT TRY TO -- STOP AND THINK WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. THEY'RE SAYING WE WANT YOU TO USE THE GOVERNMENT FOR YOUR BENEFIT. OKAY? WHY TOO FAR TO DO THAT? WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT DIRECTLY? YOU CAN, AND THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT. GO TO GRAVEL 08.U.S., AND YOU'LL SEE THE PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR. [APPLAUSE] IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PLAN THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING, IF I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT, HAS SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE SINGLE PAIR BUT ALSO SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. IT'S NOT A SORT OF TRADITIONAL PURE SINGLE-PAYER PLAN, AND YOU DESCRIBE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEVER COME FROM CONGRESS. SO COULD YOU DESCRIBE, AGAIN, THIS PROCESS BY WHICH -- WHAT KIND OF PROCESS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HERE? >> I'M TALKING ABOUT USING THE NATIONAL NICHE TI. FIRST, FOR THIS TO HAPPEN, AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE 10 YEARS FROM NOW, 15 YEARS FROM NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PROBLEM GETTING WORSE. IT'S GETTING WORSE ALL THE TIME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE CONGRESS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS? LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE LITERALLY BANKRUPT, AND NOBODY PAYS ANY ATTENTION TO IT. WE'VE GONE TO THESE CRAZY WARS. WE HAVE A NATION THAT'S CONTROLLED BY THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX THAT DICTATES WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUR LIVES, AND THE AMERICANS ARE JUST WHISTLING WALKING THROUGH THE CEMETERY. I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. >> THIS NATIONAL INITIATIVE, HOW DOES IT WORK? IT STARTS AS A PETITION? IT STARTS AS WHAT. >> I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS, BUT WHAWNS I'VE DONE IS I'VE COPIED THE PROCEDURES THAT I USED IN THE CONGRESS AND EVERY ELECTIVE BODY IN THE WORLD, AND I'VE PUT THEM INTO A LAW CALLED THE NATIONAL BALLOT INITIATIVE, AND THAT IS TO EQUIP EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO COME INTO THE OPERATION OF GOVERNMENT AS LAW MAKERS AND PARTNERS WITH THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. NOW, THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY. THIS IS OUT OF THE BOX. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? WE TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ISN'T THAT REVOLUTIONARY? WE TRUST THE PEOPLE. RATHER THAN THE OTHER POLITICIAN THAT IS SAY TRUST ME, I'LL GET ELECTED AND I'LL DO A JOB FOR YOU. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU, CAN'T BE DONE THAT WAY, AND WE HAVE HISTORIC PRECEDENT TO SHOW IT. IF THAT DOESN'T CONVINCE YOU THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE RIGHT DIRECTION ELECTING VARIOUS PERSONALITIES PRESIDENT,THE CHANGE LIES WITH YOU. NOT THE LEADERSHIP. THE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN SCREWING UP BY THE NUMBERS FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS. HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH YET? PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] >> WELL, SENATOR, THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT I HAD IN MY MIND ABOUT THIS, AND IT'S ADDRESSED MY BUN OF OUR QUESTIONERS IN THE AUDIENCE, AND INTERESTINGLY AT THIS VERY MOMENT A QUESTION OVER E-MAIL POPPED UP THAT ADDRESSED THE SAME ISSUE. YOU CRIEB THESE VOUCHERS AS ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS YOU HAVE. YOU NEED A HEART BYPASS, YOU GET A VOUCHER THAT COULD COVER IT. BUT MICHELLE IN IOWA ASKS HOW WOULD YOU INCREASE THE ROLE OF PREVENTION IN THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, AND I'D LIKE TO TURN TO BECKY -- WHO'S AN RN AT UH VALLEY HOSPITAL, ARE YOU HERE, BECKY? >> I AM HERE. I HAVE BEEN A NURSE FOR 37 YEARS, AND I HAVE SEEN PATIENTS COME IN TO THE HOSPITAL WITH MEDICAL PROBLEMS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF A DOCTOR HAD BEEN, HAD SEEN THIS PATIENT EARLY ON. AS PRESIDENT, HOW WILL YOU INSURE THAT MORE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE AND WELLNESS CARE IS PROVIDED NATIONWIDE? >> FIRST OFF, THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN HIS LEADERSHIP CAPACITY OR HER LEADERSHIP CAPACITY, AND THAT IS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. TO REALLY ENERGIZE PEOPLE TO EXERCISE. NOW, PEOPLE SAY AT MY AGE, YOU KNOW, I'M A GOOD EXAMPLE. I'VE HAD TWO MAJOR OPERATIONS, WELL, SEVERAL MAJOR OPERATIONS, BUT I'M IN GOOD SHAPE BECAUSE I EXERCISE. I TRY TO EAT THE RIGHT FOODS, AND SO I HAD A LADY ON THE PLANE SHOW ME THAT SHE COULD HAVE GOT THIS JUNK BAR FOR 50 CENTS, BUT THEY WERE ASKING FOR $1.25 FOR THE APPLE THAT SHE WAS HOLDING UP ABOUT TO EAT. DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF WHAT'S GOING ON? I MEAN, WE'RE ALL PATRIOTIC WHETHER IT'S IN BUSINESS OR LABOR, WE'RE ALL PATRIOTIC, BUT WE NEED A LEADERSHIP THAT SET ACETONE TO DEMAND FROM US THE BEST THAT'S IN US. AND WE RECOGNIZE THESE PROBLEMS. WE KNOW THE PROBLEM OF OBESITY. I TRY TO DIET ALL THE TIME. SOMETIMES SUCCESSFULLY, SOMETIMES NOT SO SUCCESSFULLY. BUT WHEN ALL YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION IS JUNK FOOD, YOU'VE GOT O A PROBLEM, AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN BULLY. YOU CAN SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO REGULATE ALL THIS, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN KATRINA? YOU'VE HEARD THE JOKE, I'M FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. WELL, THAT DOESN'T WORK. THE GOVERNMENT'S A TOOL. THE PEOPLE CAN USE IT. BUT IF THE PEOPLE HAVE THE DIRECT POWER TO USE IT, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SEE GOVERNMENT AS A REAL TOOL. NOT THE TOOL YOU HAVE WHERE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS DETERMINE HOW THE TOOL OF GOVERNMENT IS HANDLED BY THE LOBBYISTS WHO DO THE BUNDLING TO PAY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR THEIR CAMPAIGNS TO MANIPULATE YOU TO VOTE FOR THEM. THAT'S THE POSITIVE THAT WE LIVE UNDER, AND THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT HAS TO CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] >> OKAY. NEXT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO -- PAFL WHO'S A JANITOR IN CLARK COUNTY. ARE YOU HERE? I APOLOGIZE, UNIT EVEN COME CLOSE. I'M HALF THE TIME NULLITY, SO I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. >> THAT'S ALL RIGHT. MY NAME IS -- PALE, AND I'M AN SCIU MEMBER, AND I WORK AS A JANITOR. I'M ALSO A PRIMARY CAREGIVER FOR MY 78-YEAR-OLD MOTHER. MY MOTHER HAS MEDICARE AND THE PROBLEM LIES IN THAT THE PROVIDERS WILL NOT USE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND TREATMENTS THAT WILL DIAGNOSE HER SOONER AND TREAT THE PROBLEM FASTER. QUESTION IS, SIR, WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR PROVIDING PREVENTIVE AND DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES IN HEALTH CARE FOR OUR SENIORS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND ALL AMERICANS? >> ONE OF THE FACETS OF THE PLAN WOULD BE TO KEEP IN PLACE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND PHASE THEM OUT OVER TIME. BECAUSE PLANS TO PUT EVERYBODY ON MED MEDICARE AREN'T GOING TO FLY FINANCIALLY AND JUST CAN'T BE MET. AND SO THEY CAN TELL YOU THEY CAN, BUT THEY CAN'T BE MET. WE ARE IN DEEP ECONOMIC DIFFICULTY AND IN DEBT. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SENIORS, THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE THESE HEALTH REGIONAL BOARDS WHERE N THAT REGION, THEY WILL BE DEFINING WHAT GOES INTO THE VARIOUS VOUCHERS. AND THEY'LL CHANGE EVERY YEAR DEPENDING UPON YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY AS YOU GET OLDER. AND WE KNOW IT COSTS LESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND IT COSTS MORE FOR OLD PEOPLE. THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE SITUATION. SO I DON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC TO TAKE CARE OF THE SENIORS. ALL I CAN SAY IS I CAN SET UP A STRUCTURE THAT WILL HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES WHERE THEY WILL HAVE A BETTER SAY, THEY'LL HAVE A BETTER SAY THAN THEY HAVE TODAY. 77 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE RETIRING IN THE NEXT 25 YEARS. THOSE ARE THE BABY BOOMERS. THAT'S TWICE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THE ADULT, THE SENIOR PEOPLE THAT EXIST TODAY. IF THERE'S A GROUP THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THE NATIONAL BALLOT INITIATIVE, IT'S GOING TO BE THE SENIORS BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE MORE CLOUT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY FEEL WILL ADDRESS THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT I WOULD OFFER TO YOU. NOT A MAGIC WAND FROM MIKE GRAVEL AS PRESIDENT, IT'S FROM THE PEOPLE BEING INVOLVED DIRECTLY WITH THE POWER TO MAKE LAWS ON POLICY ISSUE THAT IS AFFECT THEIR LIVES. THAT DOESN'T EXIST TODAY, AND THERE'S NOBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN THAT'S EVEN SUGGESTED THAT. THEY TALK ABOUT BIG CHANGES. THEY'RE COSMETIC CHANGES AND THEY'RE BAND-AIDS. >> COULD I ASK A FOLLOW-UP? I THINK IT'S TO THE PREMISE OF THE QUESTION IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY WHICH IS THAT HAVE YOU FOUND THIS IN YOUR OWN E APPEARANCE AS A PATIENT AND ALSO AS A POLICY MAKE THEY ARE ELDERLY PATIENTS IN PARTICULAR, THE MEDICAL SYSTEM DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME AGGRESSIVENESS AND THE SAME SORT OF CURIOSITY S. THAT SORT OF WHAT YOU WERE GREATING AT HERE IN TOOTERMS OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND THE KIND OF TREATMENT THAT ELDERLY PATIENTS RECEIVE? >> WELL, MAYBE I DIDN'T WANT ANSWER HER PRECISELY. DOCTORS DO A LOT OF TESTING TODAY TO COVER THEIR BACKSIDE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SUED. ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THESE REGIONAL BOARDS IS WE'RE GOING TO DO AWAY WITH WHAT WE SEE THAT THE ATTORNEYS LOVE, AND THAT IS TO GO SUE DOCTORS OR RAISE THE COSTS WHERE THEY CAN'T EVEN STAY IN BUSINESS. THE SAME THING WITH NURSES. THAT'S GOT TO GO. NOW, YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY THE TRIAL LAWYERS ARE POURING INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS? JUST ASK A COUPLE OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING THEIR BLOGGING. LOOK AT THAT DATA, THAT ANSWERS THE WHOLE QUESTION. SO WE CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING. YOU CANNOT HAVE EVERYTHING. AND YO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A BASIC PLAN THAT WILL COVER, AND THE WAY THE PLAN IS DESIGNED, IT WON'T RAISE COSTS BECAUSE THE 30% THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE PAPER COST, IF YOU TOOK THAT AND PUT IT INTO SOME REAL COST IN HEALTH CARE, YOU CAN COVER EVERYBODY WITHOUT RAISING ANY COSTS. BUT YOU DO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT. YOU CAN'T HAVE A BURP AND RUN TO THE DOCTOR. YOU'VE GOT -- WE'VE GOT TO BE RESPONSIBLE AS CITIZENS AND THAT GOES BACK TO THIS WHOLE PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. WE CHANGE THE CULTURE. THAT ITSELF WILL LOWER THE COST. BUT ALSO UNTIL WE ARE TOTALLY IN A NEW CULL ENOUGH THAT REGARD, WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME DISCIPLINE ON WHAT THE BASIC PACKAGE WILL BE, AND THAT IS A DECISION -- AND YOU WANT TO RAISE THE BASIC PACKAGE AND YOU'RE LAW MAKERS? WELL, PUT AN INITIATIVE UP, AND LET'S SAY WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE COST RATHER THAN 7% FOR THE BASIC PACKAGE, WE'RE GOING TO RAISE IT TO 10%. LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. THAT'S THE SLOGAN OF MY CAMPAIGN, LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. WHY SHOULD THE POLITICIANS BE ALSO ON THE -- IN THIS AREA, AND THEY KNOW IT ALL? WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN PRODUCE A DECENT PLAN? I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES THE FOLLOW-ON QUESTION. >> THANK YOU. WE HAVE ABOUT ONE MINUTE LEFT, AND SO I WANT TODAY ASK YOU YOUR SLOGAN LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FROM HERE ON OUT? YOU COME INTO THIS RACE WITHOUT A LOT OF NAME RECOGNITION, WITHOUT A LOT OF MONEY, WITHOUT A BIG ORGANIZATION. WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE? >> WELL, THE PROBLEM OF NOT A LOT OF MONEY CAN BE SOLVED BY THE PEOPLE WHO HEAR MY VOICE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE LOBBYISTS BUNDLING MONEY FOR ME. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GIVERRING THROUGH TOWER EXECUTIVES GIVING ME ANY MONEY. IT'S GOING TO BE IF MY VOICE CAN BE HEARD. AND I DON'T NEED THE $50 BILLION, $100 BILLION OR MILLION DOLLAR THAT IS THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND, ALL I NEED IS A MODICUM OF MONEY, AROUND $10 MILLION, AND I'LL WIN. BECAUSE I'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SAY THE SOLUTION IS WITH YOU, IT'S NOT WHERE THE LEADERS. AND IF I COULD BECOME PRESIDENT, AND LIGHTNING WILL HAVE TO STRIKE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING? LIGHTNING HAS INSTRUCT ALL THE TIME IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. ALL THE TIME. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN POLL POLITICS, AND I COULD BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] I COULD BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. AND IF YOU WORRY ABOUT MY AGE, DON'T. WE CAN GET A YOUNG MAN AS VICE PRESIDENT. OKAY? AND THERE'S A FEW AROUND. >> WELL, THANK YOU. >> I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR. I THINK ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN POLITICS IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO END TODAY'S SESSION. >> THANK YOU FOR",2015-11-07 17:22:28,2007-05-06,Manchester,New Hampshire

THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING I DO AND TRY TO GET A BIGGER FORCE IN THERE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF DARFUR. THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

I THINK I AM SUPPOSED TO BE READY. >> ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU SEE IS GOING TO BE -- AS WE GO ALONG AND WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE? >> I THINK PEOPLE WILL LOOK FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S RHETORIC TODAY MATCH IS NOT ONLY HIS RHETORIC BEFORE HIM BUT HIS RECORD BEFORE HIM AND ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL MY CANDIDACY IS ONE TO TAKE HOLD IN GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO MOVE TO THE TOP IS, WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT I'M NOT JUST SAYING THINGS NOW AND NOT BEING CONSERVATIVE AND PROLIFE IN FOR THE FAIR TEXT COMIC GETTING OUR TAXES FAIRER, THESE ARE NOT NEW THINGS. THESE ARE THINGS I'VE BEEN SAYING AND DOING AS A GOVERNOR FOR TEN AND HALF YEARS. I THINK PEOPLE KNOW THAT GOVERNORS RUN THINGS AND HAVE TO MAKE BALANCED BUDGETS WORK IN THE ONE THAT IN A PRESIDENT. SPEAK TOMORROW NIGHT THE DEBATE IN COLUMBIA, EVERYBODY IS ALL COMING IN. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS? >> I'M HOPING THEIR FORMAT WILL BE MORE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED WITH CANDIDATES EACH GETTING A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO RESPOND. THE FIRST DEBATE WAS MORE LIKE A GAME SHOW THAT AN HONEST DISCOURSE OF POLITICAL CANDIDATES AND I'M HOPING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO DELVE INTO ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GOT SOME POP CULTURE QUESTIONS THAT ARE RELEVANT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BUT THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES. WHAT DO WE DO NOT JUST ABOUT IRAQ BUT EDUCATION, ENVIRONMENT, ABOUT ENERGY RESOURCES IN THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT HOW TO KEEP JOBS IN AMERICA THAT WE'RE LOSING TO CHINA. THOSE ARE ISSUES WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING. I HOPE THAT FORUM WILL ENFORCE THAT OPPORTUNITY. >> ONE OTHER QUESTION, EDUCATION KIDS THE EDUCATION HAS GOT TO CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS, MEASURING, ACCOUNTABILITY. WE DID THAT IN ARKANSAS AND WITH SUCH DRAMATIC RESULTS. WHAT LOVE TO PUT THE RESULTS DURING MIKE TENANT AND A HALF YEARS AS GOVERNOR UP NEXT TO HILLARY'S WHEN HER YASMEN QUITTOR IN CHARGE OF EDUCATION. HE WOULD SEE A DIFFERENT BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO KIDS EVERY MINUTE TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE DUMB BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BORED STIFF. TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR KIDS TO TAKE A NAP WITH THEIR HEAD RESTING ON THE DESK. WE NEED AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES ON AWAKENING DOES KIDS TO WANT TO LEARN AS OPPOSED TO PERPETUAL AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF SCHOOLS. >> GOT IT. THANK YOU SIR. >> I APPRECIATE YOU COMING. >> NO PROBLEM. >> THIS IS THE EIGHT TEAMS RIGHT THERE. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU CAN THANKS FOR COMING TODAY. HI. JOE, PLEASE TO ME.

HOW ARE YOU FOLKS DOING? >> THIS IS MY WIFE, LORI. >> IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] >> WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SOME THOUGHTS ON EDUCATION, WHAT IS YOUR PLATFORM ON EDUCATION. >> WHEN I BECAME THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS I INHERITED A 20 YEAR COURT SYSTEM ON -- WE WERE ABLE TO GET IT RESOLVED. SOME OF THE THINGS WE DID WHICH PRECEDED NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, WE UNDERSTOOD WE HAD TO RAISE, NOT LOWER STANDARDS. YOU WILL NOT SEE IMPROVEMENT BY TAKING THE BEST OF ALL KUHL FROM 10 FEET OFF THE FLOOR AND SLOWING IT DOWN TO SIX. YOU MAKE IT SO CHALLENGING THAT YOU INCREASE THE SKILLS OF THOSE WHO COMPLETE THE GAME, SO WE RAISE OUR STANDARDS IN MATH AND LITERACY . WE STARTED WITH A PROGRAM CALLED SMART START, EXPANDED TO WHAT WE CALLED SMART STEP AND THE NEXT STEP WHICH WAS OUR HIGH SCHOOL. WE CREATED WHAT WE CALLED THE SMART CORE CURRICULUM AT THE HIGH-SCHOOL LEVEL. WE SAW A LOT OF KIDS BY THEIR SENIOR YEAR WHO DID NOT HAVE A LOT TO DO BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL OF THEIR REQUIREMENTS. WE UPPED THE ANTE. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARDER, NOT EASIER TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL AND YOUR SENIOR YEAR ONE BE YOUR EASIEST YEAR. IT GOT TO BE PREPARING YOU FOR YOUR NEXT LEVEL UP. WE HAVE SEEN THE MOST DRAMATIC UPTICK IN SCORES. OUR NASCENT LED THE NATION IN THE CHILDREN WHO TOOK THE EXAMS. EDUCATION, MAGAZINE THIS LAST JANUARY INDICATED THAT WE HAD ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, ONLY TO OTHER STATES -- I THINK MAYBE NORTH CAROLINA AND ONE OTHER STATE WHO HAD SIMILAR CHANGES IN TERMS OF ACTUAL STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND GENUINELY MEASURABLE TEST SCORE IMPROVEMENT. WHAT OF THE THINGS I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IN EDUCATION IS THAT IT IS AN OUTRAGE WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE DROPPING OUT, TO EVERY MAN IT. WHAT HAPPENS IS KIDS ARE NOT DUMB, NOT INCAPABLE OF LEARNING BUT MANY ARE BORED TO DEATH. NOT JUST FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE FACT WE'RE LOSING KIDS. THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU ARE LOSING AS A TAXPAYER. THE MOST EXPENSIVE SLEEP IN AMERICA TODAY HAPPENS IN THE TYPICAL SCHOOL CLASSROOM WHERE KIDS IS BORT DEBT. PART OF IT IS BECAUSE A CURRICULUM DOES NOT CHALLENGE AND SCHOOLS ARE SOMETIMES BUILT AROUND PERPETUATING THE INSTITUTION RATHER THAN ASKING WHAT MAKES THIS KID AWAKEN TO A SENSE OF LEARNING. ONE THING WE DID IN OUR STATE WAS TO INSIST EVERY CHILD HAVE A MUSIC AND ARTS EDUCATION WHICH CERTIFIED TEACHERS. IF YOU WANT TO PULL MY ROPE AND GET MY MOTOR POINT, LET ME TALK TO ABOUT WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ARTS EDUCATION FOR EVERY STUDENT BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DEVELOP THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES OF THE BRAIN, WE DON'T HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE HAVE AN INFORMATION DOWNLOAD. ALL WE'RE CREATING IS A DATA BASE FROM ONE KID TO THE NEXT THEN WE DON'T HAVE AN OPERATING SYSTEM. YOU CAN HAVE THE GREATEST COMPUTER IN THE WORLD WITH INCREDIBLE CAPACITY FOR DATA BUT IF IT DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD PROCESSOR, YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT WORTH TURNING ON. WE SOMEHOW THOUGHT THAT AN EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS ALL ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION OF DATA INTO THE CHILD'S HEAD. WHEN WE TAKE MUSIC AND ART PROGRAMS OUT, WE TAKE AWAY THE CREATIVE SIDE CAN WE TAKE FROM THEM THE PROCESSOR, THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT TELLS THEM WHY. IT BECOMES A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BALANCE AND EVERY STUDY SHOWS MUSIC EDUCATION WILL ENHANCE MATH, ACT SCORES, SATS COURSE. KIDS WILL DO BETTER IN GEOMETRY OF THE AHEAD ARTS BECAUSE THE CDC THING SPATIALLY. I COULD GO ON AND ON AND I OFTEN DO GIVEN TIRE SPEECHES JUST ON MUSIC AND ART. I TELL PEOPLE, IT IS NOT EXPENDABLE AND IT IS NOT EXTRANEOUS. IT IS ESSENTIAL. IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT EDUCATING A GENERATION OF KIDS WHO CAN BE COMPETITIVE AND CREATE THE KIND OF ECONOMY WHICH I BELIEVE THE FUTURE ECONOMY WILL BECOME A CREATIVE ECONOMY. YOU CANNOT DO THAT APART FROM MAKING SURE KIDS GROW UP NOT ONLY WITH AN APPRECIATION FOR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS BUT ALSO APPRECIATION OF THE PAINT BRUSH OR A DANCE STUDIO OR A PLAYSCRIPT OR MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, WHATEVER THEIR TALENT IS,. >> HOW YOU TRANSLATE THAT INTO THAT. >> I BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD FORCE -- I AM A TENTS AMENDMENT GUY. I THINK THE PRESIDENT USES THE BULLY PULPIT. THERE -- ONE OF WHICH AND THE ISSUE OF BRINGING DOWN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF IDP A OR OTHER KIDS WHO MIGHT SKEW THE RESULTS, AND THAT IS BEING WORKED ON AND I THINK RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY, NCLB SAID MUSIC AND ART ARE A PART OF THE CURRICULUM. A LOT OF PEOPLE BLAME NCLB FOR MUSIC AND ART PROGRAMS BEING CUT. TRUTHFULLY MUSIC AND ART ARE PART OF THAT CORE CURRICULUM FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THAT AND GIVE PRESIDENT BUSH CREDIT. THERE IS NOT YET A GOOD MEASURING TOOL FOR THE VALIDITY OF MANY OF THE MUSIC AND ART PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE DON'T MEASURE AND AT ACCOUNTABILITY DON'T NECESSARILY ESCALATE TO A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE. THERE ARE WAYS TO EVALUATE. WHAT WE DO IS MAKE SURE THAT STATES ARE NOT ONLY IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS BUT IN THE SAME WEIGHT WERE JUDGING THEM ON MATH, SCIENCE AND LITERACY PROGRAMS WILSON NEED TO INCLUDE AS PART OF THE EVALUATION HOW WELL THE TATOOING KID LET THEM TO SIGN THEIR CURRICULUM. AGAIN, THAT IS A STATE FUNCTION THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. THERE'S NO REASON THEY COULD NOT BE FEDERAL ROLE IN HELPING TO CREATE THE STANDARDS -- GIVING PEOPLE THE BENCHMARKS THEY CAN APPLY IN THE STATES FOR MUSIC AND ARTS PROGRAMS. THOSE ARE OUT THERE.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?198278-1/health-care-proposals,Health Care Proposals,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"HER REMARKS AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY ARE ABOUT 45 MINUTES. >> GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. THERE YOU GO. LET'S PRETEND THIS IS A BLACK CHURCH. I WANT A LITTLE ACTION. IT'S A PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU HERE AND IT'S A PLEASURE AS WELL TO WELCOME SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON BACK TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND AND COMES HERE REGULARLY. SENATOR CLINTON'S POSITIONS ON THE GREAT ISSUES OF THE DAY ARE CERTAINLY WELL KNOWN TO THIS GROUP, BUT WHAT WE MAY NOT KNOW AS WELL IS THAT SENATOR CLINTON IS TRULY A MEMBER OF THE G.W. FAMILY. NOT ONLY DOES SHE HOLD AN HONOR AREA DOCTORATE OF PUBLIC SERVICE FROM THIS VERY INSTITUTION, BUT SHE HAS ALSO ATTENDED AT LEAST ONE G.W. BASKETBALL GAME, AND THAT IS, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, ENTITLES HER TO LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP IN OUR ASSOCIATION. ON A PERSONAL NOTE, LET ME SAY THAT MY SON BEN WENT TO SECOND AREA SCHOOL WITH SENATOR CLINTON'S DAUGHTER. SO WE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND MANY PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION MEETINGS WITH THE CLINTONS. AND WE REMEMBER THEM WITH SOME AIF HE CAN SHON. IN FACT, THEY WERE A SOURCE OF SOME EMBARRASSMENT TO ME SINCE PRESIDENT CLINTON AND SENATOR CLINTON NEVER MISSED A MEETING, AND I DID. IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE DR. BECKER, THE C.E.O. AND MANAGER DIRECTOR OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. DR. BECKER IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ANESTHESIA AND SERVED AS ASSISTANT DEAN FOR CLINICAL AFFAIRS AT G.W. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCES. DR. BECKER GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO COMPLETE HIS RESIDENCEY INANCE THOLING AT THE GEORGE WASHINGTON MEDICAL CENTER WHERE HE LEARNED EVERYTHING HE NEEDED TO KNOW. TO CONTINUE THE FAMILY THEME, DR. BECKER HOLDS AN EXECUTIVE MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OUR FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, DR. RICHARD BECKER. [APPLAUSE] >> GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND WELCOME. IT IS INDEED MY PLEASURE AND HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE G.W. HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER AND UNIVERSITY TO WELCOME SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON TO OUR CAMPUS. SENATOR CLINTON, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE VISITED OUR CAMPUS. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, YOU CAME TO TALK ABOUT BREAST CANCER AWARENESS. IN A BIPARTISAN SPIRIT, YOU VISITED OUR HOSPITAL WITH SENATOR FRIST TO RECOGNIZE THE TECHNOLOGICAL BREAK THROUGH OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS AND ADVOCATE PATIENT ACCESS. THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER IN GOVERNMENT, YOU HAVE BEEN A VOICE FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM. YOU LED THE FIGHT FOR THE EARLY TREATMENT FOR H.I.V. ACT, WHICH EXPANDS ACCESS TO VITAL TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH H.I.V. YOU FOUGHT TO FULLY FUND THE RYAN WHITE CARE ACT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE LIVING WITH H.I.V. AND AIDS. YOU HELPED PASS LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE EXTRA FUNDING FOR THE FLU VACCINE AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO COMBAT DIABETES, AUTISM AND ASTHMA. YOU ARE LEADING THE FIGHT TO LOWER COSTS, WHICH ALSO REDUCES ERRORS AND IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND YOU ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN WRITING THE LGS THAT GUARANTEES NEW PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE TESTED FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS ADD UTILITIES. YOU ARE A TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL AMERICANS AND HAVE CHAMPIONSED EFFORTS TO END DISCRIMINATION BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE HEALTH CARE ARENA. TODAY, YOU ARE WITH US AGAIN TO ADDRESS A TOPIC THAT IS OF CONCERN NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF US WHO RUN HOSPITALS, BUT TO EACH AND EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH OUR DOOR. RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE INDEED THE PARAMOUNT ISSUES WE FACE. AS AN AUDIENCE OF THOSE WHO PROVIDE THE CARE, WE KNOW THAT LEADERSHIP ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES WILL BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OUR NATION IN A NEW CENTURY. WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT THESE TOPICS TO OUR UNIVERSITY. WE'RE OPEN FOR DISCUSSION TO HEALTH CARE REFORM IN AN ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT CAN TAKE PLACE WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND LEADERS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE BACK AT G.W. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS KIND INTRODUCTION, BUT HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE BEEN LEADING ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SO MANY OTHER ISSUES FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE KNOWN THEM, AND THAT GOES BACK MANY YEARS. AND WE SHARED AN EXPERIENCE OF OUR CHILDREN IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE WE BOTH SURVIVED. SO WE'RE GRATEFUL TO TELL THE TALE. I WANT TO THANK DR. WILLIAMS AND DR. BECKER. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE RUSS RAMSEY, THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD, DR. SCOTT AND THE C.E.O. OF THE MEDICAL FACULTY, STEVEN BADGER. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE BACK AT G.W. IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE HEALTH CARE COMMUNITY AND, OF COURSE, OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, AS I TRAVEL AROUND AMERICA, I HAVE TALKED WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR COUNTRY IS FACING, FROM ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ TO ENDING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL, FROM IMPROVING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM, TO REDUCING OUR DEFICIT. AND NO MATTER WHERE I GO AND WITH WHOM I TALK, WHETHER IT'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OR C.E.O.'S, DOCTORS, NURSES OR PATIENTS, I HEAR GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE CHRIS IS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, DECLINING COVERAGE AND SHORTCOMINGS IN CARE AND PREVENTION. I HAVE TANGLED WITH THIS ISSUE BEFORE, AND I'VE GOT THE SCARS TO SHOW FOR IT, BUT I LEARNED SOME VALUABLE LESSONS FROM THAT EXPERIENCE. ONE IS THAT WE CAN'T ACHIEVE REFORM WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION AND COMMITMENT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER CITIZENS WHO PAY FOR, DEPEND UPON AND ACTUALLY DELIVER HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I THINK WE FINALLY HAVE A RECOGNITION THAT EVERYONE SEES THERE IS AN ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE TO REIN COSTS. THERE IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO EXTEND COVERAGE TO ALL AMERICANS AND THERE IS A PRACTICAL NECESSITY TO PRO MET WELLNESS AND PREVENT ILLNESS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. I PLAN TO PUT THOSE LESSONS TO WORK TO INSURE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN HAS QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE. THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO MY APPROACH. FIRST, LOWERING COSTS FOR EVERYONE. SECOND, IMPROVING QUALITY FOR EVERYONE. THIRD, INSURING EVERYONE. TODAY, I WILL FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGE OF LOWERING COSTS. HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL. PREMIUMS HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED SINCE 2000, INCREASING FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN AVERAGE WAGES. EVERY DAY, PARENTS CHOOSE TWN PAYING THE PREMIUMS BETWEEN THEMSELVES OR THEIR CHILDREN. SHAL BUSINESSES WONDER HOW THEY WILL STAY AFLOAT WHEN THEIR HEALTH CARE COSTS EAT UP THEIR PROFITS YEAR AFTER YEAR. C.E.O.'S OF MAJOR AMERICAN COMPANIES WORRY ABOUT HOW THEY WILL SUCCEED IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WHEN THEY ARE COMPETING WITH FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT SPEND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ON HEALTH CARE. WE SPEND 16% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, $2 TRILLION ON HEALTH CARE. BY 2016, HEALTH COSTS ARE SCHEDULED TO EXCEED $4 TRILLION OR ALMOST 20% OF G.D.P. THAT MEANS WITHIN LESS THAN 10 YEARS, 20 CENTS OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR PRODUCED IN AMERICA, WILL BE SPENT ON HEALTH CARE. NO OTHER COUNTRY SPENDS MORE THAN 12%. A DIFFERENCE OF MORE THAN $500 BILLION. ALL OTHER WEALTHY COUNTRIES SPEND EVEN LESS. WE SPEND $5,711 PER PATIENT. THE NEXT HIGHEST SPENDING COUNTRY, SWITZERLAND, SPENDS 3,000 487 ON PATIENTS. YET THEY COVER EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR CITIZENS AND HAVE AN AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY THAT IS THREE YEARS LONGER THAN OURS. HOW HAVE OUR COSTS SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL LIKE THIS? WELL, ABOUT 30% OF THE RISE IN HEALTH CARE SPENDING IS LINKED TO THE DOUBLING OF OBESITY AMONG ADD UTILITIES OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS. IN OTHER WORDSF OUR OBESITY LEVELS REMAINED AT 1990 LEVELS, WE WOULD BE SPENDING 10% LESS ON HEALTH CARE TODAY, A SAVINGS OF $220 BILL WRON. ABOUT 2/3 OF THE RISE IN HEALTH CARE SPENDING IS ASSOCIATED WITH A RISE IN THE PREVALENCE OF TREATABLE DISEASES LIKE DIABETES BEAT EAST, ASTHMA AND HEART DISEASE. 75% OF ALL HEALTH CARE SPENDING, $1.5 TRILLION, IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 4% TO 5% OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE MULTIPLE CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND REQUIRE ONGOING MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OVER YEARS. AND 10% TO 12% OF THE TOTAL HEALTH CARE BUDGET IS SPENT ON END OF LIFE CARE. OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE BY FAR THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD. TODAY, MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR HEALTH CARE DOLLARS GOES TO ADMINISTRATION. 64% OF PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS, ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE DEDICATED TO UNDERWRITING HEALTH RISKS, SALES AND MARKETING. EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA SPENDS $412 ON HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION, NEARLY SIX TIMES AS MUCH AS OTHER COUNTRIES. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT BY MCKENZIE, THE UNITED STATES SPENDS MORE THAN OTHER COUNTRIES ON EXCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH DELIVERING GOOD HEALTH CARE. TOO MUCH OF THE MONEY WE SPEND IS WASTED ON CARE THAT DOESN'T EVEN IMPROVE HEALTH. A STUDY IN SANTA BARBARA FOUND THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE LAB TESTS AND X-RAYS WERE CONDUCTED SOLELY BECAUSE PREVIOUS TEST RESULTS WERE UNAVAILABLE. A RECENT STUDY REPORTED IN THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY FOUND THAT 2/3 OF THE PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED $15,000 SURGERY TO PREVENT STROKES, THERE WAS NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THE SURGERY ACTUALLY WORKED. AT THE SAME TIME, IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE BENEFITS OF INTERVENTION ARE CLEAR, MANY PATIENTS STILL DON'T RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED. A RECENT STUDY IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, OVERALL, AMERICANS GET NEEDED CARE 55% OF THE TIME. IF WE SPEND SO MUCH, WHY DOES THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION RANK THE UNITED STATES 31ST IN LIFE EXPACTANCY AND 40TH IN CHILD MORTALITY, WORSE THAN CUBA. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS PLAGUED WITH UNDERUSE, OVERUSE AND MISUSE. IT IS SIMPLY PUT, BROKEN. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MAKE IT MY MISSION TO FIX IT. STARTING BY HELPING THE 250 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INSURANCE WHO FACE SKYROCKETING COSTS, INADEQUATE CARE AND BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES TO COVERAGE. TODAY, ANNOUNCING A SEVEN-POINT PLAN AND TO MAKE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WITHOUT DOUBT FROM ANY CORNER, THE BEST IN THE WORLD. BUILDING A NATIONAL CONSENSUS AROUND THESE COST SAVINGS IS THE FIRST CRUCIAL STEP TO COVERING ALL AMERICANS WITH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. FIRST, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION, ON WELLNESS, NOT JUST SICKNESS. UNDER MY REFORMS, ALL AMERICANS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTIVE CARE, WHICH WILL SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. TODAY, WE PAY DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS TO TREAT DISEASES AND INJURIES, BUT NOT TO HELP PREVENT THEM FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. ONLY 38% OF ADULTS RECEIVE RECOMMENDED COLON RECTAL SCREENING. 20% OF CHILDREN DO NOT RECEIVE IMMUNIZATIONS. OUR COUNTRY SPENDS 1% TO 3% OF NATIONAL EXPENDITURES ON PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND HEALTH PROMOTION PER YEAR. THAT IS ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE WE SPENT IN THE 19 20'S. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MANY MORE ADULTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE II DIABETES. THE COST OF CARING FOR THEM IS INCREASING, MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES WON'T PAY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS PREDIABETIC OR DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES TO GO TO A NUTRITIONIST TO LEARN HOW TO EAT PROPERLY, TO GET PREVENTIVE MEDICINE OR POE DIE TERRORIST TO HAVE THEIR FEET CHECKED. BUT THEY WILL PAY IF HAVE YOU TO HAVE YOUR FOOT AMPUTATED. INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE, BECAUSE THE PATIENT MIGHT CHANGE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE ORIGINAL COMPANY WON'T GET THE BENEFITS OF THE MONEY THEY INVESTED. IF A PATIENT'S DOCTOR TELLS THE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT A FOOT NEEDS TO BE AMPUTATED, THE COMPANY IS STUCK. TALK ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT IS UPSIDE DOWN AND BACKWARDS. WE CLEARLY NEED A NEW APPROACH. WE KNOW WE CAN SAVE MONEY IF WE GIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES INCENTIVES TO COVER PREVENTIVE CARE AND WELLNESS SERVICES, AND MY PLAN WILL DO EXACTLY THAT. KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY TODAY WILL NOT ONLY KEEP COSTS DOWN IN THE FUTURE, BUT IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT PREVENTIVE CARE WORKS. I COULD CITE THOUSANDS OF EXAMPLES, BUT JUST CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. THE INCIDENTS OF DIABETES WAS 58% LOWER AMONG ADULTS WITH ELEVATED BLOOD SUGAR WHO WERE ENROLLED IN A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAN THE CONTROLLED GROUP THAT WAS ONLY GIVEN DRUGS. AMONG THOSE AGED 60 AND OLDER, THE REDUCTION WAS 71%. AND SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE LEADING TO THESE OUTCOMES WAS RIGHT HERE AT G.W. LOOK AT WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS TRYING TO DO. SAFE WAY HAS MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION. IT PAYS 100% OF ALL APPROPRIATE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES, OFFERS A 24-HOUR HOTLINE STAFFED BY REGISTERED NURSES AND PROVIDES SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE MANAGE CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND INCENTIVES DESIGNED TO PROMOTE HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES. THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. WHILE AVERAGE COSTS WENT WENT UP 7.7%, SAFEWAY PRESENT DIFFICULTIES ITS COSSES WILL BE FLAT. MOTOROLA SHOWED SAVINGS OF $4 FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. UNDER MY PLAN, ALL INSURERS WILL PARTICIPATE IN A FEDERAL HEALTH -- ALL INSURERS WHO ARE ALREADY PARTICIPATING IN A FEDERAL HEALTH PROGRAM, LIKE MEDICARE, MEDICAID OR THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN WILL HAVE TO COVER PREVENTION AS A CONDITION OF DOING BUSINESS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. INSURERS WOULD ENCOURAGE BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDERS TO USE PREVENTION SERVICES BY PAYING FOR BENEFITS LIKE CANCER SCREENINGS THAN IMMUNIZATIONS. MY PLAN POOLS PREVENTION SPENDING TO HELP REDEPLOY PREVENTIVE SERVICES. WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THIS WOULD PAY FOR PREVENTIVE CARE INITIATIVES IN SCHOOLS, SUPERMARKETS, CHURCHES AND COMMUNITIES. IT WOULD FUND AND TRAIN NEW PREVENTION AND OUTREACH WORKERS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE AND THE CULTURE OF VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS AROUND OUR COUNTRY. WE STILL HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL WHO COME IN UNABLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH AND BRINGING A CHILD TO INTERPRET, AND WE ARE NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB OF GETTING INFORMATION BROADLY AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. NOW, YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST INSURANCE PLAN IN THE WORLD, BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE MEDICINE YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBED OR FOLLOW THE LIFESTYLE ADVICE, YOU AREN'T GOING TO IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH. IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE COSTS, ALL OF US MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING BETTER CARE OF OURSELVES. THE SECOND WAY TO BRING COSTS UNDER CONTROL IS TO BRING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS RECORDKEEPING INTO THE 21ST CENTURY, LEAVING BEHIND PAPER RECORDS AND OUTDATED 20TH CENTURY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. IF YOU ARE RUSHED TO A HOSPITAL WITH A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY OR TO FIND OUT WHAT MEDICATIONS YOU'RE TAKING, WHAT SURGERIES WHAT YOU'VE HAD OR YOUR BLOOD TYPE. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD CHANGE THAT. THIS IS ALSO AFTER THE EVENT OF CATASTROPHES. AFTER KATRINA, MEDICAL RECORDS WERE UNDER WATER. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHO FLED THEIR HOMES OR WERE RESCUED DIDN'T KNOW THE NAMES OF THE DRUGS THEY WERE TAKING. ONLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BUYING DRUGS FROM DRUG STORES THAT HAD ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS COULD ACCESS TO FIND OUT WHAT THE DRUG WAS AND WHAT THE PRESCRIPTION SHOULD BE. MODERNIZING OUR SYSTEM WILL IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE AND REDUCE COSTS. PROCESSING PAPER CLAIMS IS AN AVERAGE $1.60 TO $2. AS A NATION, WE COULD SAVE MORE THAN $77 BILLION ANNUALLY DUE TO WIDESPREAD USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. AND THESE SAVINGS COULD DOUBLE WITH THE ADDITION OF PREVENTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT. IF THE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IMPACTS OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AS MUCH AS IT HAS IMPACTED OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL INDUSTRY, WE COULD SEE SAVINGS AS HIGH AS $346 BILLION ANNUALLY OR OVER 15% OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING. THERE IS NO REASON WHY PEOPLE'S HEALTH FILES, THEIR TEST RESULTS, THEIR LAB RECORDS, THEIR X-RAYS CAN'T BE STORED SECURELY AND CONFIDENTIALLY ON A COMPUTER FILE ACCESSIBLE FROM A DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR HOSPITAL. IN FACT, IF ALL HOSPITALS USE ADD COMPUTE RISED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM, AN ESTIMATED 200,000 FEWER ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS WOULD OCCUR, SAVING ROUGHLY $1 BILLION A YEAR. WE CAN ALSO USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO DISSEMINATE RESEARCH. A GOVERNMENT STUDY RECENTLY SHOWED IT TAKES 17 YEARS FROM THE TIME OF A NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERY TO THE TIME CLINICIANS ACTUALLY INCORPORATE THAT DISCOVERY INTO THEIR PRACTICE AT THE BEDSIDE. WHY NOT 17 SECONDS, THE MOMENT WE KNOW DISCOVERY IMPROVES CARE. THE VETERANS MEDICAL SYSTEM PROVIDES A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A FULLY AUTOMATED HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS, CLINICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS. IT'S RECORD SYSTEM CONTAINS EVERY DETAIL OF A PATIENT'S HEALTH RECORD, INCLUDING LABORATORY TEST RESULTS, MEDICAL IMAGES, BAR CODE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, PROGRESS NOTES AND APPOINTMENTS, ALL ACCESSIBLE ANYWHERE WITHIN THE V.A. SYSTEM. IT STARTED MODERNIZING ITS PROGRAMS IN 1993 USING HEALTH I.T. AND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND IT DELIVERS SOME OF THE BEST QUALITY HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH AMAZING EFFICIENCY. BETWEEN 1999 AND 2003, THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS ENROLLED IN THE V.A. SYSTEM INCREASED BY 70%, YET FUNDING NOT ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION INCREASED 41%. SO THE V.A. NOT ONLY HAS BECOME ONE OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY'S BEST QUALITY PERFORMER, IT HAS DONE SO WHILE SPENDING LESS ON EACH PATIENT. HEALTH CARE SPENDING PER CAPTAIN TAAVERAGETS $56,600. AT THE V.A., IT IS 20% LOWER EVEN THOUGH THE AVERAGE AGE OF A PATIENT IS 60. LAST YEAR I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL ANNOUNCING LEGISLATION THAT HAS SINCE PASSED THE SENATE THAT PROMOTES THE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SO WE CAN END THE PAPER CHASE, LIMIT MEDICAL ERRORS AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MALPRACTICE SUITS. IT WOULD ALLOW US TO USE I.T. TO DEVELOP A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM TO STREAMLINE OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS AND I BELIEVE REDUCE ERRORS AS WELL. NOW, I'M PROUD OF MY LEGISLATION. WE DIDN'T GET IT PASSED IN THE HOUSE LAST YEAR. WE'RE GOING TO TRY THIS YEAR. BUT IF WE DON'T GET IT PASS THE, I WILL HAVE IT AS ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES AS PRESIDENT. I WILL BUILD ON THAT LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRE HEALTH PROVIDERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS, WHICH IS NEARLY ALL OF THEM, TO ADOPT PRIVATE SECURE AND INTEROPERABLE TECHNOLOGY AND TO HELP HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS MODERNIZE THEIR SYSTEM AND PROMOTE THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF HEALTH I.T., I WOULD INVEST IN GRANTS TO RAMP UP THE SYSTEM. NO MORE PAPER RECORDS OR TRYING TO DECIPHER MESSY HANDWRITING. WE ARE GOING TO COORDINATE AND STREAMLINE THE CARE OUR CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS RECEIVE. AMERICANS WHO HAVE HEART DISEASE ACCOUNT FOR ASTONISHING PERCENTAGE. WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT THAT IT WAS 75% OF OUR NATIONAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THEIR CARE WILL HELP LIMIT COSTS AND IMPROVE HEALTH. TO THAT END I PROPOSE ESTABLISHING MEDICAL HOMES, SIMILAR TO THOSE OPERATING RIGHT NOW IN OREGON. DR. DAVID DORA, A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SPOKE TWO WEEKS AGO ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THESE MEDICAL HOMES. HE TOLD THE STORY OF A PATIENT, A 75-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN OREGON, WHO SUFFERED FROM FIVE CHRONIC ILLNESSES, INCLUDING DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND MILD CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY WHAT BILLS TO PAY AND WHAT PILLS TO TAKE. IN MOST CLINICS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, SHE WOULD RECEIVE CARE FROM QUALIFIED AND CAPABLE DOCTORS AND NURSES BUT HER CARE WOULD NOT LIKELY BE COORDINATED. HER PROVIDERS WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO EACH OTHER, MAKING SURE THAT THE TREATMENTS THEY WERE PRESCRIBING WERE WORKING TOGETHER. THIS RAISES COSTS AND INCREASES THE CHANCE SHE WILL SUFFER COMPLICATIONS OR END UP BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. ANYONE WHO HAS TRIED TO COORDINATE THE CARE OF THEIR OWN OR A LOVED ONE KNOWS THIS IS ALL TOO COMMON A SITUATION. FORTUNATELY HER CARE WAS ADDRESSED COMPREHENSIVELY THROUGH CARE MANAGEMENT PLUS IN OREGON, AN I.T. SYSTEM WITH TRAINED MANAGERS TO TREAT OLDER ADULTS WITH COMPLICATED CONDITIONS. SHE'S IN GOOD HANDS. HER CARE MANAGERS AND PRIMARY PHYSICIAN ADDRESSED HER SYMPTOMS EARLY AND PREVENTED HER PROBLEMS AND SHE HAS HELPED TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, SENIORS WITH COMPLEX DIABETES HAVE HAD A 20% REDUCTION IN MORTALITY, A 24% REDUCTION IN EXPENSIVE HOSPITALIZATION AND UP TO 42% IMPROVEMENT IN CONTROL OF THEIR DISEASE. EVERY PATIENT SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A SYSTEM WITH OUTCOMES LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHY MY PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE THAT AMERICANS WITH COSTLY, HARD TO MANAGE ILLNESSES HAVE ACCESS TO COORDINATED MODELS UNDER FEDERALLY FUNDED PLANS, LIKE MEDICARE AND THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PERMIT MULTISPECIALTY CLINICS, G.W., MAYO, PROVIDER-RESPONSE ORDER ORGANIZATIONS TO BID ON AND GIVE SERVICES, DRUG MANAGEMENT, DIET AND EXERCISE CONTROL AND THE PROMOTION OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY. WE KNOW THAT THIS COORDINATED CARE MODEL WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS. A RECENT RAND STUDY CONCLUDED THAT MANAGEMENT PRECEDED BY PREVENTION AND BACKED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD SAVE $147 BILLION ANNUALLY. ANOTHER STUDY FOUND THAT IT COULD REDUCE THE COST OF DIABETES BY 3% SAVING US $4 BILLION. FOURTH, MY PLAN WILL OFFER INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL BUSINESSES MARKET ACCESS TO LARGER INSURANCE POOLS THAT WILL LOWER COSTS AND END INSURANCE COMPANY DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AS PART OF A PLAN FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE, WHICH I WILL DISCUSS IN DETAIL, WE WOULD CREATE LARGE INSURANCE POOLS AT LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS BY SPREADING THE RISK. IN A SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE, INSURANCE COMPANIES CANNOT EASILY SHIFT COSTS TO CHERRY-PICKING AND OTHER MEANS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT MCKENZIE REPORT, INSURANCE COMPANIES SPEND TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR FIGURING OUT HOW NOT TO COVER PEOPLE, DOING COMPLICATED COMPLICATIONS TO CHERRY-PICK THE HEALTHIEST PERSON. THAT'S HOW THEY PROFIT. BY AVOIDING INSURING PATIENTS WHO WILL BE EXPENSIVE AND NOT PAYING UP WHEN THE PATIENT NEEDS TREATMENT. I SEE THIS ALL THE TIME. MY OFFICE SPENDS COUNTLESS HOURS TO GET MY CONSTITUENTS THE HEALTH CARE THEY HAVE PAID FOR. FOR EXAMPLE, A FATHER CALLED ME FROM NORTHERN NEW YORK. HIS SON HAD A RARE ILLNESS. NOW HE AND HIS SON WERE WELL INSURED. HE WORKED FOR MANY YEARS FOR A GOOD EMPLOYER WHO HAD A GOOD INSURANCE POLICY. BUT WHEN HIS SON NEEDED A SPECIAL OPERATION THAT COULD ONLY BE PERFORMED ATLANTA ONE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID SORRY, IT'S OUT OF NETWORK. SO MY OFFICE INTERVENED AND IN THE END THEY GOT PERMISSION FOR THE OPERATION. BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO THEIR UNITED STATES SENATOR TO GET THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY'VE PAID FOR. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL END THE PRACTICE OF INSURANCE COMPANY CHERRY-PICKING ONCE AND FOR ALL BY ALLOWING ANYONE WHO WANTS TO JOIN A PLAN DO SO AND PROHIBITING INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM CARVING OUT BENEFITS OR CHARGING HIGHER RATES TO PEOPLE WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS. I WILL CALL FOR RATING REFORMS TO ENSURE THAT OLDER AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. THE WHOLE POINT IS TO SPREAD RISK AGAINST A GROUP OF ENROLLEES. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE COST FOR MEDICARE ARE SO MUCH LOWER BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY INSURING EVERYONE. EVERYONE IS IN THE POOL AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER CONTROL THE COSTS WITHIN MEDICARE THAT THEY START WITH AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A CONSIDERABLY LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE COST. FINALLY, INSURERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVE THEY WERE SPENDING MUCH LESS ON MARKETING AND SCHEMES TO AVOID PROVIDING INSURANCE TO HIGH RISK AMERICANS AND MORE ON DIRECT CARE GIVING. THE MOST BUSINESSES IN SOME STATES HAVE BECOME TOUGH PURCHASERS OF HEALTH INSURANCE, INSISTING ON FAR MARKETING AND CRACKING DOWN ON OVERHEAD. WE SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR LEAD. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE ADVOCATED FOR 14 YEARS IS A COMMON VOW CAB BUE LAYER AND COMMON FORM THAT EVERY INSURANCE COMPANY MUST USE. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY COMMON SENSE IDEA SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY COMPARE AND CONTRAST WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR, BUT WHEN I PROPOSED IT BACK IN 1993 AND 1994, IT WAS VIGOROUSLY OBJECTED TO, BECAUSE WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY AND WE NEED THAT COMMON WORDING IN ORDER TO GET COSTS DOWN AND THAT'S OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE INSURERS WANT TO HAPPEN. BY INSURING ALL AMERICANS THROUGH ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLANS WE CAN GET RID OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT DO NOTHING BUT ADD MONEY TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. IN SUCH A REFORMED SYSTEM, RISK WOULD BE WIDELY SPREAD AND WE CAN REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BY AS MUCH AS $20 TO $30 BILLION A YEAR. I'LL START BY ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT, PUBLIC-PRIVATE BEST PRACTICES INSTITUTE. THIS INSTITUTE WOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP AMONG THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO FINANCE COMPARATIVE IF HE CANTIVENESS RESEARCH SO PROFESSIONALS AS WELL AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES WOULD KNOW WHAT DRUGS, DEVICES, SURGERIES AND TREATMENTS WORK BEST. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE USE OF INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE TREATMENTS. AND I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD HAVE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS, BECAUSE WE COULD GET EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE INTO THE BLOOD STREAM OF THE COUNTRY MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY. I SPEARHEADED A SIMILAR PROPOSAL TO AUTHORIZE THE AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY TO START DOING RESEARCH ON COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. EIGHT REPORTS HAVE BEEN RELEASED AND DOZENS MORE ARE UNDER WAY. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE FINDING, THESE SO-CALLED BLOCKBUSTER DRUGS ARE NO MORE EFFECTIVE AND SOMETIMES LESS EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CONDITIONS THAN OLD STAND-BIES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND DON'T HAVE ALL THE ADVERTISERS THAT CONVINCE PATIENTS THAT THEY NEED THE NEW DRUG AS OPPOSED TO THE ONE THAT HAS WORKED WELL. . >> THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IS DOING JUST THAT WINKING OUT OF POCKET ACROSS. AS OF 2005, A PITNEY BOWES HAS A MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS USING THIS METHOD. ANOTHER IDEA IT IS THE SUGGESTION OF A MEDICAL WARRANTY THAT CHARGES A FLAT FEE FOR SURGERY AND INCLUDES 90 DAYS OF FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT. CURRENTLY THERE IS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO SEEK OUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE SEARCH -- TREATMENTS. THE WARRANTY IS AN INCENTIVE TO DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXTRA BILLING IF MORE CARE IS NEEDED. THE DOCTORS HAVE IDENTIFIED 47 TO BYPASS SURGERY AND HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ALWAYS FOLLOWED. IT WILL NOT ONLY BE BENEFICIAL WITH RESPECT TO PHARMACEUTICALS BUT ALSO MEDICAL DEVICES AND EVEN PRACTICE PROTOCOLS AND I THINK IT WILL GIVE A LOT OF DOCTORS AMMUNITION AGAINST INSURANCE COMPANIES, DRUG COMPANIES AND EVEN SOMETIMES PATIENCE ABOUT WHAT WORKS BETTER THAN OTHER OPTIONS. AND THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND NONPROFITS THAT CONDUCTS USES OF WIDELY USED BY A SPRAINED N.C. HAS USED SUCH REVIEWS TO EDUCATE PROVIDER SAVING THE STATE IN ESTIMATED $80 MILLION IN 2003 ALONE. I CANNOT EXTRAPOLATE HOW MUCH WE SAVE AS A NATION, BUT I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE IN THE BILLIONS. IF YOU WANT TO GET HEALTH-CARE COSTS UNDER CONTROL, WE NEED TO GET PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS UNDER CONTROL. WE KNOW THAT AMERICANS AND HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY FUNDED THE RESEARCH ON AND FUNDED THE TRUST LACKS FUNDED THE CLINICAL TRIALS ON AND THEN THE FDA EVALUATION OF AND THEN WE PUT IT INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND WE STILL END UP IN THE HIGHEST PRICES. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE 55 PERCENT HIGHER IN THE ON STATES AND TOP SELLING MEDICATIONS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. OF THE PAST DECADE, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ACCOUNTED FOR 50% OF THE TOTAL INCREASE IN HEALTH SPENDING SPIRIT EVEN THOUGH THEY ACCOUNT FOR ONLY ABOUT 10% OF WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES. THE START GETTING DRUG COSTS UNDER CONTROL BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE A LOWER DRUG PRICES. AND TO LOWER THOSE COSTS FOR EVERYONE. WE ALSO HAVE TO CRACK DOWN ON THE OVERPAYMENT ON MEDICARE TO PRIVATE PLANS. THESE RATES ARE AROUND 12% HIGHER THAN MEDICARE TRADITIONALLY PAYS TO TREAT THE SAME BENEFICIARY'S REDUCING THESE OVERPAYMENTS AS A MEDICARE $10 BILLION TO $20 MILLION A YEAR. WE SHOULD ALSO ALLOW THE IMPORTATION OF DRUGS FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES TO LOWER COSTS AND REMOVE BARRIERS TO GENERIC COMPETITION TO AN 53% OF PRESCRIPTIONS ARE GENERIC AMERICANS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY 12% OF MEGA PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS. WE NEED TO BREAK THE MONOPOLY THAT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE OVER THEIR PRODUCTS THAT CAN COST US SO MUCH MONEY. MOST AMERICANS HAVE NO IDEA THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW GENERIC MILE PHARMACEUTICALS ARE PRECLUDED FROM GOING TO MARKETS AND BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT. THE COST DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN GENERIC AND NON GENERIC DRUGS IS AN ASTOUNDING. THE AVERAGE COST FOR A ONE DAY SUPPLY OF NON GENERIC DRUGS WAS $45 BUT ONLY A DOLLAR AND 66 CENTS FOR A GENERIC DRUG. THAT'S ONLY $1.66. A NUMBER OF FORWARD-LOOKING BIOTECH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT I INTRODUCED TO SENATOR CHARLES SCHUMER AND HENRY WAXMAN AND PROVIDING SUCH COMPETITION. THE FINAL POINT I WOULD MAKE TODAY ABOUT LOWERING COSTS IS TO REDUCE COSTS THROUGH MEDICAL MALPRACTICE REFORM. SOME OF OVER STATED WHAT THIS PLACE IN A CRISIS, I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED REFORM THAT WERE IS FOR DOCTORS AND PATIENTS. I OFFER ONE SOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY CALL THE NATIONAL MEDICAL CARE DISCLOSURE AND COMPENSATION ACT. IT IS A NOVEL APPROACH TO IMPROVING PATIENT SAFETY AND THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE OF PROTECTING PATIENTS' RIGHTS AND REDUCING MEDICAL ERRORS AND LORING MALPRACTICE COSTS. THIS ACT TO ENCOURAGE PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE LIABILITY PROTECTION TO PHYSICIANS TO DISCLOSE MEDICAL ERRORS TO PATIENTS AND OFFER TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS FOR FAIR COMPENSATION. AT THE UNIVERSITY MICHIGAN, THESE POLICIES HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN GREATER PATIENT SATISFACTION AND MORE PATIENTS ARE BEING COMPENSATED FOR INJURIES AND FEAR OF MALPRACTICE SUITS AS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND BETWEEN $1,000,000.3000000 DOLLARS OF SAVINGS. THAT ALLOWED DOCTORS TO CREATE THEIR OWN RISK COMPANIES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE. A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF ACTUAL MALPRACTICE IS COMMITTED BY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF DOCTORS WHO WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN INSURANCE FOR SOME OTHER DOCTORS CONTROL. THEREBY LURING MALPRACTICE RATES FOR ALL. AS I'VE MADE CLEAR IN THIS POINT, WE KNOW THAT IF WE CONTINUE ON OUR PRESENT PASS A HEALTH-CARE COSTS WILL DOUBLE WITHIN A DECADE AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL SPEND INCREASING AMOUNTS OF WE ARE NOT SURE ABOUT IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT WE KNOW THAT IT WILL NOT IMPROVE QUALITY AND OUTCOME. HOW WILL THIS ACTUALLY WORK? AND HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME. ACCORDING TO RAM HIS AND SAID THE HEALTH-CARE COST FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WE COULD SAVE $147 BILLION FROM THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CHANGES I RECOMMENDED AND $20 BILLION TO $30 BILLION IN ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. THERE ARE BILLIONS MORE AND COUNTLESS OTHER INEFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE RUN OUT OF OUR SYSTEM. WE ALSO WILL HAVE TO MOVE TOWARD A SYSTEM WHERE IT IS A DOCTOR AND PATIENT CENTERED AND CONSUMER DRIVEN IF WE EXPECT TO REALLY GET THE RESULTS THAT WE NEED. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT AT LEAST $120 BILLION IN PROJECTED SAVINGS THAT I HAVE INCLUDED IN MY PLANS ARE NOT ONLY REASONABLE BUT EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THIS IS KIND OF OVERLY 110 WHICH IS WHY I AM GLAD THERE IS AN AUDIENCE OF HERE -- THAT UNDERSTAND A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. A BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE HAS RECENTLY ESTIMATED THAT JUST WITH A SYSTEM THAT USED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY A TYPICAL FAMILY WOULD SAVE 20 TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND I THINK THAT IS A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE OUTCOME. -- 20 TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE MONEY WE SAVE AND HOW WE CARE FOR PEOPLE SHOULD BE USED TO HELP FINANCE COVERAGE. ALSO WHEN YOU INSURE EVERYONE, IT WILL MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT I RECOMMENDED. WITH EARLY CARE AS OPPOSED TO A MORE TO SECURE AS WELL AS CUTTING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. OUR PRESENT SYSTEM IS OUTDATED AND UNSUSTAINABLE. WE OUGHT TO DO THIS AND MANY OF YOU IN THIS AUDIENCE TO GIVE ME 10 MORE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO IMMEDIATELY. THE KEY IS TO DEVELOP A POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THEY'RE A COALITION OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED. THE PEOPLE WHO DELIVER CARE, OUR DOCTORS, NURSES, PHARMACISTS AND OTHERS, THE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR CARE AND THE BUSINESSES AND OUR GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE CARE WHICH IS THE REST OF US. I KNOW VERY WELL THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL RUN INTO CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION FROM FORCES THAT DO NOT WANT CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THAT EQUALLY IMPORTANT WAY TO HAVE A PLAN AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A POLITICAL CONSENSUS. THAT IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO DEVELOP AS I TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE I THINK AMERICANS ARE READY FOR CHANGE AND THEY'RE READY FOR A HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES BETTER RESULTS AT LOWER COST AND IS THE SHAME OF US NOT COVERING 45 MILLION AMERICANS. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE CAN PURSUE THESE GOALS AND I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN BEING PART OF THE BROAD BASE COALITION THAT WILL NOT ONLY TALK ABOUT AND DEMAND CHANGE, BUT WERE TO MAKE SURE STARTING IN 2009 THAT OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM ACTUALLY DELIVERS THE CHANGES WE ALL KNOW OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM DESPERATELY NEEDS. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> WE ARE ONE TO TAKE A BREAK. >>",2015-11-07 17:23:46,2007-05-24,Washington,District of Columbia
http://www.c-span.org/video/?200644-1/huckabee-campaign-speech,Huckabee Campaign Speech,Mike Huckabee,"HOUR. >> I AM SO HONORED AND SO VERY PROUD TO INTRODUCE MIKE HUCKABEE, THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. HE WAS MY GOVERNOR FOR 10 PLUS YEARS FROM 1996 TO JANUARY OF 2007. THE 44th GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. AGAINST THE ODDS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAVING 25% REPUBLICAN AND 75% DEMOCRAT PARTY REPRESENTATION, GOVERNOR HUCKABEE ACCOMPLISHED MIRACLES. HE BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER. I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE POWER POINT VERBALLY OF SOME OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS. HE CUT FEES AND TAX 90 TIMES AND HE PUSHED THROUGH THE FIRST MAJOR BROAD-BASED TAX CUT IN PARTY'S HISTORY.IN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. HE ESTABLISHED PROPERTY TAXPAYER BILLING RIGHTS AND REDUCED WELFARE ROLES BY 50%. [APPLAUSE] THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGIES. HE VASTLY IMPROVED THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HAVE ALIGNMENT EVERY TIME I DROVE TO LITTLE ROCK, THE HIGHWAYS WERE FIXED. HE VASTLY IMPROVED THE STATE'S PARK SYSTEM. HE CREATED ARKANSAS KIDS FIRST, A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF 17,000 CHILDREN WHO FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE. HE BEGAN HEALTHY ARKANSAS INITIATIVES WHICH ENCOURAGED EXERCISE, EATING HEALTHY, AND TO HELP PEOPLE STOP SMOKING. UPGRADE, MODERNIZE AND BUILT MAJOR ADDITIONS TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. NO EXPENSE TO THE TAXPAYER. WHEN DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES IN 2005, HE LOST 110 POUNDS WHICH WAS MENTIONED. WITHIN TWO YEARS, HE RAN FOUR MARATHONS. HE WAS NAMED ATHLETE OF THE WEEK BY U.S.A. TRACK AND FIELD. QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. HE CREATED A STATE-OF-THE-ART AUTOMOBILE LICENSE RENEWAL SYSTEM WHICH BECAME A MODEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND INSTEAD OF SPENDING A HALF DAY GETTING YOUR RENEWAL, STANDING IN LINES, IT BECAME INSTANT. HE IMPROVED EDUCATION AND EDUCATION ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROMOTED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND BROUGHT UP THE CHILDREN'S EDUCATION STANDARDS. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THERE IS MANY THING WE CAN SAY THAT WOULD TAKE ME THREE DAYS TO STATE IT ALL. IN 2005, ""TIME"" MAGAZINE VOTED HIM ONE OF THE FIVE BEST GOVERNORS IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THEN IN HIS SPARE TIME HE WROTE FIVE BOOKS. BOTTOM LINE, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE DEMONSTRATED OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP ABILITIES. HE SOLVED UNSOLVABLE PROBLEMS IN A DIFFICULT STATE. HE AND HIS WIFE JANET LEFT A LEGACY IN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. I LIVE THERE AND I KNOW THIS IS TRUE. I STRONGLY BELIEVE HE CAN DO THE SAME FOR ALL CITIZENS OF AMERICA AS OUR PRESIDENT. MIKE HUCKABEE HAS THE MIND, THE SERVANT ATTITUDE, THE STAMINA, THE ABILITY, THE INNER PEACE, AND THE WILL TO LEAD OUR NATION TO FURTHER GREATNESS. LET'S HEAR MORE FROM HIM AND WELCOME MIKE HUCKABEE. MY FRIEND. I HAVE A SURPRISE. ONE MORE THING. THIS IS HIS BIRTHDAY. CAN WE SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY? HAR HAR HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU INSTEAD (music) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU (music)(music) HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MIKE (music)(music) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU. (music)(music) AND MANY MORE! >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU NOTICED I DIDN'T JUMP UP ON THE STAGE LIKE GOVERNOR DANIELS DID. THERE IS A REASON WHY. I AM A CANDIDATE AND RIGHT NOW PEOPLE FOLLOW AROUND WITH VIDEO CAMERAS FOR EVERYTHING I DO. I KNOW FULL WELL IF I JUMPED UP ON THE STAGE AND MISSED, MY CAMPAIGN WOULD BE OVER BECAUSE EVERY YOU TUBE WATCHNER AMERICA WOULD BE WATCHING ME TUMBLE ACROSS THE STAGE. MITCH, I HAVE TO TELL YOU I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE ACROBATICS OF GETTING ON THE STAGE. I WILL SAY THANK YOU. FIRST FOR A GRACIOUS INTRODUCTION AND THEN FOR THE KINDNESS OF SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. I WAS BORN IN 19 -- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. IT'S A WHILE AGO. I'M 52 YEARS OLD TODAY AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GO OOH, AWE, YOU DON'T LOOK IT. APPARENTLY YOU THINK I LOOK OLDER THAN THAT AND THAT HURTS. IT REALLY DOES. WHAT AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY AND I KNOW YOU WILL HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND. PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER AMERICA GATHERING TOGETHER HERE IN THE MIDWEST AND I WANT TO SAY A WORD OF THANKS FOR MY FRIENDS FROM IOWA. THEY GAVE ME A GREAT BOOST IN THE STRAW POLL WHO SOME PEOPLE SAY IT DIDN'T MEAN A LOT. IT MEANT A LOT TO US. MANY OF YOU IF YOU VOTED FOR ME, GOD BLESS YOU AND KEEP IT UP. IF YOU DIDN'T, WE WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE IN THE CAUCUSES. TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS SPEAKING IN ARKANSAS AT THE LINCOLN DAY DINNER. I WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AT THE TIME AND HAD BEEN IN OFFICE ABOUT A YEAR AND WAS RUNNING FOR REELECTION. I WAS ELECTED IN THE SPECIAL ELECTION AND NEEDED TO TURN AROUND AND RUN AGAIN. DICK HOLMAN, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE INVITED ME UP AND WHEN I GOT THERE, I REALIZED THERE WAS A BUFFET LINE AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SMART TO COME THROUGH AND PICK UP THEIR PLATES AND GET THEIR FOOD BEFORE GOING TO THE EVENT. I SHOOK EVERY HAND AS PEOPLE PICKED UP A PLATE AND GOT THEIR FOOD AND WERE SEATED. WHEN ALL WERE SEATED, I REACHED OVER AND GOT A PLATE AND HEADED TO GO TO THE BUFFET LINE. THE YOUNG MAN WORKING FOR THE HOTEL CATERER SAID EXCUSE ME, DO YOU HAVE A TICKET? I SAID NO, ACTUALLY I DON'T HAVE A TICKET, I'M THE SPEAKER TONIGHT. HE SAID THAT'S GREAT. BUT YOU NEED A TICKET IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT. I SAID WELL, YOU PROBABLY DON'T RECOGNIZE ME, I'M MIKE HUCKABEE AND I'M THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND I'M THE GUEST SPEAKER AND THEY DIDN'T SEND ME A TICKET. HE SAID WOW, THAT'S PRETTY COOL. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A TICKET IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT. I REALIZED I WASN'T GETTING ANYWHERE AND I WENT UP TO THE HEAD TABLE AND SAT DOWN. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. HE LOOKED OVER AND SAW I DIDN'T HAVE A PLATE. HE SAID WERE YOU NOT HUNGRY? I SAID ACTUALLY I WAS, BUT THE YOUNG MAN SAID IF I DIDN'T HAVE A TICKET I COULDN'T GET A PLATE. YOU COULD SEE THE COLOR COMING OUT OF DICK'S FACE. EMBARRASSED. HE JUMPED UP AND HE WAS READY I KNOW TO GO BACK AND REAM THAT YOUNG MAN OUT. I GRABBED HIM AND I PULLED HIM DOWN AND I SAID DICK, SIT DOWN. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SAY A WORD TO HIM BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST TEENAGER I HAVE STPHAOEPB A LONG TIME WHO DID WHAT HE WAS TOLD TO DO. A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDER WHY REPUBLICANSHAD SUCH A TOUGH YEAR LAST YEAR. IT WAS A TOUGH YEAR. WE WENT FROM HAVING THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE IN WASHINGTON TO THINK IN THE MINORITY. A YEAR AGO WE HAD THE MAJORITY OF ALL GOVERNORSHIPS IN THE COUNTRY AND NOW IN THE MINORITY. WE HAD THE MAJORITY OF STATE LEGISLATURES AND NOW WE STRUGGLE. NEXT YEAR SOME PREDICT WE WILL HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING THE WHITE HOUSE. I'M ONE OF SEVERAL REPUBLICANS GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO REMIND YOU WHEN REPUBLICANS DO WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TO DO BY THE PEOPLE WHO ELECT THEM, THEY STAY ELECTED. IT'S WHEN REPUBLICANS DON'T DO WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TO DO WHEN THEY GET BEAT. [APPLAUSE] >> WHEN REPUBLICANS DIDN'T CONTROL SPENDING AND WE FORGOT TO STAND DILIGENTLY AGAINST CORRUPTION AND WHEN WE DO NOT EXPRESS A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN WHICH THE MANNER THAT WE GOVERN, WE GET IN TROUBLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS NEW BEGINNING UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF HARRY REED AND NANCY PELOSI IS THE LOWEST CONGRESS EVER HAD. THAT'S AMAZING CONSIDERING THE LOW APPROVAL RATINGS CONGRESS HAD. I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE RATINGS BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE BEST HOPE WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK THE CONGRESS WHICH I HOPE WE DO. UNLESS YOU THINK I COME HERE AS A PESSIMIST, NOT ONE BIT. IF ANYTHING, I'M QUITE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR PARTY, BUT MORE ABOUT OUR NATURE. THE REASON I AM IS THIS NATION IS IN FACT STILL WITH ALL OFS IT PROBLEMS THE GREATEST PLACE ON EARTH. IF YOU DON'T THINK IT IS, THINK ABOUT THIS. WE NOW ARE STILL A NATION WHERE WE ARE SERIOUSLY LOOKING AT AND NEEDING TO DO SOMETHING TO SECURE OUR BORDERS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BREAKING OUT, BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BREAKING IN. IT'S STILL THE MOST POPULAR PLACE ON EARTH FOR A PERSON TO PUT HIS OR HER FEET AND FOR GOOD CAUSE. [APPLAUSE] I WAS ASKED BY A REPORTER RECENTLY IF I WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME. SHE SAID YOU SEEM TO BE. I SAID WHY WOULDN'T I BE? I KNOW WHERE I COME FROM. I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT THE PATH THAT'S LED ME TO THIS POINT. I DID NOT GROW UP A CHILD OF PRIVILEGE. NO THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG OF THAT. I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT IF I HAD THE CHANCE. THAT WASN'T MY LOT IN LIFE. I DIDN'T GROW UP BLUE BLOOD. I GREW UP BLUE COLLAR. MY DAD WAS A FIREMAN AND WORKED FOR THE CITY OF HOPE, ARKANSAS. HE HAD A SECOND JOB AND WORKED AS A MECHANIC ON DAYS OFF AND THERE WASN'T A DAY IN MY DAD'S WHERE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE WORK ON HIS HANDS. HE COULDN'T QUITE GET IT OFF. THE ONLY SOAP WE EVER HAD WAS LAVA SOAP. FOR THOSE OF WHO YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, I WAS IN COLLEGE BEFORE I FOUND OUT THAT A SHOWER IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HURT. THE FANCY WORD TODAY IS EXFOLIATION. WE CALLED IT A BATH. WHEN I WAS YEARS OLD, MY DAD TOOK ME TO MEET THE GOVERNOR AND I WAS COMING DOWN TO MAKE A SPEECH IN HOPE. GOVERNORS NEVER CAME DOWN TO OUR PART OF THE STATE. WE WERE SO FAR FROM THE CAPITOL OF LITTLE ROCK. HE SAID SON, THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO DEDICATE A LAKE AND I WILL TAKE YOU BECAUSE YOU MAY LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIVE AND NEVER GET TO MEET A GOVERNOR IN PERSON. IF SOMEBODY HAD EVER TOLD HIM HIS SON WAS GOING TO BECOME THE 44th GOVERN NOR AND RUN FOR PRESIDENT, HE THOUGHT THAT'S RIGHT, AND I WILL PULL OUT A SPACE SHUTTLE. I AM LIVING BETTER THAN MY PARENTS COULD HAVE HOPED. THE REASON BECAUSE OF THE SACRIFICES THEY MADE FOR ME. THE OLDER I GET, EVEN THOUGH MY FATHER HAS BEEN GONE FOR OVER 11 YEARS, I'M STILL LEARNING ALMOST EVERY YEAR NEW THINGS ABOUT THE SACRIFICES ME AND MY MOTHER MADE SO I COULD HAVE A BETTER LIFE. I'M THE FIRST MALE IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY LINEAGE TO EVEN GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL MUCH LESS GO TO COLLEGE. LIKE SO MANY OF YOU IF YOU ASKED ME TODAY ARE YOU LIVING BETTER THAN YOU DREAMED YOU WOULD BE AS A KID? MY HAND WOULD BE THE HIGHEST IN THE AIR TODAY. I SOMETIMES ASK ROOMS OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS, DO YOU THINK YOUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS ARE GOING TO BE LIVING BETTER THAN YOU? SOMETIMES IT'S PRETTY SAD WHEN NOT A SINGLE HAND GOES UP. I BELIEVE THE PARTY THAT CAN LEAD THIS PARTY BACK TO THE SENSE OF RESILIENCE AND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE IS THE PARTY THAT NOT ONLY WILL WIN, BUT THE PARTY THAT HAS A RIGHT TO HAVE EARNED THE CAPACITY TO GOVERN THIS COUNTRY AND LEAD US NOT TO DAYS THAT ARE JUST OKAY, BUT TO REMEMBERING THAT THE GREATEST GENERATION DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE GENERATION THAT HAS COME BEHIND US. IT OUGHT TO BE THE ONE YET TO BE BORN. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, WE HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL LEADERSHIP. I DON'T THINK A PERSON WITH THEY WASHINGTON ADDRESS HAS AN ADVANTAGE GOING INTO THIS ELECTION BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IN WASHINGTON AND THEY SEE A CLIMATE THAT IS SO POLARIZED IT'S PARALYZE AND PROBLEMS ARE NOT GETTING SOLVED. AND SADLY, A LOT OF THE POLITICAL REALM IS FIXATED ON THINGS THAT ARE HORIZONTAL. LEFT, RIGHT, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN. AS I LISTEN TO MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE MISS DANIELS TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GOVERNOR, I WAS THINKING COULDN'T AGREE MORE. WE GET ELECT FRIDAY OUR PARTIES, BUT WE SERVE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. HOPEFULLY WE SOLVE THEM WITH THE IDEAS OF PRINCIPALS INTACT. IT IS A JOB OF BEING PRACTICING MAT SKPEUBG PRACTICAL AND BRINGING RESULTS. QUITE FRANKLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LESS INTERESTED IN WHETHER WE ARE LEFT, RIGHT, LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE OR DEMOCRAT. NOT THIS SIDE OR THIS SIDE O BUT ARE WE VERTICAL AND TAKE THEM UP AND DOWN AND THEY WILL ELECT AND SUPPORT THE ONES WHO LEAD THEM UP TO FACE THE PROBLEMS WE FACE. IF THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT, WE WON'T WIN AND WON'T DESERVE TO WIN. IT IS ABOUT GOING TO THE ISSUES THAT AMERICANS CARE ABOUT AND SAYING HERE'S HOW WE ARE GOING TO FIX IT. THE REASON THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ANGRY WITH CONGRESS IS THEY SAT ON THEIR HANS WHILE THE BORDERS ARE WIDE OPEN AND IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO GET ON AN AIRPLANE IN YOUR HOME THAN FOR AN ILLEGAL TO CROSS THE BORDER ON AN INTERNATIONAL LINE AND PEOPLE SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DON'T THINK WE ARE UPSET WITH THE IMMIGRANTS. IF I LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH, I WOULD WANT TO COME HERE TOO. WE ARE NOT UPSET WITH THEM. WE ARE UPSET WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHO THROWS UP ITS HANDS AND SAYS WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. THEY WILL SAY HOW DO WE FIX THIS STPWH- START BY DOING THE SAME THING YOU DID TO ME AT THE AIRPORT. GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF LINES TO GET THROUGH. I'M THE GOVERNOR OF MY STATE FOR 10.5 YEARS AND I GO TO THE AIRPORT INTH ROCK AND THEY SAY HI, GOVERNOR. HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOT BAGS, GOVERNOR? YES, SIR. >> CAN WE SEE YOUR PHOTO I.D.? >> I THOUGHT YOU JUST HAD IT. YOU TOLL ME WHO I WAS. I DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAW. THE POINT IS THEY WILL SAY WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO KEEP UP WITH THE FOLKS. I ORDER SOMETHING OFF OF AMAZON.COM AND THEY KEEP UP WITH IT FROM THE TIME IT LEAVES THE WAREHOUSE UNTIL THE TIME IT ARRIVES AT MY DOORSTEP. IF I BECOME PRESIDENT AND WITH ALL THE RESOURCES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IF WE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH PEOPLE, WE WILL OUT SOURCE TO FEDEX OR U.P.S. AND THEY'LL DO A GOOD KWROB. -- JOB. WE ALL UNDERSTAND WE FACE SERIOUS CHALLENGES THAT ARE OUT THERE NAY DANGEROUS WORLD. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AT WAR WITH AN ENEMY. UNLIKE ANY WE EVER FACED. IT'S NOT A COUNTRY. IT'S NOT AN ENEMY WHO FLIES UNDER A FLAG OR HAS A SEUPBLG LEADER. WHILE POLITICALLY INCORRECT, THIS IS ROOTED IN A RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM THAT MEANS OUR WAR IS NOT A TRADITIONAL GEO POLITICAL WAR OVER BOUNDARYS AND BORDERS. IT IS A THEOLOGICAL WAR BEING FOUGHT BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN WIN IT IS NOT TO HAVE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, BUT IT IS A DANGEROUS WAR. ANY PRESIDENT MUST UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CANNOT NEGOTIATE, COMPROMISE, OR ACCOMMODATE THOSE WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO DESTROY. [APPLAUSE] >> I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S NOT ONLY TAKING THE FIGHT, BUTT NATIONAL SECURITY DEPENS ON MAKING SURE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WE MAKE THIS NATION THE STRONGEST NATION IT CAN POSSIBLY BE AND WE PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE IT THAT WAY. WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL FACE AS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN. ARE THE ISSUES INTERNATIONALLY OR DOMESTICALLY. WHEN I GET ON AN AIRPLANE, WHICH WING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT? THE ON THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT? WHEN I FLY, I LIKE TO SEE THAT BOTH ARE FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE FUSELAGE. IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER KNOWING THAT IT FLIES BETTER WHEN BOTH ARE THERE. I DON'T THINK WE CAN SEPARATE THOSE TWO VERY CRITICAL AREAS OF URGENCY FOR FOR OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE. LET ME SAY OUR COUNTRY HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE ONE THAT CAN FEED ITSELF IN THE MIDWEST. WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ARKANSAS. THE COUNTRIES THAT CANNOT FEED THEMSELVES ARE THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT FREE. THEY ARE DEPENDENT UPON THOSE THAT FEED THEM. A COUNTRY ALSO MUST BE ABLE TO FUEL ITSELF AND I THINK OUR COUNTRY HAS TO QUIT TALKING ABOUT 20 AND 30-YEAR LEVELS OF INDEPENDENCE. IN 10 YEARS WE WILL BE ENERGY-INDEPENDENT AND NO LONGER ACCEPT THE IDEA -- [APPLAUSE] -- WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT THE IDEA OF BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDEAST FOR WHATEVER PRICE. I AM PUTTING A CREDIT CARD IN THE GAS PUMP AND MAKING THIS FAMILY MORE OBSCENELY RICH AND BEING HELD HOSTAGE TO THEM AND THINGS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. IT'S TIME WE HAD AN ENERGY SUPPLY AND MAKE THE COMMITMENT THAT WE DO IT WITHIN A DECADE AND THIS COUNTRY PUTSS IT MIND TO IT AND THEY MUST DO IT FOR OUR OWN SURVIVAL. WE HAVE TO BE AHEAD TO FUEL OURSELVES. [APPLAUSE] FINALLY WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR OURSELVES. A COUNTRY IS NOT FREE IF F IT DEPENDS ON SOMEONE ELSE TO MANUFACTURE WEAPONS OF SELF DEFENSE. WHEN I SEE MANUFACTURING JOBS CONTINUE TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY, THERE IS A MATTER OF URGENCY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T PRODUCE EVERY LAST THING IN THIS COUNTRY SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HAVE IT IMPORTED BACK TO US. I UNDERSTAND WE LIVE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. I'M ALL FOR THAT. FREE TRADE IS A GREAT THING. IT'S NOT FREE IF IT'S NOT FAIR. WE HAVE SEEN THIS LAST WEEK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CHINESE ARE UNDER THE SAME REGULATORY POWERS WE ARE WHETHER IT'S FOOD OR PET FOOD THAT COMES BACK THAT IS NOT AS SAFE FOR US AS IF IT WAS PRODUCED HERE. WE WILL HAVE TO START SAYING WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY ONLY WHEN IT HAS AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD FOR EVERYONE PARTICIPATING AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS A CHANGE OF UNDERSTANDING WHEN WE ARE GOING PLAY THAT EVERYBODY PLAYS BY THE SAME SET OF RULES. PART OF THE REASON WE KEEP LOSING THESE JOBS IS WHEN WE HAVE EXCESSIVE TAXATION AND REGULATION AND EXCESSIVE LITIGATION AND THE RESULT IS EXCESSIVE JOB MIGRATION. THE JOBS DISAPPEAR. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US COMPLETELY OVER HAUL OUR PAOUPBIVE TAX SYSTEM. IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. 177,000 PAGES OF THE IRS AND EVEN THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. YOU CERTAINLY DON'T. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO HIRE ACCOUNTANTS TO HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT. $250 BILLION SPENT IN COMPLIANCE? IF WE WOULD IMPOSE THE FAIR TAX AND GET RID OF THE CURRENT TAX CODE, IT MEANS WE ELIMINATE THE TAXES ON PRODUCTIVITY, INCOME, DIFDENS, SAVINGS AND CAPITAL GAINS. WHAT WE REPOLICE IT WITH IS THE KID THAT RUNS A LEMONADE STAND UNDERSTANDS. THE $10 TRILLION OF CAPITAL CAN RETURN HOME AND GET TO WORK IN OUR ECONOMY THAN IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S AND IT WOULD BE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DAY FOR OUR ECONOMY AND SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] I LONG TO SEE THE DAY WHEN AS A COUNTRY WE REMEMBER OUR ROOTS AND PARTICULARLY AS REPUBLICANS, LOWER TACKS ARE BETTER THAN HIGHER TAXS AND MOTHERS AND FATHERS RAISE BETTER KIDS THAN GOVERNMENTS AND WE BELIEVE THE BEST GOVERNMENT IS THE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT'S CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE AND ONE THING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THAT WE RENEW THAT SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TENTH AMENDMENT IS A PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION. FOR A LONG TIME, WE UNDERSTOOD IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFER AND HAMILTON FPLT HIS IDEA WAS TO HAVE STRONG STATES AND WE DON'T HAVE AN OVERLY FOCUSED POWER VESTED IN A CENTRALIZED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAMILTON THOUGHT WE NEEDED A STRONG CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT AND WEAK STATES. HE DIDN'T TRUST PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL AREAS AND THE STATES. THEY HAD THAT BATTLE. JEFFERSON WON AND THUS THE TENTH AMENDMENT AND THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD NEVER CONCENTRATE TOO MUCH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IN POWER STATES SO THEY COULD MAKE GOOD DECISIONS AND BECOME THE LABORATORIES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD BE SHARE AND THE BAD IDEAS THAT WOULD NOT BE REPEATED. IT SEEMS LIKE THE GHOST OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON CAME UP OUT OF THE GRAVE AND IS HAUNTING US AGAIN. WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A REPUBLICAN PARTY IS MAKE SURE WE GET BACK TO THE ROOTS AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE A PARTY WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEE TOO MUCH POWER CENTRALIZED, BUT TO STAGE THE LIVING LABORATORIES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT FOR EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE AND TRANSPORTATION AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE OUR STATES AND OUR PEOPLE STRONG. THAT IS A PRINCIPAL THAT HELPED US BECOME THE MA -- MAJORITY PARTY. WE HAVE TO BE THE PARTY OF ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE MIDWEST AND THE SOUTH. I OFTEN SAID I'M NOT A WALL STREET REPUBLICAN. I'M A MAIN STREET REPUBLICAN. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT MANY OF US BECAME REPUBLICANS NOT BECAUSE WE FAVORED A PARTICULAR PERSON ON THE ECONOMIC SCALE, BUT BECAUSE WE BELIEVED THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. WE BELIEVE THAT MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN AND THAT'S ALL IT MEANS AND NOTHING BUT AND SHOULD NEVER MEAN ANYTHING BUT THAT. PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHTS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION. WE WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT TIME-TESTED IDEA THAT WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES IS OUR GREAT STRENGTH AND THAT OUR FREEDOMS ARE BUILT UPON THE STRENGTH OF OUR FAMILIES AND IF WE HAVE WEAK FAMILIES, WE CAN NEVER HAVE A STRONG NATION. THAT BROUGHT MANY OF US TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WILL KEEP US THERE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND WHO IS A TEACHNER ARKANSAS NAMED MARTHA. MARTHA ON THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS 2005 ALMOST EXACTLY TWO YEARS AGO THIS WEEK HAVING DECIDED THAT A LOT OF HER KIDS SIMPLY JUST DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR FREEDOM DECIDED SHE WOULD TRY AN EXPERIMENT ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. WHAT MARTHA DID WAS TOOK ALL OF THE DESKS OUT OF HER CLASSROOM, EVERY DESK REMOVE FRIDAY THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. THE KIDS CAME IN TO AN EMPTY CLASS. THEY CAME IN AND SAID WHERE ARE THE DESKS? SHE SAID YOU DON'T GET A DESK UNTIL YOU CAN TELL YOU HOW TO EARN ONE. THE KIDS SAID WELL, I GUESS WE HAVE TO MAKE GOOD GRADES. SHE SAID YOU NEED TO MAKE GOOD GRADES, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU GET A DESK. >> SOME SAID IT'S OUR BEHAVIOR. WE HAVE TO BEHAVE AND YOU GIVE US A DESK. >> SHE SAID YOU BETTER BEHAVE, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU GET A DESK. SECOND PERIOD CAME AND THEY CAME IN AND STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND THE THIRD PERIOD OF SAME THING. BY LUNCH, ALL THE KIDS CALLED THEIR PARENTS AND SAID SHE LOST HER MIND. SHE TOOK THE DESKS OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. WE HAVE FOUR NETWORK AFFILIATED TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL FOUR HAD CAMERA CREWS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AT NOON TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS TEACHER WHO HAD TAKEN ALL THE DESKS AND WOULDN'T LET THE KIDS HAVE A PLACE TO SIT. SHE HELD THE GROUND UNTIL THE LAST PERIOD. THEY FILED IN AND LOOKED AROUND WITH NO DESKS AND THE BUZZ IS WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. SHE HAS GONE CRAZY. THE KIDS CAME IN AND STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND SHE SAID ALL DAY I HAVE BEEN ASKING TO YOU ME HOW YOU GET A DESK AND NONE OF YOU FIGURED IT OUT. SHE SAID I GUESS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. WITH THAT, MARTHA WALKED OVER TO THE DOOR OF HER CLASSROOM AND SHE OPENED THE DOOR. IN WALKED 27 VETERANS AND EVERY ONE COMING IN CARRYING A SCHOOL DESK. THEY PLACED THOSE DESKS IN ROWS AND WHEN THEY FINISHED PLACING THEM AND SETTING THEM UP FOR THE CLASS, THEY STOOD OVER AGAINST THE WALL AS IF AT ATTENTION. MARTHA WAS SAYING TO THE STUDENTS, GUYS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN YOUR DESK AFTER ALL BECAUSE THESE GUYS ALREADY DID. [APPLAUSE] MARTHA TOLD THEM THAT EVERY DAY YOU COME IN HERE AND SIT IN THESE DESKS, I WANT YOU TO NEVER FORGET IT MAY BE FREE TO YOU, BUT IT WASN'T TO THESE GUYS AND SOME OF THEIR FRIEND WHO IS DIDN'T COME BACK. SHE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING I THINK EVERY STUDENT OUGHT TO GROW UP UNDERSTANDING. WE ARE SO BLESSED TO LIVE IN THIS GREAT LAND, BUT OUR FREEDOM WAS NOT FREE. IT WAS COSTLY. IT WILL BE COSTLY IN THE FUTURE. THE GREATEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS TO BE LIKE THAT BEFORE US AND TO REALIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT IT AND TO PRESERVE IT, BUT THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION IN AS GOOD OF SHAPE AS WE FOUND IT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY HAS GOT TO DO TO MORE THAN LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE. LEADERSHIP HAS GOT TO LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE GOING AND MAKE SURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION COMING UP, THE NEXT GENERATION THAT IS PERHAPS NOT EVEN BORN YET HAS A BETTER AMERICA THAN THE GREAT WE INHERITED AND THE FOR WHICH WE ARE INCREDIBLY RESPONSIBLE AND HAD BETTER BE GRATEFUL TO AN ALMIGHTY GOD FOR. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. >> FORMER",2015-11-07 17:24:46,2007-08-24,Indianapolis,Indiana

[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] >> THERE WAS A COUPLE IN MY CHURCH, THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED 72 YEARS. I SAID WHAT IS THE SECRET? IT WAS INCREDIBLE. HE LOOKED AT ME WITH THIS TWINKLE IN HIS EYE, WHEN WE GOT MARRIED THE PREACHER SAID, KEEPS BARKING. HE WAS 93 YEARS OLD. I THOUGHT HE WAS PRICELESS. GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS. >> GOOD TO SEE THE GOVERNOR. >> I HEARD YOU MIGHT BE HERE AND I HAD TO BE ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR. >> YOU REMEMBER MY HUSBAND, THE TRUCK DRIVER. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE MEXICAN TRUCKING SITUATION. >> I AM HORRIFIED BY IT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME DOT REQUIREMENTS. >> I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. MY THOUGHT WAS, THE MEXICAN TRUCKS BRING IT TO THE BORDER, SO WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO SAY? >> WE HAVE A LOT OF TRUCKING COMPANIES IN OUR STATE. IT IS A BIG TRUCKING CENTER. I AM PRETTY SENSITIVE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COMES IN. IT IS TOUGH. THEY REALLY GO THROUGH IT. AND THEN TO HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FLEET OF TRUCKS COME IN. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. IT WAS NOT MY FAULT. >> I KNOW IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT. >> BUT WE ARE GOING TO FIX-IT. >> CAN I ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE? YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST ABOUT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SUBSIDIZING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUT YOU HAVE NOT TALKED VERY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW BIG THAT PROGRAM MIGHT BE AND ALSO WHERE THAT MONEY WOULD COME FROM. I WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT SUBJECT AND IS TO BE TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. >> I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG IT WILL BE UNTIL WE CAN DO DEFINITIVE STUDIES. I THINK THE KEY THING IS ENERGY INDEPENDENCE THAT COMES FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND SOUND APPROACHES, BUT PART OF THAT HAS TO HAPPEN BY CHANGING THE TAX STRUCTURE SO WE CREATE INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES TO TAKE THE RISK TO DO THAT, WHICH WERE NOT DOING. WE ARE DESTROYING BUSINESSES FROM MAKING THE ATTEMPT BY HAVING A TAX HIRE THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD. >> AS FAR AS SUBSIDIES FOR OIL COMPANIES, THAT TYPE OF THING, WOULD YOU SHIFT ANY OF THAT TO SUBSIDIZING COME UP WITH THAT MONEY INTO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT? >> SUBSIDIES, GIVE THEM THE FREE MARKET ACCESS THAT WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW IN THE TAX SYSTEM, CAPITAL GAINS, INHERITANCE, IT TAXES EVERYTHING. IF YOU TAKE THE TAX OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PUT ON THE RETAIL LEVEL DUPUY CHANGE HOW WE CAN GO AND MAKE THOSE IN NEED -- MEANS NECESSARY TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. >> QUICKLY, YOUR POSITION ON A NATIONAL CAP ON CARBON OR AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. >> AND STILL VERY OPEN ABOUT IT.

WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT UNLESS THERE IS A TRUE TRANSITION THAT NECESSITATES IT. >> GREAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING. HOW YOU DOING? >> I CAME DOWN WITH LEUKEMIA LAST YEAR, SO HEALTHCARE IS A BIG ISSUE FOR ME. I AM IN REMISSION NOW, BUT I AM STILL GOING THROUGH CHEMO, CONSOLIDATION THERE BE. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU PLAN ON DOING WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM >> FIRST OF ALL I THINK THE KEY THING IS TO CHANGE IT FROM AN INTERVENTION SYSTEM WHERE WE WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ARE CATASTROPHICALLY ILL -- THE SYSTEM IS UPSIDE DOWN. SECONDLY MAKE IT MORE CONSUMER CONTROLLED, NOT INSURANCE COMPANIES, NOT GOVERNMENT AND NOT EMPLOYER CONTROLLED. WE NEED TO HAVE REALLY THE ACCESS TO YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE NOT AN INSURANCE COMPANY WHO HAVE A VESTED INTEREST, NOT AN EMPLOYER WHO CAN FIRE YOU AND LEAVE YOU WITHOUT COVERAGE. COVERAGE NEEDS TO FOLLOW YOU, NOT EMPLOYERS, NOT INSURANCE COMPANIES AND NOT GOVERNMENT. THE REAL CHALLENGE FOR US IS THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE WHERE WE ARE PUTTING -- WERE PUTTING THREE THINGS IN ORDER, PREVENTION, CARES WHEN IT IS CAPABLE AND MANAGING DISEASE WHEN IT ISN'T. WE DON'T DO THAT NOW, THEY BASICALLY WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ARE FALLING APART, AND WE SAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? IN MY STATE, WEEK ENDED COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES FOR MAMMOGRAPHIES, PROSTATE CANCER. WE MADE BREAST CANCER, MAMMOGRAMS AND PROSTATE CANCER EXAMS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE BECAUSE IF YOU DO THESE GREENINGS IT COSTS LESS MONEY THAN TO DEAL WITH STAGE FOR CANCER. WE GAVE PEOPLE INCENTIVES TO STOP SMOKING SAID THEY WOULD TAKE BETTER CARE OF THEMSELVES. IT IS THERE DECISION, BUT FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, FOR BETTER PERSONAL HEALTH DECISIONS. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT CLEARLY CAN BE DONE THAT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN COVERAGE, BUT COVERS THE YOU OWN, NOT THAT SOMEBODY ELSE ONS THAT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO AND WHAT YOU CAN DO. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> I'M GLAD YOU CAN TONIGHT. >> WE ARE JUST SO THANKFUL FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID FOR US. >> IT HAS TO BE TOUGH BEING A COLLEGE REPUBLICAN. >> IT IS ONE OF THE MOST PERVERSE POLITICALLY. WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF MEMBERS COMING IN. SO IT IS REALLY GOOD. IT IS A GREAT PLACE FOR OPEN DISCUSSION. >> I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT. >> SHE WAS UP UNTIL 2:00 IN THE MORNING. >> SHIAS THE MOST WONDERFUL DOG NAMED DAISY.

WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE BOTH YOUNG AMERICANS AND REALLY GENERATIONS WHO ARE RETIRING THAT ARE HEALTHY AND YOUNGER, WHAT DO WE DO WITH THEM TO KIND OF GET THEM INTO SERVICE AND GET THEM BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY? >> I'M NOT READY TO SAY WE OUGHT TO HAVE MANDATORY COMMUNITY SERVICE. >> SOMETIMES THERE IS A FALSE DEBATE BETWEEN SERVICE AND MANDATORY SERVICE. >> IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT A PERSON WITH LIVE OFF THE BODIES OF THIS COUNTRY AND NOT FEEL OBLIGATED, THROUGH SOME TYPE OF SERVICE. OUT OF SHEER GUILT AND SHAME, THE OUGHT TO DO IT. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS, IF THERE IS AN INCENTIVE, 65 AND OLDER, SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF A THEIR TAX-FREE INCOME, TOTAL VOLUNTEER. >> SOMEONE PROPOSED BASICALLY ALLOWING RETIREES TO GET AN EDUCATION AWARD. >> THAT IS A GOOD IDEA, SAID THEY WOULD PASS ON TO THEIR GRANDCHILD. >> BASICALLY THEY WOULD EARN IT. THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO HELP THEM OUT. I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE IT IN THE CAR. >> I AM A SUBSCRIBER. >> IF I HAVE IT, I WILL BRING IT TO YOU. THANK YOU. CAN I GET A QUICK PICTURE? >> YOU BET YOU CAN. WHAT YOU GUYS EAT THAT MAKES USE ATOLL? >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SPEED HUCKABEE. >> PART OF IT WAS RIGHT AFTER 9/11.

LET'SVILLE AARP BOOTS. >> THERE IS NO BETTER SALESMAN FOR PUBLIC SERVICE THAN THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. >> ARE YOU GOING TO BE TALKING TONIGHT? >> I THINK SO. I AM, A GREAT. >> WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEETING AND TAKE YOUR A ROUNDER SOMETHING. >> I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE GUYS BEING HERE. HEY MICHAEL. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

HE WAS ON THE BOARD OF ADVISERS FOR THAT. >> I AM READING A BOOK ON LINCOLN RIGHT NOW. IT IS A REALLY NEAT BOOK. IT IS BEEN OUT FOR A YEAR OR TWO.

WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON THAT? >> INSTEAD OF HAVING ALL THE I.O.U.'S? >> I AM OPEN TO THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE SOME OF THE SYSTEM RULES.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?201031-1/clinton-health-care-proposal,Clinton Health Care Proposal,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"THAT BEHIND HIM AND >> NOW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON IN DES MOINES I WAS HONORED PLANS FOR CHANGING THE NATION'S HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. FROM ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE, IT IS ABOUT 45 MINUTES. I AM HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY EDGAR LOANS MEDICAL CENTER. FOR MANY YEARS, AS YOU'VE HEARD, THIS CENTER HAS BEEN PROVIDING CARE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY, INCLUDING MANY OF THOSE MOST IN NEED. AND I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER PLACE TO DISCUSS AMERICA'S HEALTH-CARE CRISIS THEN THE MEDICAL CENTER THAT CONFRONTS THE CONSEQUENCES EVERY SINGLE DAY. I WANT TO THANK JODI JENNER, BROADLAWNS PRESIDENT AND CEO ALONG WITH THE BOARD AND STAFF OF THIS FINE MEDICAL CENTER. I WANT TO THANK LEEZA BECHTEL, A PROUD NURSE, ALONG WITH HER COLLEAGUES TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE DOORS HERE, SEEKING HELP AND SUPPORT. AND I WANT TO THANK SUSAN KERSTEN, THE CHIEF NURSING EXECUTIVE. I AM A STRONG, STRONG SUPPORTER OF NURSES AND I APPRECIATE THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO EXPANDING THEIR ROLE, BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE OF HEALTHCARE, AS I SEE IT. AND TO THE ENTIRE STAFF OF BROADLAWNS, THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE FRONT LINES. THE STATISTICS THAT YOU HEARD ARE JUST REALLY A SNAPSHOT. SO MANY OF THE PATIENTS HERE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET ELSEWHERE. AND I HEAR THEIR STORIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, AND I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD THEM HERE IN IOWA. I WANT TO START BY TELLING YOU ABOUT THE JUDY ROSE, WHOM I MET LAST MONTH IN DUBUQUE, ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND JOHN. BACK IN 2001, JOHN LOST HIS JOB OF 30 YEARS WHEN THE PLANT WHERE HE WORKED CLOSED WHICH JUST ONE DAY'S NOTICE. AND SO, JUDY AND JOHN LOST NOT ONLY JOHN'S JOB, THEY LOST THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, JUDY WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER THANKFULLY A SPECIAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAM STARTED DURING MY HUSBAND'S ADMINISTRATION TOOK CARE OF HER TREATMENT AND SHE RECOVERED, BUT THEN IN 2003, JOHN HAD A HEART ATTACK. HE SPENT HOURS IN SURGERY AND WAS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT [CRYING] FORTUNATELY HE SURVIVED, BUT WHEN THE BILLS CAME, THEIR LUCK RAN OUT. THE COST OF JOHN SCARED WAS SO HIGH THEY HAD TO SELL THE HOME THEY HAD LIVED IN FOR 30 YEARS. THAT IS THE TRAGEDY AT THE HEART OF OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. THE DEVASTATION WHEN ONE STROKE OF BAD LUCK THAN DOES A LIFETIME OF HARD WORK. THAT FEELING OF BEING RIGHT ON THE EDGE THAT EATS AWAY NOT JUST OF THE 47 MILLION WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, BUT MANY OF THE 250 MILLION WHO DO. IT IS THE HEARTBREAK YOU FEEL WHEN YOUR SPOUSE ASKS, CAN WE AFFORD MY PILLS THIS MONTH? AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. WHEN YOU ARE SICK CHILD ASKS, CAN I SEE THE DOCTOR, AND YOU CAN'T BEAR TO ANSWER. WHEN YOU ASK YOUR DOCTOR, WILL MY INSURANCE PAY FOR THAT, AND FROM THE LOOK ON HER FACE, YOU ARE READY KNOW THE ANSWER. IT IS WHAT THIS LED TO SO MANY PEOPLE AND SO MANY PLACES OVER SOME MANY YEARS TO ASK ME, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT HEALTHCARE FOR AMERICA? AND THEN MORE QUIETLY, AND WHAT MY GOING TO DO ABOUT HEALTHCARE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY? WELL, I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT THIS NATION HAD AN ANSWER. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE I BELIEVE AMERICA IS READY FOR CHANGE, BECAUSE LIKE YOU, I REMEMBER HOW WE ENTERED THE 21ST CENTURY, FILLED WITH HOPE, READY TO SEIZE THE PROMISE OF A MORE PROSPEROUS NATION AND A MORE PEACEFUL WORLD. BUT LIKE YOU, I HAVE SEEN HOW THESE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE DONE JUST THE OPPOSITE, WE HAVE GOTTEN MIRED IN OTHER COUNTRIES CIVIL WAR, A WAR WITHOUT A MILITARY SOLUTION, WE HAVE FAILED TO INVEST IN OUR FUTURE AND OUR SCHOOLS TECHNOLOGY, SCIENCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND WE ARE FALLING BEHIND. COSTS ARE RISING AND WAGES ARE LAGGING. PREMIUMS HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED, UP 98% SINCE 2000. AND HALF OF ALL PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES IN AMERICA ARE CAUSED BY MEDICAL BILLS. IF THERE WAS EVER A NEED FOR CHANGE IN AMERICA, IT IS NOW. AND IF THERE WAS EVER A MOMENT TO DO WHAT AMERICA DOES BEST TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE, THIS IS IT. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE , WHERE THERE WAS TEDDY ROOSEVELT BUSTING THE TRUST OR AT THE ARE SEEKING TO END ELDERLY POVERTY, WHERE THERE WAS PRESIDENT TRUMAN SENDING THE GIS TO COLLEGE AND INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, OR PRESIDENT JOHNSON ENSURING HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AMERICANS IN THEIR GOLDEN YEARS AND TO REPORT FOR GO WHEN THE TIME FOR CHANGE CAME WE WERE NOT AFRAID, WE DID NOT LOOK AWAY, WE CAME TOGETHER AND REMADE AMERICA STRONGER, MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE FAIR. WE ARE AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A NATION OF OPPORTUNITY, A NATION THAT BELIEVES IN GIVING EVERYONE A CHANCE TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR OWN LIVES. AND OF COURSE WE BELIEVE IN RESPONSIBILITY. BUT WHEN FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING, WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE BASIC NECESSITIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO SEIZE THESE OPPORTUNITIES, WE DON'T LEAVE THEM TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS. INSTEAD OF AN ERA OF OPPORTUNITY , WE HAVE HAD A.U. ARE ON YOUR OWN ERA. SO MANY PEOPLE, FAMILIES WHO CAN'T AFFORD HEALTHCARE, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD COLLEGE, SENIORS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO RETIRE, IT IS LIKE THEY ARE INVISIBLE TO THE PRESIDENT, LIKE HE HAS LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH THEM WELL I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN AMERICA SHOULD BE INVISIBLE AND I BELIEVE EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION, EVERY WORKER SHOULD HAVE A JOB WITH GOOD WAGES AND GOOD BENEFITS, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT, AND TODAY AS WE STRIVE FOR A NEW BEGINNING TO THE 21ST CENTURY, I BELIEVE EVERYONE, EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD SHOULD HAVE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IN AMERICA. WE SHOULD DO IT -- [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE COMING IN THIS NEW ECONOMY, WHEN PEOPLE MOVE JOBS MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE SHOULD MOVE WITH THEM. WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE DOCTORS AND NURSES, NOT INSURANCE COMPANY EMPLOYEES, SHOULD BE CALLING THE SHOTS ON PATIENT CARE. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE SOLVING THE HEALTH-CARE CRISIS IS KEY TO ENSURING AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET PLACE. WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE, IN A NATION WHERE WE SPLIT THE ATOM, SENT A MAN TO THE MOON, MAP THE HUMAN GENOME, WHERE WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST PROMISING TREATMENTS AND CURES AVAILABLE, HARD WORKING PEOPLE SHOULD GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THERE IS SICK. AND WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BECAUSE WE CAN NO LONGER TOLERATE THE INJUSTICE OF A SYSTEM THAT SHUTS OUT NEARLY ONE IN SIX AMERICANS. ULTIMATELY, THIS IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AT THE PEOPLE, AND WHAT WE STAND FOR. WE CAN TALK ALL WE WANT ABOUT FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY, ABOUT LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, BUT WHAT DOES ALL THAT MEAN TO A MOTHER OR A FATHER WHO CAN'T TAKE A SICK CHILD TO THE DOCTOR, TO SOMEONE WHO CAN'T TAKE THE JOB OF HIS DREAMS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT OFFER HEALTHCARE, TO A FAMILY FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY OR LOSING THEIR HOME BECAUSE THEIR MEDICAL BILLS WERE JUST TOO HIGH? WE ARE THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, AND WE SPEND RIGHT NOW MORE ON HEALTHCARE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD, $2 TRILLION A YEAR, BUT WE ARE RANKED 31ST IN LIFE EXPECTANCY AND 40TH IN CHILD MORTALITY CRAIG NOTE EACH YEAR 18,000 PEOPLE DIE IN AMERICA BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE. LET ME REPEAT THAT. HERE IN AMERICA PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET THE CARE THEY NEEDED WHEN THEY WERE SICK. AT THE SAME TIME, OVER THE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS, THE SPECIAL INTERESTS HAVE HAD A FIELD DAY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND HARD-WORKING FAMILIES. JUST LIKE IN OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM, IT DOES NOT ALLOW MEDICARE TO USE ITS PURCHASING POWER TO NEGOTIATE LOWER DRUG PRICES, SO EVERY YEAR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GO STRAIGHT FROM THE POCKETS OF FAMILIES TO THE PROFITS OF DRUG COMPANIES. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE, IT IS INTOLERABLE AND IT IS TIME TO PUT AN END TO IT. IT IS TIME FOR IS TO COME TOGETHER AND START LIVING UP TO OUR OWN VALUES, TO PROVIDE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN AND I INTEND TO BE THE PRESIDENT WHO ACCOMPLISHES THAT GOAL FINALLY FOR OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] NOW, AS YOU MAY KNOW, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR HEALTHCARE FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS. STARTING AS FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS WHERE I HEADED A TASK FORCE TO IMPROVE RURAL HEALTHCARE AND MUST MEMORABLY OF COURSE BACK IN THE EARLY 1990'S, AND I STILL HAVE THE SCARS TO SHOW FROM THAT EXERCISE. WHAT I HAVE ALSO LEARNED SOME VALUABLE LESSONS THAT HAVE SHAPED HOW I APPROACH HEALTHCARE REFORM TODAY. FIRST, I THINK WE HAVE ALL LEARNED THAT AMERICA NEEDS TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL AMERICANS. THE LAST 12 YEARS HAVE SHOWN HOW LEFT ON THEIR OWN, THIS CRISIS AND THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO IT, AND PEOPLE FROM ALL CORNERS OF OUR ECONOMY WILL SEE OUR SITUATION DETERIORATES. A GROWING NUMBER OF CEOS AND UNION LEADERS ARE COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY AGREE THAT NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME TO RENEW THE NATIONAL CALL FOR QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. GOING TO ANDY STERN, THE PRESIDENT OF SEIU STANDS WITH LEE SCOTT, THE PRESIDENT OF WAL-MART AND THEY BOTH DEMAND HEALTHCARE REFORM THAT COVERS EVERYONE, YOU KNOW WE ARE READY FOR CHANGE. SECOND, I LEARNED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR CURRENT COVERAGE WANTS ASSURANCES THAT THEY CAN KEEP IT. PART OF OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD, AND WE SHOULD BUILD ON IT. PART IS BROKEN, AND WE SHOULD FIX IT. THE FIRST RULE OF MADISON IS DUE NO HARM, AND WE WILL DO NO HARM TO THE PARTS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT ARE WORKING. INSTEAD WE WILL BUILD ON THEM. THAT MEANS NOT JUST EXPANDING COVERAGE BUT ALSO CUTTING COSTS AND IMPROVING QUALITY, SO THAT WE WILL HAVE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AND BETTER HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. BECAUSE WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THOSE WHO HAVE INSURANCE, AS WELL OF AS THOSE WHO DO NOT. THAT IS WHY I STARTED MY PATH TO THIS PLACE HERE AT BROADLAWNS, WITH A SERIES OF HEALTH CARE SPEECHES. I GAVE A SPEECH ON LOWERING HEALTH-CARE COSTS, WHICH HELPS EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM. AND I GAVE A SPEECH ON IMPROVING QUALITY, WHICH ALSO HELPS EVERYONE. THIRD, I LEARNED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PRESENT A PLAN THAT IS CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND. TODAY'S PLAN IS SIMPLER, GET SYLLABLED. NOW I KNOW, MY REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS WILL TRY TO EQUATE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AMERICANS WITH A GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTHCARE WELL, DON'T LET THEM FOOL US AGAIN. THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT RUN, THERE WILL BE NO NEW BUREAUCRACIES. DUU CAN KEEP THE DOCTORS YOU KNOW AND TRUST, YOU KEEP THE INSURANCE YOU HAVE IF YOU LIKE IT. BUT THIS PLAN EXPANDS PERSONAL CHOICE AND INCREASES COMPETITION TO KEEP COSTS DOWN. FOR IT, I LEARNED ABOUT HOW TO BUILD THE NATIONAL CONSENSUS YOU NEED TO GET HEALTHCARE PASSED. MY PLAN IS THE RESULT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH MANY PEOPLE, DOCTORS AND NURSES, HOSPITALS ADMINISTRATORS, EMPLOYERS COMEDIANS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AMERICA'S FAMILIES, WHO ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW. I HAVE BEEN ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN DOING A LOT OF LISTENING, HAVING SPENT SIX YEARS IN THE SENATE I KNOW THAT FIXING HEALTHCARE WILL REQUIRE POLITICAL WILL TO GET THE VOTES WE NEED. AND IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT FOR CHANGE, A SOLID NATIONAL CONSENSUS FOR REFORM THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE ATTACKS OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS, AND I WILL WORK TO BUILD THE MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT MY CAMPAIGN AND AS YOUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE IN THE END, CHANGE IS JUST THE WORD UNLESS YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THESE ARE NEW TIMES AND THIS IS A NEW PLAN, AND WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHCARE REFORM I BELIEVE I HAVE EXACTLY THE EXPERIENCE WE NEED TO GET IT DONE IN MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] WHILE I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN 1994, I DID NOT GIVE UP. I CONTINUE THE FIGHT. I WORKED TO EXPAND COVERAGE STEP-BY-STEP, PERSON BY PERSON. I BEGAN WORKING TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE HEALTHCARE FOR CHILDREN, HELPING TO CREATE THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW IT AS THE HAWKEYE PROGRAM HERE AND IOWA. THAT PROGRAM PROVIDES INSURANCE FOR MORE THAN 6 MILLION LOW-INCOME CHILDREN, AND I WORKED TO CREATE THE VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. TO DATE SHOW THAT IMMUNIZATIONS ARE AN ALL-TIME HIGH KERDVILLE I WORK TO INSURE THAT NEW PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE TESTED, NOT JUST FOR ADULTS, BUT FOR CHILDREN TO, AND I WROTE LEGISLATION IN THE SENATE TO GET THAT ACCOMPLISHED TRICK OF BECAUSE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE BEST AND SAFEST TREATMENTS AND CURES AVAILABLE. I ALSO WORKED AS FIRST LADY TO INSURE THAT BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT WOULD BE COVERED BY MEDICAID. AND I HELPED ESTABLISH THE COMMISSION THAT RECOGNIZE GULF WAR ILLNESS AS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IS FOR OUR VETS IS SERVED IN THE FIRST GULF WAR, AND WE BEGAN TO ADDRESS IT. IN THE SENATE I'VE WORKED TO EXPAND HEALTHCARE TO OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM FOR GO BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MANY OF OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED TO FIGHT IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, DID NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THERE WERE ACTIVATED. I AM PROUD OF THE LEGISLATION I PASSED TO ADDRESS THAT GLARING PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING MORE GENERALLY TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE FOR VETERANS BECAUSE IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT SOME MANY SERVICE MEMBERS ARE RETURNING HOME AND BEING TOLD TO TAKE THE NUMBER AND WAIT IN LINE FOR THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED. AND I HAVE PASSED WHAT IS CALLED THE HEROES HOME LEGISLATION THAT HELPS THOSE AFFECTED BY TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND SUPPORTS THEIR FAMILIES. I AM FIGHTING TO IMPROVE CARE FOR OUR SENIORS, TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY EMPOWERING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH DRUG COMPANIES AND BY ALLOWING IMPORTS OF OUR DRUGS FROM CANADA AT LOWER PRICES FOR COE AND FINALLY, FOLLOWING HORRIFIC SPACE OF 9/11, I FOUGHT THE EPA AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WHEN THEY CLAIMED THAT THE AIR AND GROUND ZERO WAS SAVE, SAVE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AND EMERGENCY WORKERS, SAVE FOR OUR CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING TRADES WORKERS, SAFE FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND ARE VOLUNTEERS. IT WAS NOT. SO I FOUGHT FOR HEALTHCARE FOR ALL OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THE WORKERS, THE VOLUNTEERS AND RESIDENTS WHO HAVE GOTTEN SICK AND SOME HAVE EVEN DIED. I WILL KEEP FIGHTING TO PROTECT THEM UNTIL THEY HAVE THE CARE THEY NEED. I KNOW THERE REFORMING HEALTHCARE TAKES A CONSENSUS FOR CHANGE. THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING, A BUILDING THAT CONSENSUS VOTE BY VOTE. WORKING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, TO GET MY COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE AISLE TO JOIN OUR CAUSE. UNFORTUNATELY BACK IN 1993 AND '94, TO MANY OF OUR OPPONENTS ADOPTED A STRATEGY THAT AMOUNTED TO JUST SAY NO. THEY SAID NO, NOT JUST TO OUR HEALTHCARE PLAN, BUT ANY HEALTHCARE PLAN, AND THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT EVEN TRIED. IN FACT THE PRESIDENT'S MOST NEWSWORTHY CONTRIBUTION ON HEALTHCARE WAS HIS RECENT THREAT TO VETO COVERAGE FOR LOW-INCOME CHILDREN. WELL, TODAY AMERICANS ARE IMPATIENT. WE HAVE SEEN THAT DOING NOTHING MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE. WE HAVE GONE FROM 39 MILLION UNINSURED IN 1994 TO 47 MILLION TODAY, FROM SPENDING 14% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT FOR HEALTHCARE TO SPENDING 16%, AND NOW WE ARE SPENDING 50% MORE PER PERSON THAN THE NEXT HIGHEST SPENDING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, SWITZERLAND, WHICH HAS HIGH QUALITY AND GOOD OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE THERE. SO TODAY WE ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY AND COVERING FEWER PEOPLE AND TO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES ARE PAYING THE PRICE. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO ACT AND SO OF THE QUESTION IS THAT UNION LEADERS AND EMPLOYERS CAN COME TOGETHER, IF THE MAYO CLINIC HAS JUST DONE AN EXTENSIVE SURVEY INCLUDING 400 EXPERTS COMING TO A REPORT, URGING THAT WE HAVE HEALTHCARE REFORM, HAVE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES CAN WORK TOGETHER ON HEALTHCARE, IF DOCTORS, NURSES, PATIENTS, HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS, CEOS, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN AGREE IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE, THEN WHY CAN'T WASHINGTON? I BELIEVE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN CHANGE WASHINGTON BY STICKING TO OUR PRINCIPLES AND REACHING OUT TO FIND COMMON GROUND. AND MARIKA FACES A CHOICE, CONTINUE THE STATUS QUO AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LOSE COVERAGE, OR CHANGE OUR SYSTEM TO COVER ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS AMERICA'S CHOICE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HEALTHCARE. AMERICA'S JOYCE TO TACKLE PROBLEMS OF COST, QUALITY AND COVERAGE AND IT SHOULD BE OF EVERY AMERICAN'S CHOICE TO HAVE THE KIND OF HEALTHCARE THAT THEY WANT. THAT CHOICE IS AT THE HEART OF MY PLAN. I CALLED MY PLAN THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN. THIS PLAN IS THE RESULT OF IT THROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE HEALTH-CARE CRISIS, STARTING WITH THE REALITY THAT ROUGHLY EIGHT IN TEN OF THE UNINSURED, AND THOSE WHO COME TO THE DOORS OF THIS MEDICAL CENTER, COME FROM WORKING FAMILIES, MOST MIDDLE-CLASS AND FAMILIES EARNING BETWEEN $25,075,000 A YEAR ARE THE FASTEST-GROWING GROUP OF THE UNINSURED. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE YOUNGER ADULTS, AGES 25 TO 34 AND OLDER ADULTS, AGES 45 TO 64 ARE THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSING INSURANCE COVERAGE. INDICATING IT IS HARD TO OBTAIN COVERAGE WHEN YOU FIRST START OUT IN THE WORLD OF WORK AND HARDER TO MAINTAIN IT AS YOU AGE , AND EXPERIENCED HEALTH PROBLEMS. FINALLY, EMPLOYERS SPONSOR HEALTH INSURANCES ON THE DECLINE. IN 2007, 60% OF EMPLOYERS OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS, DOWN FROM 69% SIX YEARS AGO. THIS IS AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE CHANGING JOBS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EVER BEFORE. MANY AMERICANS ARE NOW SELF-EMPLOYED, RUNNING BUSINESSES OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND THEY STRUGGLE TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. MY PLAN TAKES ALL OF THESE REALITIES INTO ACCOUNT. AND ADDRESSES THEM HEAD ON. THIS PLAN IS NOT JUST MY PLAN, IT IS THE PRODUCT OF HUNDREDS OF DISCUSSIONS WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS AND UNION HALLS, HANS AND BUSINESSES ACROSS AMERICA, AND GOING FORWARD IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND THEN AS PRESIDENT I AM GOING TO KEEP REACHING OUT, ASKING FOR IDEAS, NOT JUST IN IMPROVING AND ENACTING THE PLAN BUT IN THE DAILY WORK TO MAKE IT A REALITY. NOW HERE IS HOW THIS PLAN WOULD WORK. IF YOU HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE YOU LIKE, NOTHING CHANGES. YOU CAN KEEP THAT INSURANCE. IF YOU LIKE THE DOCTOR YOU HAVE, IF YOU CAN KEEP SAYING THAT DR.. IF YOU LIKE THE HOSPITAL WHERE YOU RECEIVE CARE, YOU CAN KEEP RECEIVING CARE AT THAT HOSPITAL. IF, HOWEVER, YOU DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR YOU DON'T LIKE THE INSURANCE YOU HAVE, YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM THE SAME WIDE VARIETY OF PRIVATE PLANS THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CHOOSE FROM. I AM CALLING IT A HEALTH CHOICES MENU. SO ESSENTIALLY, THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTHCARE PLAN BECOMES THE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN. THE IDEA HERE IS SIMPLE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME ARE REOF HEALTHCARE CHOICES AND BENEFITS AS THE SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES THEY ELECT. [APPLAUSE] YOU WILL ALSO HAVE AS ONE OF THOSE CHOICES A PUBLIC PLAN, JUST LIKE MEDICARE IS A PUBLIC PLAN, YOU'LL HAVE ACCESS TO A PUBLIC PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE A STABLE, COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PRIVATE INSURANCE IF THAT IS YOUR CHOICE. MY PLAN DOES NOT CREATE A SINGLE NEW GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT, AGENCY OR BUREAUCRACY. IS NOT A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE, IT IS A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT PROVIDES MORE CHOICES. IF YOU ARE AN EMPLOYER, YOU CHOOSE WHICHEVER PLAN IS BEST FOR YOUR BUSINESS. IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL, YOU CHOOSE WHICHEVER PLAN IS BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, AND WE WILL PROVIDE TAX CREDITS TO INSURE YOU CAN PAY FOR IT. NOW WHETHER YOU KEEP THE INSURANCE YOU HAVE OR YOU CHOOSE ONE OF THE OPTIONS IN THE HEALTH JOYCE'S MENU, YOU WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING GUARANTEES. FIRST, YOU WILL NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OR RISK FACTORS. [APPLAUSE] INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST HIGH-RISK PATIENTS OR CHARGING EXORBITANT PREMIUMS TO SCREEN THEM OUT. SO WHETHER YOU ARE SICK IN THE PAST FOR A GENETIC TEST SHOWS YOU MAY GET SICK IN THE FUTURE, HE WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FINDING AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. [APPLAUSE] SECOND, YOUR COVERAGE WILL BE GUARANTEED. EIGHT YOU PAY YOUR PREMIUMS AND FOLLOW THE NEW RULES, YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO RENEW YOUR COVERAGE EACH YEAR AT A PRICE YOU CAN AFFORD, EVEN IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB, EVEN IF YOU DECIDE TO START YOUR OWN BUSINESS OR STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN FOR A FEW YEARS AGO THIRD, YOUR COVERAGE WILL BE AFFORDABLE. MY PLAN PROVIDES TAX CREDITS TO MAKE HEALTHCARE BOTH UNIVERSAL AND AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE. THESE NEW TAX CREDITS GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL NEVER PAY MORE THAN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME FOR YOUR PREMIUMS, NO MORE WORRYING THAT ONE VELEZ OR ONE TAX THAT WILL LEAD TO FINANCIAL RUIN FOR GO FOR IT, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN OPTION FOR COVERAGE THAT IS FULLY AFFORDABLE. I WILL REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE HEALTH CHOICES MENU 200 TAKE YOUR PLAN WITH YOU AS YOU MOVE FROM JOB TO JOB OR EVEN STATE TO STATE. KNOW EXACTLY HOW WILL ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE? WELL, IS GOING TO TAKE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. EVERYONE WITH A STAKE IN OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO STEP FORWARD AND DO THEIR PART. WHILE I WILL BE REQUIRING ALL AMERICANS TO HAVE HEALTHCARE, I WILL BE CALLING ON EMPLOYERS TO DO THEIR PART AS WELL. TODAY LARGE AMERICAN COMPANIES COMPETE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY AGAINST COMPANIES IN COUNTRIES THAT IMPOSE FAR LOWER HEALTH-CARE BURDENS ON EMPLOYERS. AND MANY OF OUR MANUFACTURERS ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR RETIREE HEALTH COMMITMENTS THAT OUR FOREIGN COMPETITORS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE. UNDER MY PLAN, LARGE COMPANIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO HELP PAY FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES' HEALTHCARE. THOSE THAT DO SO CAN SIMPLY MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT POLICIES IF THEY CHOOSE. THOSE THAT DON'T WILL NEED TO CONTRIBUTE FOR THE COST OF COVERING THEIR EMPLOYEES ON A SLIDING SCALE BASED ON THEIR SIZE AND AVERAGE WAGES. MY PLAN ALSO HELPS AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE BY PROVIDING A TAX CREDIT TO THOSE STRUGGLING WITH THE HIGH COST OF RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS. THESE COSTS ARE MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS TO COMPETE WITH THEIR FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS, WHO DON'T HAVE THESE KINDS OF COST. HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY COMPETE IF A CAR COMPANY LIKE GENERAL MOTORS PAYS $1,635 IN HEALTH-CARE COSTS PER CAR PRODUCED WILD TOYOTA IS ONLY PAYING TWO EDITED $15 PER CAR? AND THINK ABOUT THE RETIREES WHO RELY ON THESE BENEFITS TODAY. PEOPLE LET'S SET THAT LOWER WAGES OVER THE YEARS IN RETURN FOR THE PROMISE OF A SECURE RETIREMENT. THE TAX CREDIT I PROVIDE WILL HELP EMPLOYERS COVER CATASTROPHIC COSTS ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD, COSTS INCURRED BY A FEW RETIREES WITH THE MOST SEVERE HEALTH PROBLEMS. COST THAT CAN RUN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE PERSON. THIS RELIEF WILL BE A TEMPORARY MEASURE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF AGING BABY BOOMERS AND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE NOT JUST TO QUALIFYING PRIVATE SECTOR MANUFACTURERS, BUT THE STATES, TO HELP PAY RETIREE COSTS FOR TEACHERS, POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHERS. IN RETURN FOR THIS ASSISTANCE, COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO MODERNIZE THEIR PLANTS WITH INITIATIVE TO CUT WASTE AND IMPROVE QUALITY, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE USING THE TAX CREDITS TO ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVENESS AND SUPPORT THEIR WORKERS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE PLEADING TO MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOW THE ENGINE OF JOB CREATION IN AMERICA. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, SINCE 1990, COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN 20 EMPLOYEES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 80% OF THE ADDITIONAL NEW JOBS IN AMERICA. JOBS THAT OFTEN CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME SMALL BUSINESSES FACE HIGHER PREMIUMS BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED PURCHASING POWER, AND THEY TEND TO EMPLOY LOWER INCOME WORKERS. AS A RESULT THEY COVER FAR FEWER OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THAT COVERAGE IS ERODING BECAUSE SINCE 2000, THE PERCENTAGE OF SMALL BUSINESSES OFFERING BENEFITS HAS FALLEN FROM 57% TO 45%. NOW UNDER MY PLAN, WE WILL NOT REQUIRE SMALL BUSINESSES TO COVER EMPLOYEES. INSTEAD, WE WILL PROVIDE TAX CREDITS TO INSURE THAT MANY OF THEM DO. THESE TAX CREDITS WILL BE BASED ON SIZE AND AVERAGE WAGES, SO THE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN PROVIDE HEALTHCARE WITHOUT DESTROYING THEIR BOTTOM LINE. THIS CREDIT COULD BE AS HIGH AS 50% OF PREMIUMS FOR FIRMS WITH FEWER THAN 25 EMPLOYEES. IS A GOOD START THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LEADING THE WAY IN CREATING JOBS. MY GOAL IS FOR THEM TO CREATE NEW JOBS WITH GOOD HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AS WELL. GOVERNMENT ALSO NEEDS TO DO ITS PART TO PROMOTE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR GO UNDER MY PLAN, THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE TAX CREDITS TO INSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CAN AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO INVEST IN MEASURES TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND CUT COSTS THIS WILL RESULT IN DRAMATIC SAVINGS WHICH I WILL USE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE PART OF I OUTLINED MY COST-SAVING MEASURES IN A SPEECH BACK IN MAY. EYE PROSE DAY SEVEN-POINT PLAN TO SAVE $120 MILLION NATIONALLY EACH YEAR BY BRINGING OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. BIKE TRANSITIONING FROM OUTDATED PAPER RECORDS TO AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM, BY GETTING OUR CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT COSTS UNDER CONTROL, BY ALLOWING COMPANIES TO COMPETE FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BUSINESS AND MORE. LAST MONTH IN NEW HAMPSHIRE I LAID OUT MY AGENDA TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE QUALITY, A PLAN TO RAISE STANDARDS, EDUCATE PATIENTS AND HELP OUR DOCTORS AND NURSES PROVIDE WORLD-CLASS CARE. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE POLICIES CAN SAVE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY, HANDS MAKE AMERICANS HEALTHIER. INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL. MUCH LIKE DRIVERS IN THOSE STATES ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE THE CAR INSURANCE, ALL AMERICANS WILL HAVE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET AND KEEP HEALTH INSURANCE IN A SYSTEM WHERE INSURANCE WILL NOW BE AFFORDABLE. THE SAD REALITY IS THAT THE UNINSURED DON'T TO STRUGGLE WITH COSTS THEMSELVES, THEY IMPOSE COSTS ON THE REST OF US. IT IS A HIDDEN TAX. THE HIGH COST OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, THAT COULD BEEN PREVENTED BY A MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. BECAUSE OF UNPAID MEDICAL BILLS THAT LEADING INSURANCE COMPANIES TO RAISE RATES ON THE REST OF US. COVERING THESE INDIVIDUALS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF THESE HIDDEN TAXES. THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE AFFORDABLE COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE IS TO COVER EVERYONE, AND THAT IS THE CHOICE WE NEED FOR AMERICA. FINALLY, I WILL CALL ON DRUG COMPANIES AND INSURANCE COMPANIES TO DO THEIR PARTS AS WELL. IT IS TIME WE PUT PATIENTS, NOT DRUG COMPANIES AND INSURANCE COMPANIES, FIRST. THAT MEANS CHANGING THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. NAT CLEARLY WITH DRUG COMPANIES, WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO GET GENERIC DRUGS TO MARKET, INCLUDING THE NEW BIOLOGICS THAT ARE COMING INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE OFTEN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. WE DO HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE NEGOTIATION TO GET DRUG PRICES DOWN AND TO IMPORT FROM CANADA AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO US, BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER PAYS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOT OF THESE DRUGS THROUGH NIH GRANTS AND OTHER KINDS OF RESEARCH GRANTS. WE PAY FOR THE CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEN WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD, AND WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN TO REIGN THAT IN. IT ALSO MEANS -- [APPLAUSE] CHANGING THE WAY INSURANCE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS IN AMERICA. I WILL START BY BANNING INSURANCE CO. DISCRIMINATION. RIGHT NOW INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE FREE REIGN, TO CHERRY PICK THE HEALTHIEST PATIENTS AND SHOW THAT ANYONE THE SEEMS TO THEM LIKE A BAD RISK. INSURANCE COMPANIES SPEND $50 BILLION A YEAR ON THE LAVERTY CALCULATIONS AND SCHEMES TO FIGURE OUT HOW NOT TO INSURE PEOPLE. $50 BILLION TRYING TO SHUT OUT THOSE WHO NEED CARE THE MOST. AND EVERY DAY THEY DENY PEOPLE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OR THE RESULTS OF GENETIC TESTING. THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN DOWN THE ROAD, WITH ADVANCES IN GENETIC TESTING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US COULD WIND UP BEING BAD RISKS, BECAUSE GENETICALLY MOST OF US WILL PROBABLY SHOW WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SOMETHING. AND THEREFORE WE WILL BECOME UNINSURABLE. SO ONE OF THE URGENCY IS BEHIND THIS PLAN NOW IS THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS IT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED AND EXECUTED OVER DECADES NOW, WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF INCREASING NUMBERS OF AMERICANS IF THEY STICK WITH THE POLICIES THAT ELIMINATE OUR FELLOW CITIZENS. THIS LEGALIZED DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE SICKEST OF AMERICANS IS UNFAIR AND IMMORAL. AND DEFEATS ONE OF THE CENTRAL PURPOSES OF INSURANCE, WHICH IS TO SHARE RISKS. MY PLAN PUTS AN END TO THIS. IT FORCES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COMPETE BASED ON COST AND QUALITY, NOT HOW SKILLFULLY THEY CAN WEED OUT THE SICKEST PATIENTS. MY PLAN ALSO HAS A PREVENTION INITIATIVE, REQUIRING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TO PROMOTE WELLNESS, AS WELL AS TREATING ILLNESS AND PROVIDE EVERY AMERICAN WITH COMPREHENSIVE FOR THE -- PREVENTIVE CARE. TODAY WE PAY DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS TO TREAT DISEASES AND INJURIES, BUT NOT TO PREVENT THEM FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN FACT WE HAVE MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR DOCTORS TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY INSURANCE COMPANIES REIMBURSE PHYSICIANS. DIABETES CARE IS A PERFECTLY EXAMPLE. MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES WON'T PAY FOR A DIABETIC TO SEE A NUTRITIONIST, TO LEARN HOW WE EAT PROPERLY FOR A PODIATRIST TO GET THEIR FEET CHECKED BUT IF YOU WIND UP HAVING TO HAVE YOUR FOOT THE AMPUTATED FROM COMPLICATIONS DUE TO DIABETES, THE INSURANCE COMPANY WILL PAY FOR THAT. AND IF YOU ASK WHY, INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL TELL YOU, THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE BECAUSE THE PATIENT MIGHT SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT COMPANY, AND THEY WILL LOSE THE BENEFIT OF THE INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION. BUT IF A PATIENT NEEDS HIS FOOT AND HE STATED, THE REASONING GOES, INSURANCE COMPANIES PRETTY MUCH ARE STUCK WITH THAT ON THEIR WATCH. THAT IS UPSIDE DOWN AND BACKWARDS AND I'M GOING TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS TIME WE FOCUSED ON KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY, NOT JUST ON TREATING THEM WHEN THEY BECOME SICK. [APPLAUSE] NOW I KNOW THAT THESE PROPOSALS WILL NOT THEY'D MEET THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S WOMAN OF THE YEAR. WHAT I NOW THINK I HAVE BEEN IN THE RUNNING FOR THAT TITLE SINCE 1993. AT THE SAME TIME I TRULY BELIEVE THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHO WISH THERE COMPANIES DID NOT MAKE A PROFIT BY EXCLUDING A WOMAN WHO DISCOVERS SHE IS GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED TOWARD GETTING BREAST CANCER, OR BY BURDENING THE FAMILY WHOSE CHILD HAS AUTISM WITH UNMANAGEABLE PREMIUMS. THE IDEA IS NOT TO PUT THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT TO HELP BUT FIND A BETTER WAY TO MAKE A LIVING. UNDER MY PLAN, INSURANCE COMPANY EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE A WHOLE NEW SET OF INCENTIVES, THEY WILL WAKE UP EVERY DAY IN FOCUS ON MAKING PROFITS BY PROVIDING THE HIGHEST QUALITY CARE AT THE LOWEST COST AND IT THEY WILL NEVER AGAIN BE TORN BETWEEN TURNING A PROFIT AND IMPROVING THE HEALTHCARE OF INDIVIDUALS WHOM THEY INSURED OF COMMITTEES AND OUR COUNTRY. NOW HOW WILL IT PAY FOR THIS PLAN? FIRST LET ME TELL YOU HOW I WILL NOT PAY FOR THAT PLAN. I WILL NOT PAY FOR IT BY POURING MONEY INTO A BROKEN SYSTEM. I WANT TO PAY FOR IT BY RAISING TAXES ON MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH RISING COSTS AND STAGNANT WAGES. INSTEAD, I WILL PAY FOR PART OF IT BY IMPLEMENTING THE COST-SAVING MEASURES I OUTLINED IN MAY, AND I WILL PAY FOR SOME OF IT BY ROLLING BACK PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TAX BREAKS FOR THE HIGHEST INCOME AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] AND I WILL PAY FOR SOME OF IT BY LIMITING THE TAX BREAKS FOR PEOPLE MAKING OVER $250,000 A YEAR, THE SAME LEVEL THAT ORDINARY, MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS GET, RIGHT NOW THE HIGHEST INCOME AMERICANS HAVE SOME OF THE MOST GENEROUS HEALTH-CARE BENEFITS AND THE MOST GENEROUS TAX DEDUCTIONS TO GO WITH THEM. WELL-OFF AMERICANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEDUCT THE COST OF THE SAME QUALITY HEALTH PLAN THAT MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES CAN DEDUCT. IF THEY WANT TO RECEIVE EXTRA BENEFITS BEYOND WHAT MOST MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES GET, THEY SHOULD PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES, NOT HAVE TAXPAYERS FOOT THE BILL FOR THEM. [APPLAUSE] ANNOUNCING MY PLAN TODAY IS JUST ONE STEP IN A LARGER PROCESS. AND THE COMING MONTHS, I WILL CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND ASK FOR THEIR IDEAS, AND THEIR REACTIONS. BECAUSE TO TRULY REFORM HEALTHCARE IN AMERICA, WE NEED MORE THAN A PLAN, WE NEED A MOVEMENT. A MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE DETERMINED TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM, WHO WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE SUCCEED. LEEZA SCOTT OF GREENVILLE IOWA, WHOM I MET BACK IN MAY, IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. SIX YEARS AGO HER DAUGHTER JANELLE BEGAN HAVING CHEST PAINS AND BLACKOUT. SHE WAS SICK FOR ALMOST A YEAR. JANELLE REQUESTED A CHEST X-RAY, BUSHEE NEVER RECEIVED IT. BECAUSE WHILE SHE WAS WORKING TWO JOBS, SHE DID NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT OUT OF HER OWN POCKET. ONE WEEK AFTER BEING DENIED THE CHEST X-RAY AT THE AGE OF 18, JANELLE DIED. HER DEATH CERTIFICATE LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS THE KNOWN. BECAUSE JANELLE WAS NEVER ABLE TO AFFORD A PROPER DIAGNOSIS. A DIAGNOSIS THAT WOULD CARE MIGHT SAVE HER LIFE. IT IS TOO LATE TO HELP HER DAUGHTER, BUT LISA SCOTT HAS NOT STOPPED SPEAKING OUT AND CALLING ON US TO COME TOGETHER AND FIX OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. SHE IS DETERMINED TO HELP OTHER FAMILIES TO SPARE THEM THE LOSS AND PAIN THAT HER FAMILY FELT. NOW THAT IS WHO WE ARE AT OUR BEST REGO WE ARE A NATION WHERE PEOPLE HELP THOSE THEY HAVE NEVER EVEN MET. RARE WE DO UNDERSTAND WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. THAT WHEN A CHILD IS SICK AND CAN'T SEE A DOCTOR, THE FAMILY LOSES EVERYTHING BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD AN ACCIDENT. WHEN A MOTHER OR FATHER LIES AWAKE NIGHTS WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN POSSIBLY CARE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE. THAT DIMINISHES ALL OF US. NOW AFTER 1994, WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME IF I WAS GOING TO GIVE UP ON HEALTH-CARE REFORM, I ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME ANSWER. WHY WOULD I GIVE UP ON AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? THERE ARE -- FOR SOME MANY YEARS I'VE LISTENED TO THEIR STORIES. I CARRY THESE STORIES WITH ME EVERY DAY AND PERHAPS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE I KNOW JUST HOW HARD THIS FIGHT WILL BE. BUT THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE I AM READY WITH YOU TO HELP WRITE A NEW STORY, A STORY OF HOW WE FINALLY PUT ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES, FACING UP TO ONE OF OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. THE STORY OF HOW PEOPLE OF GOOD FAITH AND GOODWILL CAME TOGETHER AND WORKED OUT A SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY CARED TOO MUCH ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS TO LET THIS CRISIS CONTINUE. THE STORY OF HOW EVERYONE SIT RESPONSIBILITY. WE ALL DID OUR PART AND WE BECAME A HEALTHIER, STRONGER, MORE PROSPEROUS NATION BECAUSE OF IT. WE OWE THAT TO THE ROSE FAMILY, THE WHEEL THAT TO THE MEMORY OF JANELLE AND HER FAMILY. WE'LL THAT TO EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA. TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I HOPE ALL OF YOU WILL JOIN ME. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?201472-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"THIS IS THE SCENE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE A BARN PARTY RALLY IS COMING UP. NEW YORK SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO BE SPEAKING WITH VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS AND A FEW MOMENTS. AGAIN, THE SENATOR IS RUNNING A BIT LATE. SHE WAS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE 10 OR 15 MINUTES AGO AND WE HEARD THAT ARE RUNNING A BIT LATE. SEVERAL STOPS FOR THE SENATOR TODAY. WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE CO- CHAIRMAN OF THE CANTERBURY TOWN DEMOCRATS. HE HAS THE INTRODUCTION HONORS TODAY AT THIS EVENT. OUR LIVE COVERAGE, WHEN IT GETS UNDER WAY, HERE ON C-SPAN. A STORY IN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS TODAY REGARDING SENATOR CLINTON -- THE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO TAKE HER NAME OFF OF THE MICHIGAN PRIMARY BALLOT AND SACRIFICE OUR CHANCES AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AS THE ONLY TOP TIER DEMOCRAT REMAINING ON THE MICHIGAN VALID, SHE IS ALL BUT GUARANTEED TO WIN THE STATE'S PRIMARY. MICHIGAN IS TENTATIVELY SLATED TO SEND DELEGATES TO THE 2008 SPELLING -- CONVENTION, DELEGATES HAVE BEEN TRENDY TAKEN AWAY IF THE STATE HOLDS A PRIMARY ON JANUARY 15. SENATOR CLINTON SAID TODAY DURING AN INTERVIEW ON THE PENSION -- NEW HAMPSHIRE PUBLIC RADIO PROGRAM THAT IT WILL NOT COUNT FOR ANYTHING, BUT I PERSONALLY DID NOT WANT TO SET UP A SITUATION WHERE THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE CAMPAIGNING BETWEEN NOW AND WHENEVER AND AFTER THE NOMINATION WE HAD TO GO REPAIR THE DAMAGE TO BE READY TO WIN MICHIGAN IN 2008. THAT IS THE QUOTE FROM A CALL-IN PROGRAM ON PUBLIC RADIO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE STORY CONTINUES THAT SPEAKING IN THE FIRST PRIMARY STATE, HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE UNDERSTANDS CONCERNS THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS HER REFUSAL -- SEVERAL OTHER CANDIDATE TOOK THEIR NAMES OFF THE PRIMARY BALLOT IN MICHIGAN AND THEIR HOPE FOR NOMINATING CLOUT ALL FOR -- ALL BUT EVAPORATED. THAT IS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. THIS IS THE SCENE IN CADBURY, THE HAMPSHIRE, SENATOR KELLY -- SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE FOR A BARN PARTY IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS AND OUR LIVE COVERAGE WILL PICK UP AT THAT POINT. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] >> GOOD AFTERNOON. AND THE CO-CHAIR OF THE CANTERBURY DEMOCRATS AND I JUST WANT TO QUICKLY ACKNOWLEDGE MY CO-CHAIR. [APPLAUSE] I AM HERE TODAY IN MY ROLE AS A PROUD SUPPORTER OF DEBRIS CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] -- HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT. THERE IS NO ONE MORE QUALIFIED TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY HEALTH CARE AND RETIREMENT SECURITY. I HAD KNOWN SENATOR CLINTON FOR ALMOST 15 YEARS, SINCE MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH-CARE TASK FORCE. I WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM AND HER ENERGY, PASSION, AND COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL OUR CITIZENS. THIS PAST AUGUST, I UNEXPECTEDLY HAD TO UNDERGO MAJOR SURGERY. I WAS FORTUNATE. I HAVE A GREAT EMPLOYER, AND EXCELLENT BENEFITS. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF I HAD NOT HAD THIS COVERAGE. I CANNOT IMAGINE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM SURGERY WHILE WORRYING ABOUT MEDICAL BILLS. CLEARLY, NO ONE SHOULD BE PUT IN THIS SITUATION. SENATOR CLINTON HAS PROMISED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF OUR HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE HER KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE MAKE HER THE CANDIDATE BEST SUITED TO DELIVER ON THIS PLEDGE AND BRING ABOUT THE CHANGES WE NEED. PLEASE JOIN ME NOW IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS GREAT. SO BEAUTIFUL. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD BE HAVING A BARN DANCE. NOT A POLITICAL EVENT. I WANT TO THANK STEVE AND HIS WIFE FOR THEIR KIND SUPPORT, THEIR FRIENDSHIP, I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK STEVE FOR TRYING TO HELP US DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS WE FACED IN HEALTH CARE BEFORE AND I WILL CALL ON HIM TO HELP AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. I WANT TO THINK IS CO-CHAIR, THANK YOU FOR BEING THE ENGINE BEHIND DEMOCRATS HERE AND I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK HARRY AND LINDA WHO ON THIS BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHMENT FOR WELCOMING US HERE. [APPLAUSE] EACH OF THEIR MOTHERS ARE HERE. A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE -- THEIR NEIGHBORS, THEIR FRIENDS, BY THANK YOU ALL. I WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE SUNNIER, BUT THE SPIRIT IS SO WARM. I HAVE A SPECIAL SPOT IN MY HEART FOR APPLE ORCHARDS AND APPLE FARMERS. WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM IN NEW YORK AS YOU KNOW, AND I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THEM OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. IT IS SUCH A TREMENDOUS LABOR OF LOVE HAVING THESE ORCHARDS. WHAT YOU PRODUCE FROM THEM IS VERY SPECIAL AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO KEEP OUR ORCHARDS AND KEEP OUR BEAUTIFUL, ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE AND OUR FAMILY FARMS BECAUSE THAT IS THE REAL BACKBONE OF RURAL AREAS LIKE THIS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NEW YORK OR ANYWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY. I'M JUST AMAZED AT THIS WONDERFUL TURNOUT AND I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW THINGS AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISSUES ON YOUR MINDS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK KATHY AND OTHERS WHO CAME AND PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER. I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING SO HARD. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER IN OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE SEEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON EVIDENCE AND IS WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND COMMON GROUND WHERE EVER WE CAN. WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DENIED OR DISMISSED OVER THE LAST SIX AND HALF YEARS. NOW, WE HAVE TO START ACTING LIKE AMERICANS AGAIN. WE HAVE TO START ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND WORKING TOGETHER. I WANT TO SET BIG GOALS FOR AMERICA AND I HAVE FOUR BIG GOALS. I WANT TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD. THAT STARTS WITH, BUT DOES NOT END WITH, BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ. WE HAVE TO DO THAT, BUT WE HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT. THE MIDDLE-CLASS IS THE ENGINE OF ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE LOTS OF ANXIETIES AND INSECURITIES THAT PEOPLE FEEL ARE KEEPING THEM FROM MOVING AHEAD THE WAY PREVIOUS GENERATIONS HAVE. I WANT TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH DESPERATELY NEEDS IT AFTER THE BUSH-CHENEY AND ADMINISTRATION FINALLY SAYS GOODBYE. AND I WANT TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN. WHAT I MEAN BY ALL OF THOSE IS VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS THAT I HAVE BEEN LAYING OUT IN THE CAMPAIGN. WHEN IT COMES TO RESTORING AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO EXTRICATE US FROM IRAQ. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DO IT, IT IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO DO IT, BUT HE HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE DOES NOT INTEND TO DO IT. I'VE SAID THAT IF THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT END THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE, WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, I WILL. AND I WILL BEGIN AS SOON AS I TAKE OFFICE, WORKING WITH MY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, MY SECURITY ADVISERS, TO BEGIN A CAREFUL, RESPONSIBLE WITHDRAWAL AS QUICKLY AS WE REASONABLY CAN DO IT. THE AMERICAN MILITARY HAS DONE EVERYTHING WE ASKED THEM TO DO. OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM -- THEY ARE ASKED TO GET RID OF SADDAM HUSSEIN AND THEY DID. THEY WERE ASKED TO GIVE THE IRAQIS FREE AND FAIR ELECTION THAN THEY DID THAT. THEY'RE ASKED TO GIVE THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THE SPACE AND TIME TO MAKE THE DECISIONS POLITICALLY THAT ONLY THE IRAQIS CAN MAKE FOR THEMSELVES. SO, WE ARE NOW REFEREEING THEIR CIVIL WAR BECAUSE THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT -- THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE ITS PART IN THE BUSH'S PENETRATION HAS NOT DONE ITS PART. I DO NOT WANT OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN REFEREEING THEIR CIVIL WAR ANY LONGER. THEY NEED TO COME HOME. THEY HAVE EARNED OUR GRATITUDE AND THANKS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THEY DO COME HOME WE TAKE CARE OF THEM. WE SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO FUNDING THE VETERANS' MINISTRATION, TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED, TO TAKE CARE OF IS NOT JUST HAVE PHYSICAL AILMENTS, BUT THE RESULTS OF STRESSFUL CONDITIONS THEY FOUND IN THIS BATTLEFIELD THAT HAD NO BOUNDARIES AND WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT IS THE NEW SIGNATURE WOUND OF THIS WAR -- SOMETHING CALLED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, WHICH HAS AFFECTED THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS, MARINES AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THESE IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THAT BLOWUP EVERYWHERE THEY TURN. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR VETERANS. THAT MEANS ALL OF OUR VETERANS, BUT WE HAVE TO BE ESPECIALLY FOCUSED ON THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE COMING HOME. WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO WORKING WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT IS NOT JUST IRAQ, IT IS NOT JUST THE GULF REGION, IT IS NOT JUST THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE CHALLENGES AND THREATS EVERYWHERE. PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICIES HAVE ALIENATED OUR FRIENDS AND EMBOLDENED OUR ENEMIES. WHAT I HAVE SAID IS I WILL NOT EVEN WAIT UNTIL I AM ELECTED TO START TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO BECAUSE AS SOON AS I AM ELECTED, I WANT TO ASK DISTINGUISH AMERICANS OF BOTH PARTIES TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD ON MY BEHALF WITH A SIMPLE MESSAGE TO GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ALIKE -- THE ERA OF COWBOY DIPLOMACY IS OVER. WE'RE GOING TO START WORKING WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE FOR ME IS KIND OF SIMPLE. YOU CANNOT BE A LEADER IF NO ONE IS FALLING. RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] -- IF NO ONE IS FALLING. WHENEVER A PROBLEM WE FACE AROUND THE WORLD, WHETHER ITS GLOBAL TERRORISM, GLOBAL WARMING, OR GLOBAL COMPETITION, WE CANNOT HANDLE THEM ALL BY OURSELVES. WE NEED FRIENDS AND ALLIES WHO WILL FOLLOW AMERICA'S LEAD AND WE WILL DO THAT AGAIN WHEN I'M PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] HERE AT HOME, WE HAVE A BIG AGENDA TO ADDRESS. I REALLY START WITH WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM AMONG AMERICANS THAT IF THEY WORK HARD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, THEIR LIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES WILL GET BETTER. THAT IS THE WAY I WAS RAISED. I WAS LUCKY -- I HAD A FATHER WHO WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN WHO STARTED HIS BUSINESS AFTER HE GOT OUT OF THE NAVY IN WORLD WAR TWO AND HE TAUGHT ME INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SELF-RELIANCE AND HARD WORK. I HAD A MOTHER NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT SHE WANTED EDUCATION FOR HER CHILDREN SO SHE EMPHASIZED THAT AND WORK WITH US. I HAD A REALLY GOOD START. IT WAS NOT JUST MY PARENTS WHO GAVE ME THAT, IT WAS MY COUNTRY THAT GAVE ME THAT. I BELIEVE THAT IF I DID MY PART, EVEN AS A LITTLE GIRL, LAST WEEK AND GAVE A SPEECH ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LAUNCH OF SPUTNIK. I TOLD A STORY ABOUT HOW WELL I REMEMBER MY FIFTH GRADE TEACHER COMING IN AFTER SPUTNIK WENT UP AND SAID CHILDREN, THE PRESIDENT WANTS YOU TO LEARN MATH AND SCIENCE. I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD CALLED HER PERSONALLY AND TOLD HER TO TELL THE KIDS THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR PART FOR THE COUNTRY. WE WERE ALL IN IT TOGETHER AND WE SAW PROGRESS. GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. I DO NOT WANT TO BE PART OF THE FIRST GENERATION OF AMERICANS THAT WE USE OUR COUNTRY WORSE OFF THAN WHEN WE FOUND IT. BUT LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY -- THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAS LOST A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INCOME IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IS UP, THE COST OF ENERGY IS UP, AND BOY, THE COST OF EDUCATION IS UP. MANY FAMILIES FEEL LIKE THEY ARE STANDING ON A TRAP DOOR THAT COULD DROP OUT FROM UNDER THEM IF THEY GET LAID OFF OR GET FIRED OR LOSE THEIR JOB OR THEIR COMPANY MOVES TO ANOTHER COUNTRY OR THEY HAVE A BAD MEDICAL DIAGNOSES OR THEY MISS THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT. WE HAVE GOT TO REBUILD THE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE PART OF. HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO -- I WANT TO GET BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. SIX AND HALF YEARS AGO, WE HAD A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS WHEN GEORGE BUSH TOOK OFFICE AND THAT IS ALL GONE NOW. I THINK THAT HAS PUT US IN A WEAKER POSITION. PRESIDENT BUSH HAS HAD TWO PRINCIPAL PRIORITIES -- TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS AND THE IRAQ WAR. BUT HE HAS NOT WON -- HE HAS NOT BEEN WILLING TO PAY FOR EITHER ONE OF THEM. WHAT HE HAS DONE IS ONLY PASSED THE BURDEN ONTO OUR CHILDREN. BUT HE HAS DONE SOMETHING ELSE -- I BELIEVE HE HAS UNDERMINED OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE BORROW MONEY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE OWE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN AND SAUDI ARABIA. WE EVEN ZERO MONEY TO MEXICO. -- WE EVEN OWE MONEY TO MEXICO. WE'RE NOT IN CONTROL OF OUR FISCAL PASSED ME THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. I ALSO WANT TO START CREATING NEW JOBS IN AMERICA. WE NEED A NEW JOB CREATOR AND I THINK IF WE ARE SMART ABOUT IT, IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT ENERGY POLICY AND THE RIGHT POLICY TO DEAL WITH GLOBAL WARMING WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW, GOOD JOBS. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE AHEAD OF US IN DOING THIS. GERMANY HAS CREATED 285,000 JOBS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ON A MUCH SMALLER ECONOMY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING A COMMITTED TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. THESE ARE JOBS THAT ARE NOT EASILY OUTSOURCED. IF WE MOVE TOWARD MORE SOLAR POWER, SOMEBODY HAS TO CLIMB UP AND PUT THE SOLAR PANELS ON YOUR ROOF. WE COULD DO SO MUCH IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND BE MORE ATTUNED TO WHETHER. IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING POLICIES, WE WILL ENHANCE OUR SECURITY, WE WILL FINALLY TAKE SERIOUSLY THE WARMING OF THE CLIMATE AND WHAT ALL THAT MEANS, AND WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS. I WANT TO HAVE A STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING NEEDED TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO SOLAR, WIND, AND BIOMASS AND GEOTHERMAL AND ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE. HERE IS HOW I WOULD FIND IT -- TAKE AWAY THIS THAT -- THE TAX SUBSIDIES FROM WILL COMPANIES. THEY DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY TO MAKE THE LARGEST PROFITS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT EDUCATION, STARTING WITH PREKINDERGARTEN WHICH I THINK IS A WAY TO GET PEOPLE PREPARED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL, OTHERWISE AN AMERICAN YOUNGSTER DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL EVERY 29 SECONDS. THAT IS A LOSS FOR THEM AND IT'S A LOSS FOR THE REST OF US. WE ALSO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT, WHICH IS AN UNFUNDED MANDATE ON OUR SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS AND WE HAVE TO GET THAT BURDEN OFF OF OUR SCHOOLS WITHOUT LOSING ACCOUNTABILITY, WE CAN DO IT IN A BETTER, MORE EFFECTIVE WAY. WE HAVE TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. I JUST CAME FROM PLYMOUTH STATE WHERE I OUTLINED MY STRATEGY FOR MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WE ARE SEEING AN EROSION IN THE ABILITY OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. I HAD A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER APPEAR WITH ME AT PLYMOUTH STATE. THE DAUGHTER IS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, PRESIDENT OF THE JUNIOR CLASS, DOING WELL, SHE'S THE FOURTH OF FOUR CHILDREN AND HER FAMILY. HER PARENTS ARE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, HER MOTHER IS NOT DISABLED, HER FATHER WORKS FULL TIME. HER THREE OLDER BROTHERS, ONE WENT INTO THE MILITARY, ONE WENT TO TECHNICAL SCHOOL, AND THE OTHER IS ABOUT A GOOD TECHNICAL SCHOOL. IT WAS HARD FOR THE FAMILY TO AFFORD THAT FOR THE THREE OF THEM AND NOW THE DAUGHTER WANTS TO THE COLLEGE AND HER MOTHER SAID IF WE HAVE TO SELL THE HOUSE, WE'RE GOING TO SELL THE HOUSE BECAUSE SHE HAS EARNED IT. I GOT TEARS IN MY EYES. THINK ABOUT THAT -- THIS YOUNG WOMAN IS DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT, A GOOD STUDENT, A LEADER, AND HERE SHE IS IN AMERICA AND HER FAMILY HAS TO CONSIDER SELLING THE HOUSE? WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT AND I HAVE OUTLINED PLAN AS TO HOW WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO THE KIND OF HELP I GOT. WHEN I WENT COLLEGE, MY FATHER SAVED ENOUGH MONEY FOR ROOM, BOARD, AND TUITION, BUT HE SAYS IF YOU WANT TO BUY A BOOK YOU HAVE TO EARN THE MONEY. HE SAID THIS IS ALL I CAN AFFORD. SO I DID, I WORKED ALL THROUGH SCHOOL AND A COUPLE OF TIMES I GOT INTO A TIGHT SPOT AND WE HAD A WONDERFUL PLAN WHERE I COULD BORROW MONEY TO MEET SOME EXPENSES AND THEN PAY IT BACK. IT WAS A REVOLVING LOAN FUND. I DECIDED I WANT TO GO THE LAW SCHOOL AND I TELL MY DAD AND HE SAID THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE DEAL. IF YOU WANT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL, YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN TRADE I KEPT WORKING, I GOT A SMALL SCHOLARSHIP, AND I COULD BORROW MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT 2% INTEREST. I DID NOT HAVE TO GO INTO THAT, MY FAMILY DID NOT HAVE TO SELL THE HOUSE, I COULD BORROW MONEY AND PAY IT BACK OVER TIME. LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE DONE -- WE HAVE TURNED OVER TO STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES AND THEY HAVE IN MY HUMBLE OPINION BEEN VERY BAD FOR MOST MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. IT HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD DEAL FOR AMERICA. WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO CHEAPER LOANS, MORE SCHOLARSHIPS, MORE GRANTS, MORE AID SO THAT WERE THE STUDENTS CAN GO TO COLLEGE. LET'S MAKE THAT A HIGH PRIORITY. [APPLAUSE] I ALSO DO NOT WANT TO FORGET THE MAJORITY OF THE AND PEOPLE WHO DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE. WE HAVE A LOT OF WONDERFUL, HARD-WORKING, PRODUCTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY DON'T GO TO COLLEGE. WHAT WE DO FOR THEM? WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND SKILL TRAINING PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF QUALIFIED MECHANICS, WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF A LOT OF SKILLED WORKERS. I HAD THE NEW YORK AUTO DEALERS COME TO SEE ME LAST YEAR AND THEY SAID SENATOR, WE HAVE 600 JOBS OPENING RIGHT NOW FOR AUTO MECHANICS ACROSS NEW YORK AND WE CAN FIND THEM BECAUSE NOBODY TRAINS THEM ANYMORE. IT'S MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE ALL OUR CARS HAVE COMPUTERS THAT TALK TO US NOW AND TELL US WHERE WE GO. CITY HAVE TO HAVE MORE TRAINING. SHORTLY AFTER THAT I HAD A VISIT FROM THE AIRLINE MECHANICS WHO TOLD ME THE SAME THING. I GET ON AIRPLANES AND I WANT A GOOD MECHANIC CHECKING OUT THE PLANE BEFORE I GET ON. I WANT TO DO MORE TO TAKE ON -- TO TAKE CARE OF JOB NEED TO DO NOT GOOD COLLEGE. LET'S DO MORE TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE JOB IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THEN, WE WILL HAVE TO FINALLY DEAL WITH HEALTH CARE. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO SPEND WAY MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD, TWO TRILLION DOLLARS, AND NOT COVER EVERYONE AND GIVE YOU THE BEST BELLYFUL WHAT YOU BUY. WE HAVE 47 MILLION UNINSURED, WE HAVE MILLIONS MORE WHO HAVE INSURANCE EXCEPT FOR WHEN THEY REALLY NEED IT. AS THE SENATOR FOR THE LAST NEARLY SEVEN YEARS, I DON'T HEAR FROM THE UNINSURED THAT OFTEN. THEY GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THEY OFTEN GO LATE, AFTER THEY HAVE GOTTEN A LOT SICKER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE IF THEY COULD HAVE AFFORDED TO GO SOMEWHERE EARLIER. I HEAR FROM PEOPLE WITH INSURANCE. I HEAR FROM THE FATHER FROM NUDE -- FROM NORTHERN NEW YORK WHO CALLS ME AND ASKS WHAT HE HAS DONE WRONG. I HAD THE SAME EMPLOYER, I'VE ALWAYS PAID MY PREMIUMS, A FAMILY HAS BEEN HEALTHY, AND IT DIDN'T COST ANYBODY MUCH MONEY TO ENSURE REST UNTIL NOW WHEN MY SON HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A VERY RARE DISEASE AND THE DOCTORS SAY THERE IS ONE PLACE HE SHOULD GO IN THE COUNTRY AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS NO. FOR THE MOTHER WHO CALLS ME AND SAYS HER DAUGHTER HAS LEUKEMIA AND SHE NEEDS A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT, BUT THE INSURANCE COMPANY WILL PAY FOR THE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT BUT NOT THE DONOR SEARCH. SHE SAYS SHE IS A FAMILY OF MODEST MEANS AND CANNOT AFFORD IT. I INTERVENE AND WE ARGUE WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEY SAY OKAY WE WILL LET THE BOY GOING GET AN OPERATION AND WE WILL PAY FOR THE BONE MARROW DONOR SEARCH, IT SHOULD NOT TAKE A UNITED STATES SENATOR TO GET A MOTHER OR FATHER AID TO -- THE HEALTH CARE THEY THOUGHT THEY PURCHASED WHEN THEY BROUGHT -- WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE INSURANCE POLICY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? [APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHAT I AM PROPOSING -- I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I HAVE WORKED ON OF A LONG TIME. I HAVE COME UP WITH WHAT I CALL THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PROGRAM AND HERE IS HOW IT WORKS -- IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE AND YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH IT, YOU KEEP IT. YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING, JUST KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE MILLIONS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR ONE OF THE MILLIONS MILLIONS MORE WHO HAVE INSURANCE EXCEPT THEY DON'T COVER OR ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR AND WILL PAY THE HOSPITAL AND YOU THINK YOU CAN GET A BETTER DEAL, WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP FOR ALL AMERICANS THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN THAT OFFERS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND OTHER FEDERAL EMPLOYEES THE GREATEST JOYS OF HEALTH-CARE OPTIONS YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE IN AMERICA -- OVER 250 PLANS. IT IS CHEAPER THAN EMPLOYERS CAN -- CAN AFFORD FOR YOU OR YOU COULD BUY FOR YOURSELF. I FIGURE, IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONGRESS, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA AND WE WILL MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU. [APPLAUSE] FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT STILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT, WE WILL PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS AND FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, IF THEY WANT TO HELP THEIR EMPLOYEES, THEY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED, BUT IF THEY WANT TO, THEY WILL GET HEALTH CARE TAX CREDIT. BETWEEN GETTING COSTS DOWN AND CHOICES INCREASED SAID THERE IS MORE COMPETITION BETWEEN INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU, I THINK WE WILL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE TO COVER EVERYONE AS LONG AS WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS TO CHANGE THE WAY IT DOES BUSINESS. THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO DENY PEOPLE HEALTH CARE AND NOT COVER YOU FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THEN FIGHT WITH YOUR DOCTOR AND FIGHT WITH YOU AND FIGHT WITH A HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY TO COVER WHAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD PURCHASED. I AM TELLING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A NEW BUSINESS PLAN BECAUSE THE WAY YOU ARE MAKING MONEY NOW IS NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA. IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN BUSINESS, E HAVE TO COMPETE ON COST AND QUALITY. COVER PREVENTION, WHICH DIDN'T LIKE TO DO NOW, MANAGE CHRONIC CONDITIONS WHICH THEY LIKE TO DO NOW, QUIT FIGHTING WITH DOCTORS, PAY DOCTORS WITH A SHEET PATE, A NURSE IS WITH ASIA BE PAID FOR, A PHARMACIST BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONE TAKEN CARE OF US, NOT THE INSURANCE COMPANY BUREAUCRATS. IT IS NOT GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE. I DID NOT CREATE A SINGLE BIG BUREAUCRACY, BUT I DO TELL THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND DRUG COMPANIES THAT THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS THE WAY THEY HAVE AND IF WE ALTOGETHER WE CAN ACTUALLY GET A HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT WOULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE, WITH HIGHER QUALITY, THAT WILL COVER EVERYONE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE AND THE INSURANCE AND DRUG COMPANIES AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK MOST AMERICANS HAVE FINALLY DECIDED WE HAVE GOT TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] IN ORDER TO DO ANY OF THIS, WE HAVE TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO GET RID OF ALL THE CRONYISM AND NO BID CONTRACTS. WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT, BUT I WAS HEARTSICK AND EMBARRASSED WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT FAILED TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA AND HURRICANE RITA. IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING THE TELEVISION SET, YOU COULD HAVE TURNED OFF THE VOLUME AND IT WOULD'VE BEEN HARD TO BELIEVE THE STORY WAS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. OUR FELLOW AMERICANS TRAPPED ON ROOFTOPS, BODIES FLOATING DOWN THE STREET AND AN AMERICAN CITY? THAT'S NOT MY COUNTRY. WE HAVE GOT TO GET BACK TO HAVING A GOVERNMENT THAT IS COMPETENT. SO I HAVE AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA -- HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE POSITIONS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGAIN? [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE GOT TO END PRESIDENT BUSH'S WAR ON SCIENCE. HE HAVE MUZZLED GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS, THEY HAVE SUPPRESSED INFORMATION, AND ON MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE I AM GOING TO ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYING IN A DEMOCRACY, WE BELIEVE IN OPEN INQUIRY, WE BELIEVE IN FACTS AND NOT IDEOLOGY. THOSE ARE OTHER SYSTEMS, NOT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WILL REVERSE THE PRESIDENT'S BAN ON ETHICAL STEM CELL RESEARCH AS SOON AS I AM ABLE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE FINALLY, FOR ME, THIS IS ABOUT MY FOURTH GOAL OF RETAIL -- RECLAIMING THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN -- MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WAS NOT TO THE WALL STREET OR SOME BIG CORPORATION, I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GIVE OUR CHILDREN THE BEST CHANCE THEY CAN BE GIVEN TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. I HAVE WORK ESPECIALLY HARD OVER MANY YEARS NOW ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WHO CANNOT HAVE HEALTH CARE, DID NOT HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION, THEY ARE ABUSED OR NEGLECTED, THEY ARE CAUGHT UP IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM, THEY DRAW THE SHORT STRAW IN LIFE. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN AFTER WE REACH A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT IN THE SENATE TO EXTEND HEALTH CARE TO CHILDREN, PRESIDENT BUSH VETOED IT. IT WAS BIPARTISAN, IT WAS PAID FOR. AND DO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE OF HELP? PEOPLE WHO ARE MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING PEOPLE. IF YOU ARE POOR, YOU ARE EDGE -- YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. BUT IF YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT TOO WELL-OFF FOR MEDICAID AND YOU DON'T HAVE AN EMPLOYER WHO HELPS YOU AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY IT FOR YOURSELF BECAUSE THE AVERAGE FAMILY POLICY IS NOW OVER $12,000 IN AMERICA, YOU ARE LEFT OUT. WHEN THE PRESIDENT VETOED IT, HE SAID MANY THINGS THAT WERE NOT TRUE ABOUT WHAT IT WAS THAT WEEK, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, ARE TRYING TO HELP FAMILIES. THE REPUBLICANS TOOK HIM ON AND I WAS PROUD TO SEE THAT. INDIAN FAMILY CAME FORWARD, A YOUNG BOY -- AND THEN A FAMILY CAN AFFORD, A YOUNG BOY WHO IS A SERIOUS AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT AND HIS FATHER WORKS, HIS MOTHER WORKS, BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE. THEY'RE PART OF THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES THAT DO NOT HAVE AND THE NEARLY 9 MILLION CHILDREN WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT HE WAS LUCKY BECAUSE WE HAD THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, SOMETHING I HOPE TO START IN 1997. SO HIS FAMILY COULD GET HELP TO HEAL HIM FROM THE SIRIUS INDUSTRIES T -- SERIOUS INJURIES HE FACED. THE FAMILY SAID WE ARE A HARD- WORKING FAMILY THAT HAS BENEFITED FROM THE PROGRAM. AND ALL THESE IDEOLOGUES STARTED ATTACKING HIM. THEY STARTED ATTACKING A 12- YEAR-OLD BOY AND HIS FAMILY. THE PICTURES OF HIM UP ON THESE WEBSITES, THEY MADE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS WRONG HIS FAMILY SOUGHT HELP TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR SON AFTER HE WAS INJURED. WE HAVE GOT TO GET BEYOND THAT KIND OF POLITICS. WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN AMERICA, AND I PERSONALLY, I HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF ATTACKS OVER 15 YEARS AND THAT'S FINE. I CAN PROTECT MYSELF, I CAN SURVIVE. IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE. BUT ATTACKING THE 12 YEAR-OLD BOY AND HIS FAMILY BECAUSE THEY STOOD UP FOR THE PRINCIPLE THAT CHILDREN IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SHOULD NOT BE DEPRIVED OF HEALTH CARE? WE CAN'T LET THAT GO ONE. WE HAVE TO SAY WAIT A MINUTE, WE CAN HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES, BUT LET'S STOP ALL THE DEMONIZING AND MEAN SPIRITEDNESS. LET'S GO BACK TO TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS TOGETHER. IF WE HAVE DIFFERENCES, BUT AIR THEM AND TRY TO SEE THE COMPROMISE AND LET'S MAKE PROGRESS AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT I WILL U.S. PRESIDENT AND I WILL DO IT PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF OUR CHILDREN AND FUTURE. IT IS NOT ONLY CHILDREN WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE I WORRY ABOUT, IT'S ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. IF WE SEND THEM OUT INTO MORE DANGEROUS WORLD, WE HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE HAVE. SO I INTEND TO THINK EVERY SINGLE DAY WHAT MY DOING THAT WILL MAKE THE FUTURE BETTER FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR COUNTRY AND CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD? I'M THRILLED AT THE PROSPECT OF BECOMING THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT. IT'S SUCH AN HONOR AND IT'S EXCITING AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S MORE THAN I EVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL GROWING UP. BUT I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF A WOMAN. I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I THINK OF THE BEST QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED PERSON TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING, TO DO THE JOB RUNNING -- TO DO THE JOB WE NEED TO DO IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] I WANT AND WITH THIS STORY THAT SORT OF SUMS UP FOR ME WHEN I HOPE TO DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT. IT WAS TOLD ME BY MY FRIEND AND OUR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT. AS SOMEBODY MAY HAVE KNOWN, SHE WAS BORN IN THE FORMER CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND HER FAMILY HAD TO DEAL IS NOT THESE AND COMMUNISTS AND MAKING HIS REFUGEES TO THE U.S. IN 1995, SHE WAS ASKED IF SHE WOULD GO BACK TO EUROPE TO REPRESENT US AT THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIONS OF THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO AND SHE SAID OF COURSE, BECAUSE IT WAS A PERSONAL HONOR FOR HER TO DO IT. SHE TRAVELED AROUND EUROPE, PARTICULARLY WHAT WE USED TO CALL THE IRON CURTAIN. EVERYWHERE SHE WENT, SHE SOUGHT AMERICAN FLAGS. WHEN SHE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY, SHE REALIZED A LOT OF THE FLAGS HAD ONLY 48 STARTS. SHE BEGAN TO ASK PEOPLE AND THAT THE FLAGS AND EVERYONE TOLD HER THE SAME THING -- THEY SAID WHEN THE AMERICAN GIS LIBERATED EUROPE, THEY PASSED OUT THESE FLAGS. BECAUSE REMEMBER BACK IN 1945, ALASKA AND HAWAII WERE NOT STATES. SOME MADELEINE ALBRIGHT ASK THEM WHEN SHE WORRIED, ESPECIALLY IF THEY LIVED IN SOVIET OCCUPIED EUROPE, THAT YOU COULD GET IN TROUBLE AND PEOPLE SAID WE SAW THESE AS FAMILY TREASURES. WE PASSED THE DOWN FROM GRANDPARENTS TO PARENT TO CHILD. WHEN SHE ASKED WHY, THEY SAID BECAUSE WE LOVE AMERICA. WE'LL OF AMERICA'S NELLIES AND WE ALWAYS HOPE SOMEDAY WE WOULD LIVE IN FREEDOM LIKE AMERICA. -- WE LOVE AMERICA THAT VALUES AND WE ALWAYS HOPE SOMEDAY WE WOULD LIVE IN FREEDOM LIKE AMERICA. I WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT ABOUT OURSELVES AGAIN. WE ARE A GOOD AND GREAT NATION AND WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE READY TO MOVE INTO THE FUTURE WITH CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM, TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, AND TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP, AND TO ONCE AGAIN LIVE BY THE VALUES THAT MADE AMERICA GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS AND I HAD TO SHOUT A LITTLE BIT, ESPECIALLY EVERYBODY WAY OUT THERE. YES. EITHER ONE OF THE PERIOD -- EITHER ONE OF YOU. >> WE ARE AT THE TAIL END OF A LONG FIGHT, WHAT KIND OF ENERGY POLICY [UNINTELLIGIBLE] ESPECIALLY COAL FILED -- COAL- FIRED ELECTRIC POWER. >> NEW YORK AND NEW HAMPSHIRE BOTH SHARE THE SAME PROBLEM. THE JONES SAID HE'S CONCERNED THAT AIR POLLUTION. LIVING HERE, YOU ARE IN THE LONG PIPE THAT COMES FROM THE MIDWEST AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OUT OF THESE COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT DUNCE ACID RAIN AND OTHER POLLUTION RIGHT ON TOP OF THE. IT'S THE SAME PROBLEM IN NEW YORK. WE HAVE HAD TO FIGHT POLLUTION FROM THE MIDWEST AND SOUTH FOR YEARS. WE HAVE LOST A LOT OF THE LIFE IN SOME OF OUR LAKES UP IN THE ADIRONDACKS. WE HAVE SEEN OTHER EFFECTS OF THIS POLLUTION BEING DEPOSITED THAT WE DID NOT CREATE. IT'S ONE THING IF IT'S YOUR POLLUTION, BUT IT'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NATIONAL PLAN TO DEAL WITH POLLUTION, WITH OZONE, WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE CANNOT DO IT STATE-BY-STATE OR REGION BY REGION. IN FACT, WE CANNOT DO IT COUNTRY BY COUNTRY. MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE SEEING THE RESULTS OF THE INCREASING EMISSIONS COMING FROM CHINA. WHEN THEY ARE ADDING ONE COAL- FIRED POWER PLANT A WEEK, THAT IS ALL GOING UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE WIND CURRENTS TAKE IT ACROSS THE OCEAN. OUT OF A LOT OF THESE COAL-FIRED PLANTS COME POLICE LIKE MERCURY. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE SO MUCH MERCURY IN THE FISH WE EAT AND WHY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT. THE CAT AND TRADE SYSTEM THAT I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO WOULD LOOK AT ALL THIS AND TRY TO IMPOSE MORE OF A COST ON THOSE WHO ARE THE PRIMARY POLLUTERS. BUT IT HAS TO BE AN ECONOMY-WIDE SYSTEM, IT HAS TO BE TOTALLY EMBRACED BY THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND IT REQUIRES PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP TO GET PAST. WE ALSO NEED TO RESTART SOME KIND OF GLOBAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO GET CHINA AND INDIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WERE NOT IN KYOTO INTO A NEW INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT. OTHERWISE, WE WILL BE SUBJECTED TO POLLUTION FROM CHINA, INDIA, AND WE HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY RECOGNIZES THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO GROW, BUT THEY SHOULD MAYBE THINKING ABOUT GROWING WITHOUT POLLUTING THEIR OWN WATER, THEIR OWN AIR, THEIR OWN PEOPLE'S HEALTH. I AM GOING TO BE TALKING IN GREATER DETAIL NOT SPECIFICALLY WHY WOULD DO THIS -- I HAVE GIVEN TWO MAJOR SPEECHES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE ON MY WEBSITE AND A FEW WEEKS AND WILL GIVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK ON EVERYTHING AND LIKE TO DO TO DEAL WITH THIS. WE CANNOT DO IT VOLUNTARILY. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. THAT CONTINUES TO BE PRESIDENT BUSH'S ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. LET'S ALL DO IT VOLUNTARILY. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. THE UTILITIES, SOME OF THEM ARE MAKING WHAT I SEE AS RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS, THEY ARE INVESTING IN EQUIPMENT TO CLEAN UP THEIR EMISSIONS, THEY ARE LOOKING AT NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THEY ARE CONSIDERING HOW TO SEQUESTER CARBON. BUT MANY OF THEM ARE NOT AND WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THOSE BEYOND OUR BORDERS. WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK TO LOOK AT HOW TO CONTROL ALL THE COMMISSIONS AND THE ONE THAT ONE OTHER THING TO WITH THE GENENTECH BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT AIR POLLUTION, IT'S ABOUT THE IMPACT ON OUR HEALTH. THE EVIDENCE IS CONCLUSIVE -- THE MORE YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THIS KIND OF POLLUTANT FROM POWER PLANTS, FROM EMISSIONS, GAS AND DIESEL, THE MORE YOU BELIEVE THAT IN, IT AFFECTS YOUR HEALTH. IT IS PARTICULARLY BAD FOR CHILDREN, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, AND ALSO AFFECTS ADULTS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD DO IT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD DO IT FOR THE ECONOMY BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN CREATE JOBS BY DOING THIS. CERTAINLY MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR OUR HEALTH. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS, I'M STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF A NATIONAL APPROACH TO THIS AND THEN GET INTO A PROCESS THAT CAN LEAD TO AN INTERNATIONAL APPROACH AS WELL. WE DID TRY TO GET THIS UNDER CONTROL. GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH, IT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY, AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT. [APPLAUSE] >> D. YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR NATIONAL SERVICE? >> YES I DO. I'M A HUGE SUPPORTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE. I SPOKE ABOUT IT EARLIER TODAY AT PLYMOUTH STATE. ONE OF THE WAYS I WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE IS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO AMERICORPS AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- THE NET AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL GRANT THEY GET FOR GOING. I HAVE PROPOSED ALONG WITH SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER, A REPUBLICAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA, TO START A UNITED STATES PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMY MODELED ON MILITARY ACADEMIES. I THINK WE NEED A FEDERALLY FUNDED INSTITUTION THAT PROVIDES A TUITION-FREE EDUCATION ON THE CIVILIAN SIDE, JUST LIKE WE HAVE AND THE MILITARY SIDE. OUR MILITARY ACADEMIES TO A WONDERFUL JOB IN PROVIDING A FIRST-RATE EDUCATION FOR FREE AND PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATION OF MILITARY LEADERS. WE NEED MORE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE SEEN DRAMATICALLY THAT WE DO NOT HAVE PEOPLE STEPPING UP TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IN ALL SORTS OF AREAS. I WILL GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES. I HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSELY THE NUCLEAR REGOLITH NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION BECAUSE WE HAVE SEVERAL NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN NEW YORK, ONE IN THE TICKET OR CAUSES A LOT OF CONCERN TO US. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE PEOPLE WORKING AT THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION IS GETTING HIGHER. THEY'RE NOT RECRUITING IN THE PIPELINE. THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT, YOU SEE THIS AND I'M TALKING ABOUT SPECIALIZED WORK AS WELL AS MORE GENERAL WORK. WHERE WILL THE NEXT GENERATION OF CIVIL SERVANTS, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS, THOSE WHO DO THE WORK THAT SHOULD BE THE BEST WE CAN EXPECT IN OUR COUNTRY? I THINK A PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMY IS AN IDEA. FINALLY, WE JUST PASSED IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS A NEW SET OF INCENTIVES FOR COLLEGE WHICH I WORKED ON AND ONE OF WHICH WAS TO FORGIVE THE LOANS THAT PEOPLE GET FOR GOING TO COLLEGE IN RETURN FOR PERFORMING CERTAIN PUBLIC-SERVICE LIKE, WE HAVE A NURSING SHORTAGE, WE HAVE A TEACHING STORAGE. WEEK TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO INTO THIS BUT THEY OFTEN GO INTO SUCH THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT. YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED, BECAUSE I WAS SURPRISED TO READ THIS, NEW HAMPSHIRE IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATE IN THE COUNTRY FOR COLLEGE. PEOPLE GRADUATING FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE COLLEGES, WITH A HIGHER DEBT LOAD THAN PEOPLE ON AVERAGE, OUT OF IN OTHER STATES GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE. I FIGURE WOULD BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE TO GET THIS KIND OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED AND I WILL EMPHASIZE NATIONAL SERVICE. [APPLAUSE] . ALSO MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE, BUT NOT AS MANY AS HERE. DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF THESE POOR PEOPLE? >> WELL, WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY IS A UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED PHENOMENON SO I AM SO HAPPY YOU HAVE COME TO OBVIOUS FIRSTHAND BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT PART OF OUR POLITICAL PROCESS AND DEMOCRACY. THE QUESTION OF HOMELESSNESS IS SUCH A DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE THERE ARE VARIOUS REASONS WHY PEOPLE END UP BEING HOMELESS. SOME OF YOU, I'M SURE, HAVE WORKED IN THIS AREA OR STUDIED IT. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC REASONS, THEY LOSE A JOB, GET EVICTED, HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. A LOT OF THEM END UP IN HOMELESS SHELTERS, BUT THAT IS USUALLY TEMPORARY. THERE IS ANOTHER GROUP OF HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE OF ALL KINDS. THEY NEVER GET THE TREATMENT. THEY NEVER GET THE PROPER SUPERVISION, AND THEY OFTEN STAY HOMELESS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL. THEY NEVER GET THE TREATMENT. THEY GO FROM PLACE TO PLACE. THEN, THERE ARE SOME WHO -- VARIOUS FEW -- WHO ARE HOMELESS, PERSIST IN BEING HOMELESS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. BUT THOSE ARE A SMALL NUMBER. WE HAVE TO HAVE A POLICY THAT ADDRESSES THE DIFFERENT REASONS. IN THOSE CATEGORIES, WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF VETERANS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO COME BACK FROM THE HORRORS OF WAR, AND THEY HAVE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T GET PROPERLY HANDLED, AND THEY BECOME PART OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE YET FIGURED OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS. IN OUR COUNTRY, WE DON'T ROUND PEOPLE UP, THROW THEM INTO PROTECTIVE CONFINEMENT. WE TRY TO ENTICE THEM TO GET OFF THE STREETS, BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IF WE DON'T HAVE MORE SUBSTANCE TREATMENT PROGRAMS, AND MORE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS, IT'S HARD TO GET THESE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF DOING THIS. THERE IS EXPERIMENTATION GOING, AND I GIVE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION CREDIT FOR THIS, BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING EXPERIMENTATION, TAKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOWHERE TO GO, NO FAMILY, NOTHING. AND THEY ARE PUTTING THEM INTO APARTMENTS WITH SUPERVISION IN THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS BECAUSE WHAT THEY FIND IS IT'S CHEAPER TO KEEP THEM IN SOME KIND OF FACILITY THAN TO LET THEM WANDER AROUND, GET INTO TROUBLE, CAUSE TROUBLE, GO IN AND OUT OF JAIL. I AM VERY COMMITTED TO DOING WHAT I CAN ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. OH, MY GOODNESS. I WAS TOLD I ONLY HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE, BUT I'LL TRY TO HURRY. >> IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR IRAN TO GET THE BOMB? >> I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS, THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN. YOU KNOW, IRAN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SPONSORING TERRORISM. THEY SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH, WE KNOW. THEY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR BOMBINGS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING KILLING AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ELSEWHERE. THEY ARE NOW DEEPLY INVOLVED IN KILLING AMERICANS BY PROVIDING WEAPONS AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SO THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE GOT A DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN. BUT HERE IS WHAT I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. I WOULD ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN, WITH NO CONDITIONS. BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IRAN WORKS. WE THINK WE DO, FROM THE OUTSIDE, BUT I THINK IT IS MISLEADING. WE SPENT A COUPLE OF WEEKS PAYING ALL THIS ATTENTION TO AHMADINEJAD. HE IS A FIGURE HEAD. HE DOES NOT HAVE THE REAL POWER. THE REAL POWER IS HELD IN THE SUPREME LEADERSHIP AND THE CLERICAL LEADERSHIP. THEY ACTUALLY CONTROL THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS. I WANT TO HAVE SOME LEVERAGE WHEN WE GO INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION OUTSOURCED NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN TO THE BRITISH, FRENCH, GERMANS, AND NOTHING HAPPENED BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNEW THE UNITED STATES WAS ON THE SIDELINES. I THINK WE CAN GATHER INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL. THAT'S WHAT WE DID DURING THE COLD WAR. WE NEVER STOPPED TALKING THEN. THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY WOULD BURY US, BUT WE KEPT TALKING TO THEM AND GRADUALLY WE ACQUIRED GRADUALLY, INFORMATION THAT ASSISTED ABOUT BRINGING ABOUT THE END OF THE SOVIET UNION. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE WORLD TO SEE WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE BECAUSE WE NEED THE WORLD TO STAND WITH US WHEN IT COMES TO SANCTIONS AND OTHER PRESSURES ON IRAN, TO AVOID THEIR BECOMING A NUCLEAR POWER. THERE HAS BEEN BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO VIS-A-VIS IRAN, AND I WENT TO THE SENATE FLOOR LAST FEBRUARY AND SAID, PRESIDENT BUSH HAS NO AUTHORITY WHATSOEVER TO ATTACK IRAN. THE CONGRESS HAS GIVEN HIM NO AUTHORITY. AND I HAVE JOINED WITH MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR WEB IN PUTTING THAT SENTIMENT THAT I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT, INTO LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET PASSED IN THE CONGRESS. NOW, THE OTHER DAY, AND -- I AND 75 OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SENATE VOTED TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT AUTHORITY IN A NONBINDING RESOLUTION TO LABEL THE IRANIAN GUARD AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I DID THAT BECAUSE I THINK SANCTIONS AND PRESSURE APPLY TO IRAN IS BETTER THAN GOING TO WAR WITH IRAN. THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT RESOLUTION THAT GAVE PRESIDENT BUSH OR ANYONE ANY AUTHORITY TO GO TO WAR. PEOPLE WHO DID NOT VOTE FOR THE AUTHORITY IN 2002, LIKE DICK DURBIN, JACK ELEVEN, VOTED WITH ME. BECAUSE WE WANT LEVERAGE SO WE CAN GET THE BUSH NEGOTIATION TO THEY HAVE STICKS AT THE TABLE. THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD IS KNEE-DEEP IN TRANSACTIONS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. WE NEED TOOLS TO GET AT THAT AND TO USE THAT IF WE EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS ANY WAY THAT WE CAN CONVINCE, PERSUADE, THREATEN THE IRANIANS NOT TO PURSUE NUCLEAR POWER. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. NO CONDITIONS, WITH STICKS WE COULD USE TO GET LEVERAGE TO MOVE THEM IN THE DIRECTION WE WANT. I GUESS I KNOW WE HAVE TO GO, NICK, BUT THIS IS SO MUCH FUN. WELL, ALL RIGHT. LAST QUESTION. I SAW YOUR HAND GO UP. >> IF YOU COULD ANSWER THIS, A FEW WORDS, IF WE CAN BOTTOM LINE IT, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE CHANGES TO BE WITH THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHEN THE PERSON AT THE HELM HAS A LOT LESS TESTOSTERONE? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN ASKED A LOT OF THINGS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED THAT BEFORE. LOOK, I THINK IT MATTERS WHO THE PERSON IS, BUT I DO THINK BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TO MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES, BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DECISION MAKING ROLES AROUND THE WORLD, AND BECAUSE THE WORLD IS DESPERATELY HOPING TO SEE A CHANGE FROM THE BUSH-CHENEY ADMINISTRATION, I THINK THAT IN AND OF ITSELF WILL BE A REALLY POSITIVE OPENING. NOW, IT DOESN'T MANE PEOPLE WILL START AGREEING WITH US, BUT AT LEAST IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REBUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. I THINK THE FACT I AM A WOMAN AND BECAUSE A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HAD WOMEN LEADERS. RIGHT NOW, THE FIRST GERMAN CHANCELLOR IS A WOMAN. YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA, MAGGIE THAT MUCHER,. WE ARE BEHIND HERE, I WOULD SAY. [APPLAUSE] I THINK IT WILL BE VIEWED POSITIVELY, BUT I ALSO THINK IT WILL SERVE AS A SYMBOL OF THE WAY THE UNITED STATES HAS WORKED ACROSS OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY WHERE WE ARE ALWAYS KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS. WE ARE THE COUNTRY THAT IS CONSTANTLY INVENTING THE FUTURE. FOR MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, THAT WILL BE SEEN IN A POSITIVE LIGHT. FINALLY, YOU KNOW, I WENT TO BEIJING IN 1995 AND TOOK ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT OVER WOMEN'S RIGHTS. SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN WANT ME TO GO. THEY SAID, OH, IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD. MY FEELING IS YOU HAVE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT I BELIEVE ARE UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS. WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. COUNTRIES THAT DON'T GIVE WOMEN EQUAL RIGHTS ARE COUNTRIES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ADVERSARIAL TO US. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AS PART OF OUR MESSAGE AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE VALUE OUR DAUGHTERS AND OUR SONS. WE RESPECT WOMEN AND MEN. WE HAVE BROKEN THOSE BARRIERS. YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER WAS BORN BEFORE WOMEN COULD VOTE. NOW HER DAUGHTER IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT. LET'S GO OUT AND DO IT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >> I NEED YOUR HELP TO GET THERE. >> THANK YOU. >> WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. >> OH, NO. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL? DID YOU EVER HAVE A DANCE OR PARTY OUT HERE? >> EVERY YEAR. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THIS IS WENDY. >> HI. SO GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, I'M HAVING THE BEST TIME. HI. HOW ARE YOU? OH. THANK YOU. GOOD FOR YOU. HI. [INAUDIBLE] >> I'M FOR IT DEFINITELY. THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING. HI. HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU? I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE STILL THE HEALTHCARE BOY? YOU KNOW WHAT? TURN AROUND. YOU BOTH BE IN THE PICTURE. RIGHT THERE. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK RIGHT THERE, DEAR. THERE WE GO. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU. OH. I NEED YOUR HELP. THANKS SO MUCH. THANKS FOR COMING. >> YOU'RE WELCOME. >> I BELIEVE IN IMMIGRATION REFORM AND TOUGHEN BORDER SECURITY. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> I KNOW, BUT WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE COUNTRIES TO THE SOUTH, HELP THEM GENERATE MORE JOBS FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO GET TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON EMPLOYEERS, BUT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALREADY HERE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM. >> [INAUDIBLE] . >> I AM IMPRESSED WITH HER. >> BACK HERE, MAN WITH A CAMERA. >> WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> [INAUDIBLE] >> GREAT TO SEE YOU. MAN WITH THE CAMERA. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW ARE YOU? >> [INAUDIBLE] >> THANKS FOR BEING A DEMOCRAT. >> GOOD LUCK. >> GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE. HI. >> SURE. >> HI. >> YOU ARE THE PERSON OF MY CHOICE. >> I TELL YOU WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE THIS TIME. STICK TOGETHER, WE'LL DO IT. >> HI, SENATOR. >> GREAT TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU? HI. >> AWESOME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> WANT TO TURN AROUND? GET A PICTURE? >> OH. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. >> DO IT AGAIN. >> THERE YOU GO. >> THIS IS SARAH. >> SARAH. >> PLEASED TO HAVE YOU HERE. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> I LOVE THAT I AM FLATTERED. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> EXCELLENT. DOES SHE LIVE IN BOSTON? >> [INAUDIBLE] >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> SENATOR, THIS IS -- >> THANK YOU. WITH YOUR HELP WE'LL DO IT. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY? >> I HAVE WANTED TO MEET YOU SO BADLY. >> THANK YOU. >> YOU WOULD BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. >> I WILL DO MY BEST FOR YOU. I PROMISE YOU THAT. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> TELL BILL I SAID HI. >> GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> HILLARY. I'M SO GLAD TO MEET YOU. YOU ARE THE MOST EXPERIENCED CANDIDATE RUNNING. >> IT'S THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF BANKRUPTCY, PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL BILLS, WHO HAVE INSURANCE. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> I'M SO SORRY. >> I HOPE YOU ARE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. >> WITH YOUR HELP. WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL GET THERE. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> SO SWEET. >> THEY ARE WAITING FOR YOU. >> WE'RE SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. >> HOW OLD ARE YOUR DAUGHTERS? >> SIX AND EIGHT. >> GREAT. THANKS FOR COMING. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING. >> TAKE OUR PICTURE. >> THANK YOU. >> TRY ONE MORE. JUST TO MAKE SURE. DO IT ONE MORE TIME. >> THEY ARE WAITING OUTSIDE. >> HI. LOVE TO HAVE YOUR HELP. THANK YOU BOTH. HOW ARE YOU? >> SURE. IS IT A GOOD ONE? >> [INAUDIBLE] . >> HI. >> WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> [INAUDIBLE] >> THANKS FOR COMING UP. >> I WAS HERE IN JANUARY, NOVEMBER. >> GOOD. I NEED YOU. WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER. >> HI. [INAUDIBLE] >> OBSERVATION, ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW? WHAT DO YOU USE FOR THE INSULATION? >> [INAUDIBLE] >> THAT'S GREAT. THANKS FOR DOING THAT. WE CAN CREATE A BIG MARKET. WE ARE JUST NOT DOING IT. LAST MONTH I SAID I WANTED TO HAVE A GREEN BUILDING FUND TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUILD ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS. I FIGURE IF WE PUT IT ON THE PUBLIC SIDE WE CREATE A MARKET BECAUSE A LOT OF PRIVATE SECTOR PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO DO IT. >> THANKS. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> I WAS ONE OF THE FIVE TEACHERS WAITING TO ASK YOU A TEACHER. >> OH. >> I ENJOYED YOUR DISCUSSION. >> WELL, THANK YOU, AND YOU KNOW, I AM VERY PROUD OF PEOPLE WHO TEACH. I'M GOING TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT YOU. >> HERE. >> THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. OH MY GOSH. >> CAN YOU SAVE THAT FOR ME? >> THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU. THANKS. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU FOR RUNNING. >> THANK YOU. I NEED YOUR HELP TO DO IT. >> THANK YOU. >> WELL, I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST FOR YOU. >> THIS IS MY GOOD FRIEND. >> HI, BOB. I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. >> PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. THIS IS MY DAUGHTER. SHE IS SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU. >> OH. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL GIRL. >> THIS IS WILLIAM. >> IF YOU WERE DISSTRACTED, HE WAS THE ONE MAKING NOISE. >> OH, NO. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> [INAUDIBLE] >> THANK YOU. >> I'M GLAD YOU ARE HERE. >> GLAD TO BE HERE. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET BACK TO DOING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> EXCELLENT. HI, EVERYBODY. THAT'S OKAY. >> THANKS FOR JOINING US. >> THERE'S ONE. THERE WE GO. THANK YOU. >> EVERYONE STEPPED IN FRONT OF ME WHEN YOU WERE SIGNING. MY HUSBAND WANTED TO -- HE CAN'T SEE. THESE GUYS WON'T GET OUT OF THE WAY. >> WHERE IS HIS CAMERA? WHERE IS HE? >> COME OVER HERE. THANK YOU. >> CAN YOU SEE HER NOW? >> YOU ARE SUCH A SWEET PERSON. THANK YOU. >> GOT IT? >> WE HAVE TO GET GOING. >> THANK YOU ALL. >> THIS IS THE FINAL STOP ON THIS CAMPAIGN SWING THROUGH NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.

EVERYBODY THINKS OF AS AS BEING VERY UNFRIENDLY AND STOIC PEOPLE. >> I'VE BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE IS MUCH MORE SOUTHERN AND HOSPITABLE BECAUSE THE IMAGE YOU HAVE. SERIOUSLY, THE IMAGE SINCE I'VE BEEN COMING BACK AND FORTH OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. MY FIRST IMPRESSION BEFORE I WOULD HAVE COME HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFICULT PLACE TO MAKE FRIENDS. IT IS NOT AT ALL. >> IT IS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. THERE ARE A LOT OF REAL GOOD PEOPLE HERE. MOST PEOPLE THINK OF US AS 500 YEARS AGO, WHEN YOU HAD TO BE BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT TRUST ANYBODY. WE WERE ALL CRIMINALS WHEN WE CAME HERE. >> LIKE MY FAMILY TREE. >> THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS. THEY CAME FROM ENGLAND AND THEY SENT WHAT THEY CALLED A RIFFRAFF GUESS WHAT? WE TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT. >> YES YOU DID. >> GOD CHANGED US. I AM REALLY, I AM SO GLAD TO MEET YOU. I'VE HEARD SUCH GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU. >> THOSE EARL THE TRUE THINGS. >> I WANT TO HEAR THE BAD ONES. >> FROM SUE. YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER? SUE AND I WERE IN COLLEGE TOGETHER. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IS FUNNY ABOUT THAT. IRAN INTO HER ABOUT A YEAR AGO I GUESS. IN THE SPRING. SHE WAS -- WHITE SHE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE? BECAUSE SHE IS FROM HERE. >> THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> ALL THE TIME I KNEW YOU WERE FROM HERE, I JUST THOUGHT YOU IN ARKANSAS. >> THAT WAS MY HOPE TO BE IN ARKANSAS. >> I DID NOT KNOW THAT EITHER. >> HOW ABOUT THAT? WE ARE MAKING THE PILGRIMMAGE TODAY. A CHRISTINE, NICE TO SEE YOU. SUE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THE CROWD HERE TODAY. >> HI, WHAT IS YOUR NAME? >> THIS IS ALEXANDRA. >> ALEXANDER, OUR YOU DOING? WHICH MUSTANGS? DEUTCH YOUR AYMAN? >> THE GIRLS HAD A GREAT TIME. IT WAS WONDERFUL. THEY LEARNED A LOT OF STUFF. >> YOU ARE NOT GETTING INTO ANY TROUBLE? >> NO. SO WHAT DID YOU DO IN ENVIRONMENTS OF HIM? THE WE HAD A LOT OF HIKES. >> A LOT OF SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS. >> A LOT OF THE NIGHTS WE HAD A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. BUILDING A BRIDGE. >> TEAM WORK TYPE THINGS. WHAT ELSE? YOU DID A BUNCH OF THINGS. >> WE WOULD LEARN HOW TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER BETTER AND STUFF. >> TELL MR. HUCKABEE ABOUT HOW YOU DID THE UNDERGROUND --. >> WE DID IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD SITUATION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE STARTED YELLING AT US. LIKE WE WERE THE SLAVES. >> THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, LIKE THE KIDS HAD TO GO FROM ONE SPOT TO ANOTHER. >> IT ALL THAT THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT. SO ON YOUR NATURE TRAIL, HIKES AND STUFF DID YOU LEARN ABOUT THE LEAVES AND THE TREES? DID YOU EAT THEM? >> YES. >> WHAT WERE THEY? >> THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO FROM NOW ON? STAY IN THE WOODS AND EAT. YOUR MOTHER WILL SAY BREAKFAST. WE WILL GIVE YOU SOME TREES. OUTED TASTE? >> IT WAS DIFFERENT. >> YOU CAN SAVON GROCERIES. JUST SEND THEM OUT IN THE WOODS.

LET ME ASK YOU, IS THIS LIKE A CAR SHOW OR SOMETHING GOING ON? >> THEY HAVE THE ANTIQUE CAR SHOW GOING ON TODAY. WE LIVE ON 33 ACRES. ALL OF THE PARKING IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THOSE TREES. IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHOWS. >> WHEN I FIRST CAME UP AND SAW ALL THESE CARS I SAID, GOOD HEAVENS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO HANDLE THAT? THEN I REALIZED THERE HERE FOR THE CARS. IT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU TO DO THIS CHRIS. SUSAN, I KNOW HER. >> SHE IS IN MY BIBLE CLASS. >> I WOULD BE GLAD TO. YOU BET. BY THE WAY, I SAW CORNBREAD.

THOSE WERE POPULAR SHIRTS. THEY ARE COLLECTORS' ITEMS NOW. THEY WILL BE UNE-BAY SOON. >> THEY WILL GO TO THE NATURAL ARCHIVE SIN. >> THEY CAN E-BAY THEM. LET'S HOPE IT HAS MORE VALUE. >> THEY WILL. I AM POSITIVE. >> NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING UP TODAY. >> YOU WERE TELLING, YOU DELIVER THE GUEST. >> I AM NOT SURE WHAT THEY WOULD CALL ME. THEY MAY SAY I'M THE GUY THAT RAN THE CHURCH SERVICE. IT IS A WONDERFUL CONGREGATION. IT WAS NOT POLITICAL AT ALL. THE MESSAGE WAS REALLY BASED ON HOW SOME OF THE WORST THINGS IN OUR LIFE CONTRACTED BE THE BEST THINGS. IT IN THE THE THE WHOLE PROCESS OF TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPENING TO HIM, IT SAVED HIS ENTIRE NATION. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] >> IT IS BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, MAKING A PERSON HOLE. >> WE ARE IN PUBLIC IS DETERMINED BY WHAT WE ARE IN PRIVATE. BUT THE PRIVATE PART OF THIS IS REALLY WHO WE ARE. IT IS NOT HOW WE LEARN TO BEHAVE, IT IS HOW WE ARE WHEN NOBODY'S LOOKING. THAT IS PROBABLY THE BEST DEFINITION OF CHARACTER. >> I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE. >> IT IS NOT ORIGINAL WITH ME. BUT IT IS SO PROFOUND. ABSOLUTELY. I DID NOT INVENT THAT. THEY BEAT ME TO IT. >> ON YOUR CAMPAIGN STOPS, SUNDAY I AM SURE DO YOU SEEK OUT OR ARE YOU INVITED TO A LOT OF CHURCHES? BEAT MOST OF THEM I AM INVITED. IT IS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. I'M GOING TO GO TO CHURCH SOMEWHERE ON SUNDAY ANYWAY. I WILL E THERE TEND OR IF THE CHURCH KNOWS I AM IN THE AREA, THEY WILL INVITE ME. THERE'S A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE SUPPORTERS OF ME TO GO TO THE CHURCH. HE HAD A WEAK MOMENT AND BROKE DOWN AND SAID OKAY. I AM SURE HE REGRETS IT NOW. >> I GUESS THEY WILL FIND OUT. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> I AM FROM THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU TO. >> THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. >> WITH A FAIR TAX DOES IT REPLACES THE CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE, WHICH IS A TAX ON INCOME AND EARNINGS AND REPLACES WITH A CONSUMPTION TAX AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ON WHAT YOU EARNED, WHETHER IT IS THROUGH WAGES OR DIVIDENDS FOR INVESTMENTS, SAVINGS. YOU PAY TAX AT THE POINT OF RETAIL CONSUMPTION AND THE REASON THAT THERE IS A JED THEN IT IS FIRST OF ALL, IT CREATES THE TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTS. EMPOWERS PEOPLE TO HAVE A SHOT AT REACHING THE NEXT ROUND AND NOT BEING PENALIZED FOR TRYING TO GET AHEAD. IT HAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE IN THAT YOU ELIMINATE THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. EVERYBODY AND SUPPING TEXAS THIS WAY, SO YOU DON'T HAVE THIS MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR SHUTTLE ECONOMY THAT IS NOT TAXED. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT $10 TRILLION OF U.S. CAPITOL PARKED OFFSHORE THAT OUGHT TO BE IN AMERICA. IT IS NOT BECAUSE COMPANIES HAVE MOVED IT AWAY TO AVOID THE CORPORATE TAX STRUCTURE. OUR CORPORATE TAXES ARE HIGHER THAN THAT OF FRANCE, SO WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAXES IN THE WORLD. THAT USES JOBS, JUICES CAPITAL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. $10 TRILLION, IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT CAME BACK TO AMERICA AND BECAME A TAX PAYMENT. THE REASONABLE FAIR TAX IS DESIGNED BY SOME OF THE LEADING ECONOMISTS IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING A WAY THAT WOULD BE THE MOST EQUITABLE AND IN POWER IN A WAY TO HAVE A TAX STRUCTURE, UNLIKE THE ONE WE HAVE NOW. >> ALSO ANY HEALTH INITIATIVE HE MIGHT SUPPORT. >> WRIGHT. THE KEY THING WE HAVE TO DO IS TO START MOVING TOWARD A TRUE HEALTH SYSTEM RATHER THAN A DISEASES THEM. OUR CURRENT MODEL IS WHAT IS WRONG AND IF WE ONLY THROW MONEY AT IT WE ARE GOING TO EXACERBATE THE HUGE PROBLEM FOR GO 80% OF OUR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES GOES TO CHRONIC DISEASE, SO WHAT WE REALLY HAVE IS THIS DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF HEALTH EXPENSES GOING TO DEAL WITH THINGS THAT WE CAN PREVENT OR CURE BUT RATHER THAN HAVE THE PROPENSION BASED SYSTEM, WE HAVE AN INTERVENTION BASE SYSTEM. WE WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ARE REALLY SICK AND THEN WE ENTER INTO THE EQUATION WITH EXTENSIVE TREATMENT. WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS THE PREVENTIVE CARE SIDE TO AVOID GETTING TO THOSE PLACES WHERE A PERSON IS IN THE THENCE STAGES OF DISEASE AND THEN IN OTHER WORDS THE CHALLENGE IS NOT CAN WE AWARD COVERAGE, THE CHALLENGE IS WILL WE PUT THE FOCUS ON PREVENTION RATHER THAN INTERVENTION? >> DO YOU MANDATE YEARLY PHYSICIANS? >> I AM HESITANT TO START MANDATING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN TO GO TO THE DOCTOR. THE BETTER THING TO DO RATHER THAN FORCE TO DO SOMETHING IS GIVE YOU INCENTIVES FOR MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE, PEOPLE WHO MAINTAIN NORMAL BODY WEIGHT SHOULD HAVE A DISCOUNT ON THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE. THE COVERAGE OUGHT TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WHENEVER I HAVE, I HAVE -- THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE WILL MAKE IS TO GIVE EVERYBODY A CARD OR DID HE GET ALL THEY WANT AND NEVER COST THEM A THING. THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT, IMAGINE IF WE DID THAT CONCEPT WITH GROCERIES AND WE DECIDED, SOME PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY SO LET'S MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GETS A GROCERY CARD. YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORES WITH YOUR CARD. YOU CAN PUT ANYTHING IN THE BASKET HE WON, AS OFTEN AS YOU WANT, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A CARD. WHAT WE DO IN THIS COUNTRY? WOULD YOU EVER AGAIN SHOP FOR A BARGAIN? WOULD YOU USE COUPONS? WOULD YOU PICK THE HAMBURGER OVER THE RABBI? BOUEY GET THE MOST EXPENSIVE THINGS AND LOTUS ARE BASKETS UP BECAUSE WE COULD. IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND CAN SAY THAT IS A GREAT MODEL, LET'S GO TO THAT. OBVIOUSLY WOULD BANKRUPT THIS. IF WE GO TO THE SYSTEM WHERE EVERYONE IN AMERICA GIBSON INTEREST CARD, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THEIR HEALTH CAR IS COSTING GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN? IT WILL BANKRUPT THE COUNTRY, SO THE IDEA IS, THE DOCTORS NEED TO WORK NOT FOR YOUR BOSS OR YOUR EMPLOYER, NOT FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND NOT FOR THE GOVERNMENT. THEY NEED TO WORK FOR YOU AND AS AN INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER I NEED TO HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS IS COSTING. I AM GOING TO PAY A PORTION OF IT, JUST LIKE IT WOULD WITHER IT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE I'VE HEARD -- THE JOHN STOSSEL. IF WE HAVE CAR INSURANCE TO COVER THE BIG THINGS, BUT WHAT IF OUR CORE INSURANCE COVERED GASOLINE, WILL CHANGES, WHIPPER PLAGUE REPLACEMENTS, CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT WOULD END UP COSTING? IF YOU DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING FREE GASOLINE AS PART OF YOUR COVERAGE IT WOULD BE A DISASTER. WHATEVER HEALTH PLAN THERE NEEDS TO BE TO PIECES. ONE IS, COVERAGE FOR THE CATASTROPHIC THINGS. NOBODY SHOULD BE WORRIED TO DEATH THAT THEY GET CANCER THERE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHERE THEY GET THE TUMOR TAKEN OUT OR EAT. EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT BUT WHAT I'M HEARING PEOPLE ADVOCATE IS THIS ALL YOU NEED BUFFET OF HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AND YOU SHOW UP WITH YOUR CARD AND THAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING. >> I DON'T SEE ANYTHING -- ON INTERNATIONAL. [INAUDIBLE] >> THERE'S A VERY EXTENSIVE SPEECH THAT I JUST GAVE, IT IS ON MY WEBSITEED MIKE HUCKABEE.COM. IT IS A LOT MORE AFFIRMATION THAT I CAN GET INTO TODAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR READING. OTHER ISSUES ON THE WEBSITE TO, BUT THAT WENT ON THEIR READY BECAUSE IT WAS A SPEECH DELIVERED ON FOREIGN POLICY AT THE SENATOR FOR STRATEGIC INTERNATIONAL STUDIES IN WASHINGTON. THE THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF THE ABBREVIATED CLIFF NOTES VERSION IS THE, WHILE ALL THIS WANT TO GET OUT THE WAR AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THEIR VICTORIOUSLY, PAWNER [BLEEP] IF WE LEAVE BEFORE WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE MISSION OF BRINGING STABILITY, THERE WILL BE LONG TERM DEVASTATING IMPACT AND RESULTS. FIRST OF ALL IT WILL CREATE A COMPLETE CHAOS, NOT JUST IN IRAQ BUT IN THE REGION. BITTED THEY WILL DO, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WAR IS ABOUT WILL PURSUE WHOEVER GIVE THIS UP LOSES. LOSING A WAR AS DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COUNTRY THAT LOSES IT. CONSEQUENCES FIRST OF ALL TO EMPOWER THE ENEMY, BUT SECOND OF ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES IF YOU BREAK THE WILL AND SPIRIT OF YOUR MILITARY. AND A KEY TO THAT, IT WILL TAKE GENERATIONS TO BUILD IT BACK UP AND WE CAN AFFORD THAT. IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR A LONG, LONG TIME AND FRANKLY TO PUT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IN THE POSITION WHERE THEY WILL BE LESS SAFE IF WE DO THAT. THANK YOU. STEED THERE IS ANOTHER FAMILY OVER HERE WHO WANTS TO ME YOU. >> I WANTED TO MEET -- SHE WANTS TO MEET YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> ARE YOU GOING TO? MIKE HUCKABEE, SO NICE TO SEE YOU. >> WE ENJOYED HAVING YOU. IT WAS REALLY NICE. >> I HOPE TO GET TO COME BACK AND BE THERE AGAIN. THE FIRST INVITATION IS NICE, BUT IF YOU GET INVITED BACK IN HIS NICE. >> YOU WILL GET INVITED BACK. >> I APPRECIATE YOU COMING YEAR. >> I AM CONCERNED ABOUT OUR DISCRETIONARY BUDGET FOR GUILLE WILL WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON SYSTEMS -- WHAT WILL YOU DO TO COMBAT THIS? THE EULACE HAVE THE SAME QUESTION. TO HAVE DESCRIPTOR SOMETHING? I GOT THE SAME QUESTION THREE TIMES, EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LIKE THAT. SAYS THE QUESTION IS THE SAME I WOULD BE THE SAME ANSWER. WHERE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING, NOT JUST ONE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. WE NEED TO LOOK IT EVERYTHING AND ONLY SPEND MONEY THAT WE CAN JUSTIFY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF TAXPAYERS AS WELL AS NATIONAL DEFENSE. THERE A LOT OF THINGS FOR THEIR TOTAL BUDGET THAT REALLY NEED TO BE REPRIORITIZE. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THE DEFENSE BUDGET REPRESENTS 3.8% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. OUR HEALTH EXPENDITURES REPRESENT 17% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. BECAUSE WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON CHRONIC DISEASE, SO THAT IS ANOTHER THING WE OUGHT TO LOOK GAD AND IT HAS A FAR GREATER BUDGETARY IMPACT ON AMERICA'S VOTES THAN THE ENTIRE DEFENSE BUDGET SO EVERYTHING OUGHT TO GET SCRUTINIZE. >> WHAT ABOUT -- WOULD YOU CUT THAT? BE EVERYTHING. WHY WOULD WE PICK ON JUST ONE THING? BE I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT SYSTEM. >> I OF BOOKS TALLER THAN ME THAT I HAVE TO GET THROUGH. >> THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE UNDER REAGAN SUGGESTED THAT SHOULD BE A WEAPON SYSTEM THAT WE SHOULD USE. >> I AM SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO REEXAMINE. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET THAT NEED TO BE GIVEN A HARD LOOK AND I'M SURE THAT IS ONE OF THEM, BUT NOT THE ONLY ONE. >> REICHERT CUZ. >> THANK YOU. >> ON YOUR WEBSITE EVERY NIGHT. I AM OVERWHELMS. I'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN. >> THEIR RUNG. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. WE NEED TO GIVE YOU QUOTED. >> GWEN MOORE GENTLEMAN. >> I WAS OVERWHELMED REALLY. YOUR IDEAS, MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION. I HAVE BEEN SPREADING THE WORD IN MY AREA. IT IS EXCITING. ONCE THEY READ IN THE UNDERSTAND , THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. >> WE NEED MORE OF YOU. THANK YOU. >> HE CAME UP FROM CONNECTICUT KIRK. >> THEY DID NOT BELIEVE WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU ARE. >> I MADE IS SET TO COME TO CONNECTICUT. >> DID I TELL YOU WHAT A PHENOMENAL FATHER YOU HAVE? DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE? >> I WAS AN ORIGINAL DANCER IN BENSE THEN. >> I GREW UP WITH THAT. >> MY DANCING PARTNER WITH JENN. IT WAS RICK AND JAN. >> MONEY WAS NOT A BIG ISSUE THEN. WHAT WE ARE. >> TELL ME SOME OF THE ARDIS C WHILE YOU RATHER. >> ONE THAT I HUNG AROUND WITH WAS BUBBLY THERE IN. BOBBY DARON. THEY KNEW HE WAS THE GUY, THE SAME AS YOU. >> HE WOULD BE THE FRANK SINATRA OF VEGAS IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY. >> I ACTUALLY PICKED UP PAUL ANKA ON HIS FIRST VISIT TO AMERICA. BRIDGE POUR CONNECTICUT. MY FATHER WAS A CAR DEALER. I WENT IN A CONVERTIBLE TO A TRAIN STATION TO PICK UP PAUL LOOK AT TO BRING IN TO THE RADIO STATION. I WAS THE GUY THAT DROVE HIM AROUND. WHEN HE WAS IN TOWN. THAT IS AN AMAZING STORY IN ITSELF. I MET HIM IN A CASINO SIXERS SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND HE REMEMBERED. >> YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR IS A MUSICIAN RIGHT? >> THERE IS VERY. >> THAT IS VERY GOOD MEN FROM BOSTON. >> IS THIS MONTH? >> YES, YOU CAN HAVE THIS? >> THIS IS GOT TO GET ON THE WEB SITE. DID YOU GET THAT ON TAPE? >> I AM HOLDING YOU TEAR PLEDGE. >> I WAS SPEECHLESS ON THAT. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. VIEWER OKAY. >> MY FINAL STORY. YOU'LL THIS PRESSLEY WAS ON THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW. I WENT TO ED SULLIVAN'S HOME IN SOUTHBURY CONNECTICUT. THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR WAS VICTOR BORGE. THEY LIVE NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER AND I WAS INVITED TO THE PARTY. ELVIS WAS THERE. >> YOU MET ELVIS? WHAT YEAR? SPEECH DID YOU SHEIKH HANDS WITH ALL THIS? >> HE IS GOING TO BE ALL OVER YOU BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER. >> I AM JUMPING INTO THE STORY. WE MOVED TO ARKANSAS FROM MEMPHIS. I MEANT -- ELVIS WHEN TORT CHURCH. HE DID NOT MAKE THE CHOIR. >> WAS IT THE ASSEMBLY OF GOD CHURCH? >> THE ASSEMBLY OF GOD CHURCH. >> HE DID NOT MAKE THE CHOIR. >> THAT IS A TOUGH CHOIR. >> YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS. >> I HAVE A CADILLAC PURCHASE BY ALL THIS. THAT IS A PIECE OF IT. AND YOU CAN HAVE IT. >> YOU OUGHT TO SEE, HIS OFFICE IS A MUSEUM. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. IF YOU DON'T GET SOME OF THOSE CARS ON DISPLAY AND THAT OF THE BOXES, I AM GOING TO COME STEAL THEM. HE IS THAT SIGNED GUITARS BY EVERYBODY IN THE BUSINESS AND HE HAS THEM SITTING IN BOXES ON THE FLOOR OF HIS OFFICE. IT IS A CRIME. >> I AM BUSY. >> HE IS BUSY, THAT'S RIGHT. >> THIS IS FUN. CAMPAIGNING IS FUN. >> OF COURSE IT IS. >> YOU LIKE MASSACHUSETTS. TEN NEMO -- THANK YOU FOR THIS FROM THE MOMENT. >> THE LITTLE ONE IS FOR MY DAD. THAT ONE IS PURSUE. >> NICE TO MEET YOU. >> THANKS FOR COMING OUT. >> WHY DID YOU COME TODAY? DID YOU DO THE COOKING TODAY? >> MY WIFE. >> WAS VERY NICE OF YOU TO HAVE US. I APPRECIATED SO MUCH. YOU HAVE A GREAT FATHER-IN-LAW. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT. >> MY DAD IS NOT TOO BAD EITHER. >> GOOD LUCK. IS THIS YOUR DAD? >> NO. IT IS TOO BAD HE IS SLEEPING RIGHT NOW. >> THAT IS WHAT I HEARD. THANK YOU GLENN. >> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. >> ALRIGHT. >> THIS IS DENNIS. >> NIGH, THANKS FOR COMING TODAY I NEED TO GIVE THAT TO DRAKE. I AM AFRAID HE WILL THINK IT IS GOING TO THE OFFICE, BUT IT ISN'T. I WILL BE IN YOUR CAR, SO THAT IS GOOD. >> YOU ARE GOING TO STOP ABORTION. HOW WOULD YOU DO IT? >> USE SIMPLY OF -- I AM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN? THE I STOLE THIS QUESTION FROM A NEWSWEEK COLUMN. IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ABORTION ILLEGAL, THEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE. >> IF YOU DID ANYTHING, IT WOULD BE WITH -- RATHER THAN GET INTO ALL THAT, I THINK IT MISSES THE POINT. THE POINT IS, THERE'S A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN SLAVERY WAS LEGAL. JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVED IT, CERTAIN PEOPLE BELIEVED CERTAIN PEOPLE -- I DON'T THINK SLAVERY IS A GOOD THING AND THE POINT WAS WE HAD TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE THE DRED SCOTT DECISION, WHICH WAS A HORRIBLE MARK ON AMERICAN HISTORY THAT SAID SOME PEOPLE WERE NOT AS VALUABLE AS OTHERS, IF THERE'S KEN WAS OF A DIFFERENT COLOR. NOBODY I KNOW WOULD BELIEVE THAT TODAY. IT IS THE SAME KIND OF PROCESS WHEN YOU COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE DON'T BELIEVE IN A PERSON SHOULD BE DEEMED LESS VALUABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN, SHOULD WE DEAN THEM LESS VALUABLE BECAUSE OF THE POINT GESTATION, AND THEN GETS THE POINT OF, AT WHAT POINT DOES A PERSON BECOME A HUMAN? A FEW YEARS AGO THE TEST WAS VIABILITY. THE FIDELITY -- WE HAVE BABIES BORN NOW REGULARLY THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT BUT BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCES IN NEONATAL CARE OUR CHILDREN ARE BORN THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN. SO VIABILITY IS NO LONGER A VALID METHOD OF SAYING THIS IS HOW WE MAKE THAT DETERMINATION IS IT A LIFE OR IS IT NOT AND WHAT DOES IT BECOME A LIFE? BIOLOGICALLY IT BECOMES A LIFE AT CONCEPTION. AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE 46 CHROMOSOMES. SO FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IF THEY SAY I AM A PERSON WHO THINKS WE OUGHT TO JUDGE THINGS BY SIZE, IT IS ALWAYS AMAZING TO ME. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WE SHOULD NEVER BELIEVE IN CREATION, EVERYTHING BASED ON ACCEPTED SCIENCE. AT THAT IS THE CASE WE SHOULD BE PRO-LIFE BECAUSE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR. >> I HAVE A QUESTION. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT RELIGION AND POLITICS IN WHEN-ISSUED AND WHEN THEY SHOULD NOT INTERCEPT? >> IF THEY ARE A PERSON OF DEEP FAITH, LET US KNOW THAT. IF YOU ARE NOT PAID PERSON OF FAITH AT ALL, JUST TELL US. I THINK THE KEY IS CANDOR AND HONESTY. I WAS ASKED BY BILL MARSHALL ABOUT THE CONGRESSMAN FROM CALIFORNIA THE WAS AND EIGHT IS. I THINK I SURPRISED HIM WITH MY ANSWER. I HAVE FAR MORE RESPECT FOR PETE STAR WHO IS HONEST ABOUT HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS THAN I DO SOMEBODY WHO PLANS TO BE A CHRISTIAN BUT THEY DON'T LIVE LIKE IT. I OF A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THERE'S SOMETHING AND THEY ARE NOT. BEATS DARK DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE SOMETHING. HE SAYS I JUST DON'T LEAVE. THAT IS FINE. THIS IS AMERICA AND YET EVERY RIGHT TO RUN FOR CONGRESS, WHETHER HE BELIEVES ARE NOT. >> WHERE IT IS THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND? >> IT DOESN'T. >> THE ONLY TIME IT IN IS -- THE SECOND AMENDMENT WOULD AND IF YOU VIOLATED BY SHOOTING SOMEBODY. >> IN TERMS OF WEAPONS. I AM JUST CURIOUS -- CURIOUS. THE PART ABOUT ASSAULT RIFLES. >> MOST PEOPLE USE THAT TERM HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. I WAS ON AN EDITORIAL BOARD WITH THE GROUP OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A SEMI-AUTOMATIC. EIG DECK HUNT WITH ONE, A SHOTGUN, A SEMI-AUTOMATIC. I SAID WE PROBABLY MEAN IS NO ONE NEEDS AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON TO HUNT WITH. >> WHERE DO GO FROM SAY THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC, AUTOMATIC MISSILE? IT MUST THEN SOMEWHERE OR ELSE. >> IF YOU ARE A LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN AND ON THE WORD INSEL'S FEW MS. USE IT. >> THERE ARE A FEW MORE PEOPLE WANT YOU TO MEET. I KNOW YOU HAVE TO LEAVE. >> I HAVE TO BE AT THE AIRPORT IN BOSTON AT 1:00. ENZI, NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE JOB THIS MORNING. REALLY GOOD VOICE. THIS IS MY SON, NICHOLAS. >> NICHOLAS, IT IS BETTER YOU DO IT THEN THE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OLD THING, AND IS STILL GOING AROUND. IT IS GOOD TO SEE. I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR MUSIC TODAY, IT WAS FANTASTIC. >> GOVERNOR I JUST WANT TO SHEIKH YOUR HAND. >> WHAT IS YOUR ASSURANCE THEY? BE IT IS JUST A LOCAL PLACE. I WAS AT THE FLEA MARKET ACROSS THE WAY. YOU ARE AT THE TAIL END OF THE BUNCH OF OLD CARS. >> I WISH YOU DIDN'T SAY A BUNCH OF OTHER OLD THINGS. MIKE HUCKABEE. NICE TO SEE YOU. >> WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY? THE CHANGE THE TAX SYSTEM. SERIOUSLY. IT IS BECAUSE WE ACHIEVED SO MANY JOBS AWAY WITH THE TAXES THAT PENALIZED PRODUCTIVITY. WE HAVE $10 TRILLION OF U.S. CAPITAL OFFSHORE. IT IS BECAUSE OUR TAX SYSTEM MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO KEEP IT HERE. WHEN DAIMLER CHRYSLER IMMERGED, WHERE THEY HAD FOR? EUROPE. >> WHAT ABOUT THE GAS SHORTAGE? >> AS LONG AS WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE MIDDLE EAST FOR OIL, IT WILL GET WORSE AND NEVER BETTER AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SAY WITHIN TEN YEARS WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF FOREIGN OIL AND BINDING ENERGY SOURCES TO MEET EARNINGS. >> THERE MORE GAS PRICES AROUND AROUND --. >> THEY HATE IS TOO, VENEZUELA, IRAN, RUSSIA. IN OTHER WORDS WE DON'T PRODUCE ENOUGH --. >> IT WOULD NOT WORTH IT FOR US TO STAND UP -- LAGGERS. THE WHEN NEED TO FIND SELF SUSTAINING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY DOMESTIC ENERGY SOURCES , WIND, SOLAR, ETHANOL, BIOMASS. PLENTY OF WAYS. >> WE KNOW WE HAVE TO BE RID OF GASOLINE. UNTIL WE DO SOMETHING ELSE. >> THERE IS A LIMITED SUPPLY. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO THINK WE CAN USE FOSSIL FUELS FOREVER AND EVER. WE NEED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT HAS LOWER CO2 EMISSIONS AND SOMETHING WE CAN PRODUCE THAT IS SUSTAINABLE, AND GASOLINE IS NOT. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR OWN FREEDOM WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FEED OURSELVES, IF YOU'LL OURSELVES, 54 CELLS. >> WE HAVE TO GET THE ECONOMY TURNED AROUND, BECAUSE IT IS TERRIBLE. >> IT IS GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT IS TERRIBLE FOR OTHERS. >> IF A WORKING PERSON HAS A GOOD JOB, IT IS GREAT. NICE TALKING DE. >> ARE YOU GOING TO THE CAR SHOW TODAY? >> YES. >> I APPRECIATE YOU COMING BY. >> IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. DID YOU GATHER ALL THE KIDS? >> ONE IS STILL IN THE CAR. >> I KNEW YOU HAD YOUR HANDS FULL, I DID TELL. THEN THERE, DONE THAT. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT. I APPRECIATE YOUR. [SINGING] I HOPE THE REST OF AMERICA SHARES THAT VIEW. >> WE ARE GOING TO DO ANOTHER DEBATE ON FOX NEWS. IS IT THE 21ST OF OCTOBER FOR MICHIGAN? IT IS SOMETIME IN OCTOBER. MAYBE FROM FLORIDA. HONESTLY, THERE'S SO MANY ON THE CALENDAR. I WILL BE THERE. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHRIS, I'VE SIGNED A BOOK FOR YOU AND I WANTED TO PRESENT TO YOU. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT WHO HAVE DONE. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> YOUR HUSBAND IS LESS. >> ANDY MADELL THIS. >> ANDY LOVES ME, WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED? >> IT WAS SO NICE MEETING YOU. >> I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD TRIP. >> THAT WOULD BE GREAT. WE CAN PUT THAT ON OUR WEB SITE. IODIC PICTURE, A LITTLE GIRL IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND SHE HAD A T-SHIRT MADE UP. DID YOU SEE THAT ONE? I WISH YOU COULD. >> SUE, GOOD TO SEE YOU. TALIBAN HI STEVE LOSIER BE HERE WITH YOU? THE DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WAS LESS LIKE? SHE WENT TO ATLANTIC CITY WITH SOME FRIENDS. IT BROKE MY HEART. I THINK SHE IS GOING TO TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE RED CROSS SOME TIME, MAYBE MID TO LATE OCTOBER. SHE WANTS TO BE OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ALL THE TIME. WE EXCITIVE NEED HER AT THE RED CROSS RIGHT NOW. >> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. YOU ARE KIND TO SAY THAT. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> IT DID NOT BRING YOU DID IT? >> NO IT DIDN'T, I WAS SURPRISED",2015-11-07 17:26:38,2007-09-30,Amherst,New Hampshire
http://www.c-span.org/video/?202038-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"REMARKS BY DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND NEW YORK SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON AT HER ALMA MATER, WELLESLEY COLLEGE, IN MASSACHUSETTS. IN HER SPEECH, THE SENATOR ANNOUNCES HER CAMPAIGN'S NEW EFFORT TO CULTIVATE SUPPORT NATIONALLY AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS. >> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. >> THIS IS JUST OVER 40 MINUTES. >> HI, EVERYONE. HI. [ SCREAMING AND CHEERING ] >> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE, GOOD MORNING. NICE TO SEE EVERYONE HERE TODAY. HI, EVERYONE. GUYS, YOU'RE HERE TO SEE HILLARY. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS MAYA DULGAN, AND I AM THE CAMPAIGN -- [ CHEERING ] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND I AM THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER OF WELLESLEY STUDENTS FOR HILLARY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR COMING OUT TODAY FOR THIS EXCITING AND MOMENTOUS OCCASION. I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU HAD TO DRAG YOURSELVES OUT OF BED, AND SOME OF YOU HAD TO DRAG YOURSELVES OUT OF CLASS, BUT WHAT MATTERS IS THAT WE HAVE ALL COME TOGETHER FROM COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE AREA FOR THIS IMPORTANT EVENT. SENATOR CLINTON'S DECISION TO RETURN TO WELLESLEY TO LAUNCH HILLBLAZERS SHOWS HOW MUCH SHE VALUES AND RESPECTS US. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW SENATOR, HOW MUCH WE VALUE AND RESPECT YOU. IT SHOWS THAT WE CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER, THAT YOU CARE ABOUT US AS FUTURE LEADERS OF THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT WE CARE ABOUT YOU AS THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME HOW HILLARY AS A WEALTHY ALUM INSPIRES ME, MY ANSWER IS THAT I HOPE TO LEAVE WELLESLEY HAVING UNDERGONE A SIMILAR GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION THAT SHE EXPERIENCED WHILE SHE WAS HERE. BUT WHAT IS JUST AS INSPIRING IS HOW HILLARY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER GROWTH HERE AT WELLESLEY AND BEGAN TRANSFORMING THE WORLD. AFTER GRADUATING FROM YALE LAW SCHOOL, SHE BEGAN TRANSFORMING THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN BY WORKING FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. WHEN FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON GAME GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS -- [ CHEERING ] -- SHE TRANSFORMED THEIR STATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL INTO THE SEVENTH LARGEST IN THE NATION. AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IN THE SENATE, SHE HAS TRANSFORMED THE LIVES OF HARD-WORKING, HONEST FAMILIES, BY PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR 6 MILLION CHILDREN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE TWO HOPES FOR US ALL. THE FIRST IS THAT NO MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM, NO MATTER WHAT COLLEGES WE GO TO, WE CAN EXPAND OUR MINDS AND EXPERIENCES, BELIEFS, AND UNDERSTANDINGS, JUST LIKE HILLARY DID WHILE SHE WAS AT WELLESLEY. AND I ALSO HOPE THAT WHEN WE LEAVE SCHOOL, BE IT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR OR AFTER FOUR YEARS, WE WILL BE JUST AS READY TO CHANGE THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH THE COLLEGE CANNOT ENDORSE YOU AS A POLITICAL CANDIDATE, HILLARY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW PROUD WE, THE STUDENTS ARE, HOW INSPIRED WE ARE, HOW AWED WE ARE AT ALL THAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AS THE LEADER -- AS THE LEADER OF STUDENTS FOR HILLARY HERE AT WELLESLEY, I MAKE SURE THAT WE REMIND EACH OTHER OF THIS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. WHENEVER WE ARE DISCUSSING OUR PLANS FOR EVENTS, I ASK MYSELF AND THOSE AROUND ME, WHAT WOULD HILLARY HAVE DONE IN 1968? WE REMIND OURSELVES OF HER COURAGE, HER ACTIVISM, AND HER STRENGTH. THE QUESTION INEVITABLY EVOLVES INTO WHAT WOULD HILLARY DO IN 2007? AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE NEXT QUESTION WILL BE -- WHAT WILL PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON DO STARTING IN 2008? WILL SHE CONTINUE TRANSFORMING OUR COUNTRY? YES. WILL SHE CONTINUE INSPIRING STUDENTS LIKE US? YES. WILL SHE CONTINUE CHALLENGING US AND PUSHING US TO BECOME BETTER PEOPLE AND BETTER CITIZENS? YES. AND WILL SHE BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? YES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY FRIENDS, MY FELLOW STUDENTS, I NOW PRESENT TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SENATOR HILLARY DIANE RODHAM CLINTON. >> YOU DID SUCH A GOOD JOB! OH, MY GOSH! I WAS SO IMPRESSED! WOW! THANK YOU. MY! OH, WOW. I TELL YOU, I KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DO IT TOGETHER. THIS WONDERFUL HALL THAT HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO ME OVER SO MANY YEARS, THE SITE OF A LOT OF GREAT MEMORIES FOR ME, IS A PLACE THAT I RETURN TO WITH SO MUCH LOVE AND AFFECTION. AND STANDING UP HERE WITH MAYA, LOOKING OUT AT ALL OF YOU IS JUST AN OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCE. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE HERE. AND I THANK MAYA AND EVERYONE WHO IS WORKING WITH HER HERE AT WELLESLEY, THE ENTIRE WELLESLEY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER TO SUPPORT MY CANDIDACY AND WHO PUT THIS EVENT TOGETHER TODAY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STUDENTS FROM ALL OF THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. I KNOW WE HAVE STUDENTS FROM BU AND HARVARD AND YALE AND BROWN AND OTHERS WHO HAVE TRAVELED TO BE HERE. AND WELCOME TO WELLESLEY AND WELCOME TO THIS EVENT. AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY A MIXER, BUT I HOPE YOU GET TO MEET EACH OTHER. THERE ARE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN THIS AUDIENCE, PEOPLE WHOM I HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME, BUT THERE ARE TWO THAT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE, BECAUSE THEY'VE MEANT SO MUCH TO ME IN ALL OF THE YEARS, AND THAT'S ALLEN AND ALISON SCHECTER, AND I'M SO PLEASED THAT THEY'RE HERE WITH ME. NOT ONLY DOES BEING HERE BRING BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES, BUT IT IS ALSO AMAZING TO SEE HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED -- NOT A SURPRISE -- BUT WHEN YOU COME BACK TO A PLACE THAT YOU LOVE SO MUCH AND YOU HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE IN YOUR MIND AS PART OF YOUR LIFE'S, YOU KNOW, VIDEO REEL, AND YOU COME BACK AND YOU LOOK AROUND, IT'S JUST WONDERFUL, WITH THE GROWTH OF THE COLLEGE AND EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING. YOU KNOW, BACK THEN, WHEN I WAS HERE, WE ACTUALLY HAD WEEKEND CURFEWS. AND ROUTE 9 WAS LIKE A GRAND PRIX RACETRACK ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS, AS WE WERE LITERALLY RACING DOWN THE HIGHWAY TO GET BACK IN TIME TO OBSERVE CURFEW. NOW, BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN OUR ROOMS ONLY ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS. AND WE HAD TO OBSERVE WHAT WAS CALLED THEN THE TWO FEET RULE. THAT MEANT TWO OUT OF FOUR FEET HAD TO BE ON THE FLOOR AT ALL TIMES. TRY IT SOME TIME. NOW, THAT IS A RULE THAT I AND MANY OF MY CLASSMATES BECAME ACTUALLY NOSTALGIC FOR WHEN WE HAD COLLEGE-AGE CHILDREN OF OUR OWN, BUT WHILE TIMES HAVE CLEARLY CHANGED, WHAT MAKES THIS COLLEGE SPECIAL HAS ENDURED -- THE WORLD-CLASS FACULTY AND STAFF WHO PUSH YOU AND CHALLENGE YOU, THOSE LATE NIGHTS AND LONG LUNCHES WHERE YOU CHALLENGE EACH OTHER AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER, THE COMRADERY THAT DEVELOPS WHEN SMART, AMBITIOUS, YOUNG WOMEN COME TOGETHER IN A COMMUNITY OF LEARNING. IN SO MANY WAYS, THIS ALL-WOMEN'S COLLEGE PREPARED ME TO COMPETE IN THE ALL-BOYS CLUB OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD TRY OUT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEADERSHIP STYLES, WHERE YOU COULD ASK FOR CRITIQUE AND SUPPORT FROM YOUR FRIENDS AND THE FACULTY WITH WHOM YOU HAD AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP. IT WAS A PLACE THAT TRULY DID PREPARE WOMEN TO MAKE THE BEST CHOICES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE RIGHT FOR OUR OWN LIVES. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THOUGH, WHEN I CAME TO WELLESLEY, I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS COULD HAVE IMAGINED I WOULD ONE DAY RETURN AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. BACK THEN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW FOR SURE I WOULD RETURN FOR MY SOPHOMORE YEAR. I HAD GROWN UP IN THE MIDWEST OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO. I HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THIS WHOLE GOING EAST FOR COLLEGE IDEA, AND JUST ONE MONTH AFTER I MOVED INTO MY ROOM IN STONE DAVIS, I FELT -- I FELT LIKE ALL MY WORST FEARS HAD BEEN CONFIRMED. SO MANY OF MY CLASSMATES HAD TRAVELED THE WORLD, THEY LEARNED AND SPOKE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. I WAS STRUGGLING IN MY CLASSES, IN FACT, TO THE POINT WHERE MY FRENCH PROFESSOR SAID TO ME, MADAMOSELLE, YOUR TALENTS LIE ELSEWHERE. AND I CALLED HOME -- IN THOSE DAYS, YOU CALLED COLLECT -- AND MY PARENTS TOOK THE CALL, WHICH WAS A GOOD THING, AND I SAID, I JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD DO THIS. IT WASN'T FOR ME. NOW, MY FATHER SAID THAT WAS JUST FINE. I THINK HE MISSED ME. BUT MY MOTHER, WHO NEVER GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE, WOULD NOT HEAR A WORD OF IT. SHE SAID, HILLARY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE A QUITTER, TO WHICH I'M EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT, I RESPONDED, ALL RIGHT, BUT IF I DON'T LIKE IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR, CAN I QUIT THEN? WELL, I STUCK IT OUT, AND I AM SO GLAD I DID, BECAUSE MY FOUR YEARS HERE WERE AMONG THE MOST EXHILARATING AND INFORMATIVE OF MY LIFE. AND THE FRIENDS THAT I MADE HERE HAVE BEEN THE FRIENDS OF A LIFETIME. THEY HAVE SUSTAINED AND SUPPORTED ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY ON MY JOURNEY AS I HAVE TRIED TO DO FOR THEM. AND WE STARTED THAT JOURNEY AT A TUMULTUOUS TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. WE WERE EMBROILED IN A WAR THAT MANY OF US OPPOSED. HERE AT HOME SO MANY OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS WERE MARGINALIZED AND DENIED THEIR MOST BASIC RIGHTS. WE WERE UNEASY ABOUT OUR FUTURE, UNCERTAIN ABOUT AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE WORLD, AND UNWILLING TO TRUST A GOVERNMENT THAT DIDN'T SHARE OUR VALUES. SOUNDS KIND OF FAMILIAR, DOESN'T IT? BUT WE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR WELLESLEY MOTTO NOT TO BE MINISTERED ONTO, BUT TO MINISTER, AND WE TOOK IT TO HEART, PROBABLY MORE THAN SOME OF OUR PROFESSORS AND ADMINISTRATORS AT THE TIME WOULD HAVE LIKED. WE PROTESTED THE VIETNAM WAR. WE MARCHED FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. WE FOUGHT TO BRING MORE MINORITY STUDENTS AND FACULTY TO WELLESLEY, AND AT THE END OF OUR FOUR YEARS, MY CLASSMATES CONVINCED OUR SKEPTICAL COLLEGE PRESIDENT, RUTH ADAMS, TO HAVE THE FIRST EVER STUDENT SPEAKER AT GRADUATION, AND THEN THEY CONVINCED ME TO DO THE HONORS. WELL -- WHEN THE TIME CAME, PRESIDENT ADAMS INTRODUCED ME AS -- AND I QUOTE -- ""CHEERFUL, GOOD-HUMORED, GOOD COMPANY, AND A GOOD FRIEND TO ALL OF US."" I'M AFRAID SHE PROBABLY WANTED TO TAKE IT ALL BACK ONCE I OPENED MY MOUTH. MY THOUGHTS ON THE INDISPENSABLE TASK OF CRITICIZING AND CONSTRUCTIVE PROTEST WASN'T EXACTLY HER IDEA OF A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH. NOW, WHEN I GO BACK AND READ IT TODAY, I HAVE TO ADMIT IT WASN'T THE WORLD'S MOST COHERENT ADDRESS, AND I SORT OF CRINGE WHEN I READ THAT I ACTUALLY SAID THINGS LIKE ""COMING TO TERMS WITH OUR HUMANNESS AND AUTHENTIC REALITY AND INAUTHENTIC REALITY."" TELL YOU, WELLESLEY GETS INTO YOU, AND -- BUT I STILL BELIEVE AS STRONGLY TODAY AS I DID THEN IN MY STATEMENT THAT POLITICS IS THE ART OF MAKING WHAT APPEARS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BELIEVED EVER SINCE I WAS A STUDENT HERE. THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DO THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, STARTING AFTER LAW SCHOOL, AS WHEN MAYA SAID, I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR A LAW FIRM, I DIDN'T WANT TO CLERK FOR A JUDGE. I WENT TO WORK, INSTEAD, FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, AND MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT THERE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO GET MORE KIDS INTO SCHOOL. I WENT TO NEW BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS, TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE WERE SO MANY CHILDREN IN THE CENSUS WHO DIDN'T APPEAR ON ANY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT FORMS, AND I WENT DOOR TO DOOR, AND IN HOME AFTER HOME, I FOUND CHILDREN WHO WERE BLIND OR DEAF OR IN WHEELCHAIRS, THEY WERE KEPT HOME BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS WOULDN'T OR COULDN'T ACCOMMODATE THEM. THEY WANTED TO LEARN, THEY WANTED TO SUCCEED, BUT THEY NEVER HAD THE CHANCE. I KNEW THEN THAT I WANTED TO SPEND MY CAREER BEING A VOICE FOR CHILDREN, CHILDREN PARTICULARLY WHO HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND, CHILDREN WHO DREW THE SHORT STRAW IN LIFE. I WANTED TO FIGHT TO GIVE THEM THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT I HAD GROWING UP. AND LIKE MANY OF MY CLASSMATES AND MANY OF YOU, I DID WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. NOW, THAT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY. BACK THEN, WOMEN WEREN'T ALWAYS TAKEN SERIOUSLY -- BACK THEN. WHEN I WAS FIRST DECIDING WHERE TO ATTEND LAW SCHOOL, I WAS INVITED TO GO, AFTER I HAD BEEN ADMITTED TO HARVARD AND YALE, TO A COCKTAIL RECEPTION FOR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AT THE HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. AND I KNEW A COUPLE OF THE MALE STUDENTS WHO WERE THERE, AND THEY WERE SHOWING ME AROUND, AND WE RAN RIGHT INTO PROFESSOR PAPER CHASE, LARGE, IMPOSING, THREE-PIECE SUIT, WATCH CHAIN, LOOKING DOWN AT EVERYONE. AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID, PROFESSOR SO-AND-SO, THIS IS HILLARY RODHAM. SHE'S TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN US AND OUR NEAREST COMPETITOR. AND HE LOOKED DOWN AT ME, AND HE SAID, WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T HAVE A NEAREST COMPETITOR, AND SECONDLY, WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE WOMEN. SO I DECIDED TO GO TO YALE. THERE WERE 235 STUDENTS, OF WHOM JUST 27 WERE WOMEN, AND TODAY WOMEN ARE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS IN LAW SCHOOL. AS A YOUNG LAWYER, WHEN I ONCE TOLD A COLLEAGUE THAT I WANTED TO PRACTICE LITIGATION, COURTROOM LAW, HE REPLIED THAT THIS WAS CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A WIFE. HE ASKED ME, HE ASKED ME TOTALLY SERIOUSLY, WHEN YOU'RE IN A LONG TRIAL AND YOU'RE SO BUSY, WHO WILL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CLEAN SOCKS FOR COURT? I HAD HONESTLY NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I'D ALWAYS WASHED MY OWN SOCKS, AND I HAVE BEEN THRILLED TO SEE WOMEN SERVING ACROSS AMERICA NOT ONLY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION, BUT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION, IN ACADEMIA AND SO MUCH ELSE. BUT BACK THEN, THE IDEA OF A WOMAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH DERISIVE LAUGHTER. WELL, TIMES HAVE CHANGED. DESPITE THE CHALLENGES WE FACED, WE HAVE FOUND WAYS TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY IN EVERY WAY IMAGINABLE, IN OUR PROFESSIONS, OUR COMMUNITIES, AND OUR FAMILIES. AND LOOKING AT YOUR GENERATION, I SEE THAT SAME DESIRE TO GIVE BACK. WE SAW IT ESPECIALLY AFTER SEPTEMBER 11th. WHILE THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T ASK US TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT GO SHOPPING, WHICH HARDLY RANKS UP THERE AS A CALL TO ACTION AND SACRIFICE FROM AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY HAD OTHER IDEAS. BETWEEN 2000 AND 2006, APPLICATIONS TO TEACH FOR AMERICA NEARLY TRIPLED. BETWEEN 2004 AND 2006 ALONE, APPLICATIONS TO THE AMERICORPS AVISTA PROGRAM JUMPED 50% AND IN RECENT YEARS, THE PEACE CORPS HAS SEEN THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS IN THREE DECADES. WE'VE SEEN A RESURGENCE OF ACTIVISM ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. STUDENTS AT BROWN HAVE CREATED A SUSTAINABLE FOODS INITIATIVE, ORGANIZING FARMER'S MARKETS AND CONVINCING DINING HALLS TO SWITCH TO LOCAL FOODS. STUDENTS AT TEEN STATE COLLEGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HOSTED A CONCERT TO RAISE MONEY FOR VICTIMS OF THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR. STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE WORKING TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT BY REDUCING ENERGY AND WATER USE ON CAMPUS. AND HERE AT WELLESLEY, JUST RECENTLY, STUDENTS ORGANIZED A DAY OF AWARENESS AND A RALLY TO PROTEST THE UNFAIR TREATMENT OF THE JENA SIX. THEY HAVE ALSO TRAVELED TO NEW ORLEANS TO HELP REBUILD AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING TOGETHER THROUGH A GROUP CALLED SISTERS KEEPERS, TO HELP STUDENT MOTHERS FINISH THEIR EDUCATION. AND TO THOSE WHOM I SOMETIMES HEAR ON TELEVISION SAY THAT YOUR GENERATION IS DISENGAGED, THAT YOU'RE NOT AS PASSIONATE AND COMMITTED AS WE WERE, I SAY COME TO PROVIDENCE, COME TO KEEN, COME TO DURHAM, COME TO WELLESLEY, TRAVEL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, TAKE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY THAT I HAD TO ACTUALLY MEET AND TALK WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF AMERICA, SEE HOW EVERY DAY YOU'RE STANDING UP, TAKING CHARGE, AND MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY, FOR NEARLY SEVEN YEARS, WE'VE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO HASN'T BEEN MUCH OF A PARTNER IN YOUR WORK. IF ANYTHING, HE'S ACTUALLY CREATED MORE WORK. HE'S UNDERMINED WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GAY RIGHTS AND APPOINTED SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO CHIPPED AWAY AT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, UNDERMINED EQUAL PAY, AND TURNED BACK THE CLOCK ON SCHOOL INTEGRATION, DECISIONS THAT WILL AFFECT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN FOR DECADES TO COME. HE'S CONTINUED TO WAGE A WAR IN IRAQ THAT HAS TAKEN MORE THAN 3,800 OF OUR BEST AND MOST DEDICATED, YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN, AND COST US MORE THAN $300 MILLION A DAY, A BILL THAT, AGAIN, YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE PAYING, UNLESS WE REVERSE COURSE. HE'S RUN UP OUR NATIONAL DEBT TO $9 TRILLION. SO EVERY BABY BORN TODAY STARTS LIFE WITH $30,000 OF DEBT ON HIS OR HER TINY SHOULDERS, A BIRTH TAX THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IF WE DON'T END THIS RECKLESS SPENDING. HE'S WAGED A WAR ON SCIENCE, CUTTING OFF PROMISING STEM CELL RESEARCH, BANNING HIS OWN SURGEON GENERAL FROM TALKING ABOUT CONTRACEPTION, FAILING TO ADDRESS THE THREAT OF GLOBAL WARMING THAT WE KNOW NOT ONLY COULD, BUT IS LEADING TO INCREASED STORMS AND FLOODS AND HEAT WAVES AND DROUGHTS AFFECTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA AND THE WORLD. TO PARAPHRASE ONE OF MY MOST RECENT OPPONENTS, THE PHILOSOPHER STEPHEN COLBERT -- THIS ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON FACTS, IT MAKES FACTS BASED ON DECISIONS. AS A RESULT, MY GENERATION IS IN DANGER OF BEING THE FIRST EVER TO LEAVE AMERICA WORSE OFF THAN WHEN WE FOUND IT. AND WHETHER YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENT, OR YOU DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT POLITICS, I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT YOUR GENERATION, MY DAUGHTER'S GENERATION DESERVES BETTER THAN THAT. THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE TODAY ARE NO LESS PROFOUND THAN ONES FACED BY PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS, AND YOU DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL MEET THOSE CHALLENGES HEAD ON, A PRESIDENT WHO IS COMMITTED TO YOUR FUTURE, A PRESIDENT WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN PLAY POLITICS WITH WOMEN'S HEALTH AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS, WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN -- WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN PUT IDEOLOGY OVER SCIENCE AND THE CURES AND BREAKTHROUGH OF THE FUTURE, WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN ENGAGE IN RECKLESS SPENDING AND STICK YOU WITH THE BILL, WHO WILL CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WITHOUT FEAR OR FEAR MONGERING, AND LEAVE AMERICA BETTER OFF. IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE AND THE HONOR, I WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT FOR YOU. I WILL START BY MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN SO THAT MIDDLE CLASS AND HARD-WORKING FAMILIES CAN GO. BACK WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE, MY FATHER TOLD ME, HERE'S THE DEAL, WE'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR YOUR TUITION AND BOARD, BUT ANYTHING BEYOND THAT, YOU KNOW, LIKE BUYING BOOKS, YOU PAY FOR YOURSELF. AND I'D WORKED SUMMERS AND HOLIDAYS SINCE I WAS 13, SO I WAS FINE WITH THAT. BUT WHEN I DECIDED TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL, AND I TOLD MY FATHER, HE SAID, WELL, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN FOR THAT ONE. THAT WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL. SO I KEPT WORKING, AND I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP FROM WELLESLEY, THE VITA DUTTON SCHOLARSHIP, AND I BORROWED MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT A LOW INTEREST RATE. I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOME FOR-PROFIT STUDENT LOAN COMPANY RIPPING ME AND MY FAMILY OFF, RAISING THE INTEREST RATES, OR CHANGING THE TERMS OF THE LOAN. I DIDN'T GET STUCK WITH A MASSIVE DEBT THAT WOULD HAVE DERAILED MY DREAMS OF A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, I WILL RESTORE THAT BASIC BARGAIN. I PROPOSED A NEW COLLEGE TAX CREDIT THAT WILL COVER MORE THAN 50% OF THE TYPICAL COST OF PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OR THE FULL COST OF TUITION FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE, I THINK WE SHOULD INVEST MORE IN APPRENTICESHIPS AND JOB TRAINING AND LIFE-LONG LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THERE ARE SO MANY -- THERE ARE SO MANY HARD-WORKING, YOUNG AMERICANS. I THINK YOU PROBABLY KNOW AS MANY AS I DO, WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE, BUT WHO DESERVE TO HAVE A SHOT AT A HIGH-WAGE, HIGH-SKILLED JOB, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF SHORTAGES IN HIGH-SKILLED JOBS, SO WE NEED TO START DOING MORE FOR THEM AS WELL. LET'S START CREATING THOSE JOBS BY INVESTING IN A NEW CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY AND ADDRESSING THE THREAT OF GLOBAL WARMING RIGHT NOW. WE ALL KNOW THE SCIENCE. THERE'S NO LONGER A DEBATE. GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL. IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY THREATS WE FACE. AND I WAS, AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU WERE, SO PROUD OF VICE PRESIDENT GORE WHEN HE GOT THE NOBLE PRIZE FOR RAISING THE ALARM ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING. BUT WE NEED A POLICY, AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT. I WILL CREATE A $1 BILLION GREEN BUILDING FUND TO BUILD AND RENOVATE PUBLIC BUILDINGS. WE'LL MAKE BUILDINGS GREEN AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT. I WANT TO ESTABLISH A STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND, PAID FOR BY A $50 BILLION INVESTMENT IN CLEAN, RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES, BY TAKING AWAY THE TAX SUBSIDIES FROM THE OIL COMPANIES. THEY DON'T NEED THEM TO MAKE A PROFIT. NEXT WEEK I'LL BE UNVEILING A BROAD AGENDA TO ADDRESS OUR ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING CHALLENGES, AND I'LL BE TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT THOSE ISSUES ALL NEXT WEEK. BUT TODAY'S CHALLENGES AREN'T JUST AT HOME. WE HAVE TO FACE THOSE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS. THAT HAS BEEN THE ENGINE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO TACKLE ENERGY, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT BEGINS WITH UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN THAT PIXES THE UNFUNDED MANDATE OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. AND THAT'S WHY FINALLY, WE NEED A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR CHALLENGES ARE NOT JUST HERE AT HOME. AFTER NEARLY SEVEN YEARS OF A STUBBORN, PREEMPTIVE, GO IT ALONE FOREIGN POLICY, WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US, TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD. THAT STARTS WITH BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ, AS RESPONSIBLY AND QUICKLY AS WE CAN. THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION, AND WE SHOULD NOT BE ASKING OUR BRAVE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO SERVE AS REFEREES IN THEIR SECTARIAN CONFLICTS. IT HAS TO BE DONE AS CAREFULLY AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS WITHDRAWING TROOPS. I'VE LAID OUT MY PLANS TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ AND DEMAND THAT THE IRAQIS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY, REPLACE OUR MILITARY INVOLVEMENT WITH AN INTENSIVE, DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE IN THE AREA. AND LET ME BE CLEAR, IF GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T END THIS WAR WHILE HE IS PRESIDENT, WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, I CAN. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PROBLEMS GO FAR BEYOND IRAQ. TAKE OUT THE GLOBE AND LOOK AT IT. WE HAVE ALIENATED OUR FRIENDS AND EMBOLDENED OUR ENEMIES ACROSS THE WORLD. I HAVE SAID I WON'T EVEN WAIT UNTIL I'M INAUGURATED. THE DAY AFTER I'M ELECTED, I WILL ASK DISTINGUISHED AMERICANS OF BOTH PARTIES TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD WITH A NEW MESSAGE -- THE ERA OF COWBOY DIPLOMACY IS OVER. WE'RE GOING TO START WORKING WITH PEOPLE AGAIN. AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE COME TO A RATHER OBVIOUS CONCLUSION BASED ON MY WELLESLEY EDUCATION. YOU CAN'T BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD IF NO ONE IS FOLLOWING YOU, AND WE HAVE GOT TO GET BACK TO LEADING, LEADING WITH OUR VALUES, LEADING WITH MORAL AUTHORITY, LEADING ON BEHALF OF BRINGING THE WORLD TOGETHER. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE FROM GLOBAL TERRORISM, TO GLOBAL WARMING, TO GLOBAL EPIDEMICS AND GLOBAL COMPETITION, WE CANNOT DO THIS ALL ON OUR OWN. AND I WANT TO LEAD THE WORLD, TO END THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR, AND WE NEED TO ACT IMMEDIATELY. EVERY DAY WE FAIL TO ACT IS A BETRAYAL OF OUR COMMON VALUES. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SPEED THE DEPLOYMENT OF A U.N. PEACEKEEPING FORCE. I WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE SUPPORT TO DO THE JOB WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO AND CREATE REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR ANYONE WHO CONTINUES THE BLOODSHED OR OBJECT INSTRUCTS THE PEACE PROCESS. WE NEED TO LEAD THE WORLD. TO STOP THE BRUTAL VIOLENCE IN BURMA AND INSIST THAT THE REGIME RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS, INCLUDING AUNG SAN SUU KYI. WE NEED TO LEAD THE WORLD IN FIGHTING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC THAT IS CREATING A GLOBAL GENERATION OF ORPHANS AND DESTABILIZING COUNTRIES. THAT'S WHY I WAS PROUD TO SIGN THE PLEDGE TO INVEST $50 BILLION BY 2013 TO COMBAT AIDS ACROSS THE WORLD. WE NEED TO LEAD THE WORLD. WE NEED TO LEAD THE WORLD IN STANDING UP FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS. 12 YEARS AGO, WHEN THE U.N. CONVENED A HISTORIC CONFERENCE ON WOMEN IN BEIJING, I WAS PROUD TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY AND PROCLAIM TO THE WORLD THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE WHEN WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE RAPED AS A CASUALTY OF CONFLICT, TRAFFICKED FOR COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE, DENIED EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE AND FAMILY PLANNING, NOT GIVEN ACCESS TO CREDIT, DENIED THEIR RIGHTS AS CITIZENS, THAT NOT ONLY AFFECTS THEM AND THEIR COUNTRY, THAT COMPROMISES THE DIGNITY AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN FAMILY. IF WE DON'T STAND FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS, WE WILL NEVER STAND FOR OUR BEST VALUES. THAT HAS TO BE A PART OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY. WE NEED TO LEAD THE WORLD IN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY TO THE WORLD'S CHILDREN, BECAUSE WHEN 100 MILLION CHILDREN IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD DON'T ATTEND SCHOOL AND 150 MILLION MORE DROP OUT BEFORE FINISHING FIRST GRADE, THAT IS A RECIPE FOR POVERTY, EXTREMISM, AND INSTABILITY. THAT'S WHY I'VE INTRODUCED THE BIPARTISAN EDUCATION FOR ALL ACT. $10 BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TOWARD THE GOAL OF BASIC EDUCATION FOR EVERY BOY AND GIRL AROUND THE WORLD. AND FINALLY, WE NEED TO LEAD THE WORLD BY LIVING UP TO OUR VALUES HERE AT HOME. AS WE SEEK TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IN OTHER NATIONS, WE MUST ACCEPT THIS FOR OURSELVES. AS WE COUNCIL LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, WE CANNOT SUPPORT TORTURE AND THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF PEOPLE WE'VE DECLARED TO BE BEYOND THE LAW. THE VALUES OUR FOUNDERS EMBRACED, VALUES THAT HAVE SHAPED THE ASPIRATIONS OF MILLIONS HERE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD, ARE OUR DEEPEST SOURCE OF STRENGTH. BUT ONLY IF WE LIVE UP TO THEM OURSELVES. NOW, I REALIZE THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS AGENDA. WOULD YOU EXPECT ANYTHING LESS FROM A WELLESLEY WOMAN? AND I KNOW I CAN'T DO IT ALONE. I NEED YOUR HELP. I AM THRILLED THAT WE ARE LAUNCHING 120 STUDENT CHAPTERS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA TODAY. WE HAVE A NEW WEBSITE CALLED HILLBLAZERS. THAT'S WWW.HILLBLAZERS.COM, TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE GET ORGANIZED. AND IN THE COMING WEEKS, I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THE CALLS AND KNOCK ON THE DOORS AND ORGANIZE THE EVENTS AND TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT I DID BACK IN 1968, WHEN A GROUP OF MY DEAR FRIENDS AND I JUMPED IN A CAR THAT ONE OF US IF HE NANGLED TO HAVE ON CAMPUS, AND WE WOULD DRIVE FROM WELLESLEY TO MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE, STUFFING ENVELOPES AND WALKING PRECINCTS FOR EUGENE McCARTHY. HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON A PLATFORM OF ENDING THE VIETNAM WAR. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN PART ON A PLATFORM TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ. AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, I NEED YOUR HELP ON ELECTION DAY. I NEED YOU TO GET THE VOTE OUT AND GET YOUR FRIENDS REGISTERED SO THEY CAN VOTE. IN 2004, WHILE THE VOTER TURNOUT RATE FOR 18 TO 34-YEAR-OLDS WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2000, MORE THAN 25 MILLION STILL NEVER CAST THEIR VOTE, ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY. FOR SO LONG, YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IGNORED AND SILENCED BY OTHERS. TODAY TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE SILENCE THEMSELVES. IT'S UP TO ALL OF YOU TO CHANGE THAT. I KNOW THAT POLITICS CAN BE FRUSTRATING, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE GET BOGGED DOWN IN DISTRACTIONS AND TRIVIALIZATIONS, WHO'S UP AND WHO'S DOWN, PEOPLE'S HAIR STYLE OR THEIR LAUGH OR WHAT THEY'RE WEARING, RATHER THAN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. BUT IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BREAK THROUGH THE NOISE, AND YOU JUST WANT TO GIVE UP, I URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE YOU. MANY OF THEM WE'LL NEVER KNOW THEIR NAMES, THEY'RE LOST TO HISTORY. BUT SO MANY OTHERS WE CAN READ THEIR STORIES, BE AMAZED AT THEIR STRENGTH AND THEIR COURAGE. THINK ABOUT THOSE AUDACIOUS WOMEN AND A FEW BRAVE MEN WHO GATHERED IN SENECA FALLS, NEW YORK, FOR THE DECLARATION TO ISSUE THE VERY FIRST STATEMENT EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD CALLING FOR WOMEN'S FULL EQUALITY. ELIZABETH KATIE STANTON, ONE OF THE KEY ORGANIZERS, WAS JUST 32 YEARS OLD. ONE ATTENDEE WAS JUST 15. IT TOOK MORE THAN 70 YEARS FOR THEM TO WIN THE VOTE, MORE THAN 70 YEARS OF PROTESTING, ORGANIZING, LOBBYING, GOING TO JAIL, DOING HUNGER STRIKES, CHANGE THEMSELVES TO THE GATE IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THEY NEVER GAVE UP. AND JUST ONE WOMAN FROM THE SENECA FALLS CONVENTION LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY CAST A BALLOT. THINK ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. WAS JUST 26 YEARS OLD WHEN HE LED THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT. MY DEAR FRIEND, CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS, WAS JUST 25 WHEN HE LED THAT HISTORIC MARCH ACROSS THE BRIDGE IN SELMA, A MARCH THAT ENDED WITH TEAR GAS, HOSES, AND THE CRACK OF NIGHT STICKS AGAINST HIS AND OTHERS' SKULLS, AS THE MAR CHERS KNELT DOWN TO PRAY. CHINK ABOUT THAT. THEY WERE ATTACKED AS THEY KNELT DOWN TO PRAY. THEY WERE, AS CONGRESSMAN LEWIS PUT IT LATER, ""USING OUR BODIES AS A WITNESS TO THE TRUTH."" AND THEY FORCED AMERICA TO BEAR WITNESS AS WELL. THEY WERE WILLING TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, AND TOGETHER THEY MADE THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE. I STAND HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THOSE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN, AND I AM INSPIRED EVERY DAY BY THE PEOPLE I MEET ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. YOU KNOW, THE MOTHERS AND FATHERS WHO LIFT THEIR LITTLE GIRLS ON THEIR SHOULDERS OR LEAN OVER AND WHISPER IN THEIR EARS, SEE, HONEY, IN AMERICA, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE. THE WOMEN IN THEIR 90s WHO COME TO MY EVENTS, THEY STAND THERE, THEY HOLD THEMSELVES UP IN A WALKER, THEY MAY BE IN A WHEELCHAIR, AND AS I MEET THEM, THEY TELL ME, I WAS BORN BEFORE WOMEN COULD VOTE AND I WANT TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE A WOMAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I KNOW THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE DAUNTING, BUT I STILL BELIEVE WHAT I SAID IN MY COMMENCEMENT SPEECH NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO -- FEAR IS ALWAYS WITH US, BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE TIME FOR IT, NOT NOW. SO LET'S ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK TOGETHER. WE'RE READY TO SHATTER THAT HIGHEST GLASS CEILING. IT'S WHAT AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS. IT'S WHAT I BELIEVE HAS CREATED THE SPACE FOR THE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF. I THINK WE'RE READY FOR THAT KIND OF CHANGE AGAIN. CHANGE IS JUST A WORD IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. I BELIEVE I DO, AND I BELIEVE TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE IT, WE CAN MAKE HISTORY. I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT WILL BE YOUNG PEOPLE DRIVEN BY DR. KING'S FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW WHO WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS ELECTION, BECAUSE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, MY PRESIDENCY IS ABOUT YOUR FUTURE, IT IS ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE YOUR LIVES, TO MAKE YOUR CHOICES HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE, TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELVES, THOSE WHOM YOU LOVE, YOUR COMMUNITIES, OUR COUNTRY, AND THE WORLD. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO, AND I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN DOING THAT WORK. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?201788-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"HILLARY CLINTON CELEBRATES HER 60th BIRTHDAY THIS WEEK. FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON THROUGH HER A BIRTHDAY PARTY AND FUND RAISER THAT INCLUDED PERFORMANCES BY ELVIS COSTELLO AND THE WALLFLOWER'S. FROM THE BEACON THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY THIS IS ABOUT 25 MINUTES. >> I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING, DO WHY? [LAUGHTER] JUST JUMP OUT OF THE BALCONY. JUST DO IT NOW. [LAUGHTER] I HAVE TO TELL YOU A TRUE STORY AND YOU DON'T INTERRUPT, YOU HAVE NO MORE LINES. [LAUGHTER] LAST WEEK I PERFORMED AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. IT WAS HOMECOMING AND I SAID TO THEM MOST OF THEM WERE 70 OR 18 YEARS OLD AWAY FROM HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAID YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY I FEEL BAD FOR YOU. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING ELSE BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU KNOW NOTHING ELSE OF THIS WAR, YOU KNOW NOTHING ELSE BUT THIS KIND OF WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN NOW SINCE YOU ARE 10 OR 11 YEARS OLD AND I SAID YOU DON'T KNOW THE OPTIMISM. OR HOW GREAT IT FEELS WHEN THERE IS A LEADER COMING WHO YOU TRUST. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND I SAID TO THEM YOU KNOW I DIDN'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE SOME OLD GUY FROM THE FIRE SAYING YOU DON'T REMEMBER ROOSEVELT. [LAUGHTER] IT WASN'T THAT. IT WAS THE SAME THREE TIMES IN MY LIFE AS SOMEONE WHO WAS POLITICALLY INTERESTED, THE FIRST TIME WAS WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD AND JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU WENT WELL WHAT A FANTASTIC MAN. CUTE KIDS, BEAUTIFUL WIFE, THIS GUY SPOKE TO US WHAT WIT AND HUMOR AND GRACE AND 46 YEARS LATER HIS POWER IS STILL UNDENIABLE. [APPLAUSE] THE SECOND TIME IS NOW. WITH A PROSPECT OF HILLARY BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND THE OTHER TIME, I HAVE TO SAY THE OTHER TIME WHEN I WAS REALLY OPTIMISTIC WHEN I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER WORLD WAS WHEN THIS MAN WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND IT WAS. [CHEERING] AND IT SO WHY IS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME BILL CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] (music)(music) (music)(music) IF I LOOK AWKWARD IT'S BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME TO STAND ON THE BLUE CARPET. SO THE LIGHTS WOULD BE OKAY. CHELSEA WANTED TO COME UP WITH ME TONIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT TO -- [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] -- INTRODUCE SOMEBODY TO GATHER. AND FIRST I HAVE A THING OR TWO TO SAY. BILLY CRYSTAL IS TERRIFIC. [APPLAUSE] AND HE WERE ALWAYS ASKING ME IF YOUR WIFE GETS ELECTED PRESIDENT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? AND I HAVEN'T KNOWN HOW TO ANSWER. I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT TONIGHT IN AT 14. I WANT TO CO-STAR WITH HIM IN A REMAX OF GRUMPY OLD MEN. [LAUGHTER] SERVICE BEFORE. THANK YOU, WE GAVE HIM MUSCLE RELAXER IS SO HE WOULDN'T REACH FOR THE TOP TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE. AND EARLIER WE WILL INTRODUCE THE NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL WHO WAS NOT HERE BECAUSE THEY WERE WORKING BUT THEY HAVE ALL, AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THEM TO STAND UP AND BE RECOGNIZED. TURN THE LIGHTS UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANTONAKES, CHARLIE. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE RUSS FEINGOLD BECAUSE -- [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] -- I AM DEEPLY INDEBTED FOR HIM FOR TWO THINGS FIRSTLY CALLED HIM MONDAY FROM FLORIDA AND ASKED IF HE WOULD GET AN OFFICE IN HARLEM AND THE NEXT DAY I HAD AN OFFICE. IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, LITERALLY WITHIN HOURS OF SENATOR MOYNIHAN ANNOUNCING HIS RETIREMENT, THE FIRST NEW YORKER TO CALL HILLARY AND URGED HER TO RUN FOR THE SENATE WAS CHARLES LAMB GOLD. WE TOLD HIM OF THIS DAY AND ARE GRATEFUL TO HIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK THE WALLFLOWER'S ARE THEY GREAT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND MY GOOD FRIEND ELVIS COSTELLO ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLLERS IN THE HISTORY OF POP FILM MUSIC. [APPLAUSE] I IDENTIFY WITH ELVIS COSTELLO BECAUSE HE'S IN THE SAME BUSINESS AS HIS WIFE. [LAUGHTER] AND THEY DID JUST HAVE TWINS AND WE WISH ELVIS AND DIANA WELL WITH THEIR YOUNG BOYS AND I'M GLAD THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A BIRTHDAY PARTY. TERRY GIVE THE POLITICAL ARGUMENT FOR HILDRETH. I TELL EVERYBODY THAT EVEN THOUGH TWO WEEKS AGO TODAY, WE CELEBRATED OUR 32nd ANNIVERSARY. [APPLAUSE] I WOULD BE CAMPAIGNING FOR HER IF SHE ASKED IF WE WERE NOT MARRIED BECAUSE I STRONGLY FEEL THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MARGIN FOR ERROR AND EVEN THOUGH I LIKE ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE SHE HAS A GOOD LONG STRETCH IS THE BEST QUALIFIED PERSON, SHE'S NOT AN INCUMBENT. [APPLAUSE] BUT IN BRINGING HER UP I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TONIGHT. ABOUT HER LIFE. BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN IT NOW FOR MORE AND HALF OF HER LIFE. SHE WAS JUST 23 WHEN WE MET. THE POOR CHILD DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN TO TALK TO ME. [LAUGHTER] AND I WAS THINKING OF THE NIGHT ABOUT HOW WE CELEBRATED HER 24th BIRTHDAY WHEN SHE WAS IN LAW SCHOOL AND ALL OF THE ONES WE HAVE CELEBRATED SINCE. HER MOTHER IS HERE WHO JUST WENT TO A SEVEN NDS HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. DOROTHY, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HER BROTHER TONY AND SISTER IN LONEGAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU JOHN AND YOUR LOYALTY AND FOR PRODUCING THIS GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. [APPLAUSE] BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. I HAVE KNOWN HER IN MOST OF THE DECADE OF HER LIFE. AND I HAVE FILLED IN THE BLANKS FROM BEFORE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT HER BREAST FRIEND AND CHILD IS STILL A CASES TO HER. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE SHE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL WITH A LOT OF THEM ARE OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR HER. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN SHE GOT HOME FROM IOWA TO PRACTICALLY HAD TEARS IN HER EYES BECAUSE 75 PEOPLE FROM ARKANSAS SHOWED UP FROM IOWA HAVEN'T MADE THEIR OWN BROCHURES WITH PICTURES FROM HER FROM THE 1980'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT SHE HAD BEEN MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE SHE HAD WORKED. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE HAPPIEST TIMES FOR ME IN THIS WAS WHEN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK COMPANY AND TELL ME ABOUT SOMETHING THEY DID WITH THEM THAT WAS PURELY HUMAN. WHEN THE HAD A CHILD WHO WAS ILL AND NO HEALTH CARE, WHEN THEY NEEDED HELP AND NO ONE ELSE WOULD HELP. IT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME. SHE IS AND THIS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. TONIGHT WHEN I SAW ELVIS COSTELLO APPEAR WITH THE WALLFLOWER'S PLAYED TOGETHER WITH HIM SOME YOUNG JACOB DYLAN I THOUGHT TWO MYSELF THAT LAST NIGHT ELVIS COSTELLO WAS PERFORMING ON A DIFFERENT STAGE WITH HIS FATHER, BOB DYLAN. AND TO COME HERE AND SEE THEM TOGETHER IS SORT OF A METAPHOR FOR NEGATIVE THREE AND HER 60 IF YOU'RE STILL LOOKING I THINK A VERY BEAUTIFUL. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] IS MAKING THIS CAMPAIGN. NOT SO MUCH FOR THE OVER ROCKERS BUT FOR THE NEW ONES. NOT SO MUCH FOR TODAY, BUT FOR TOMORROW. SHE'S HAD A RICH, FULL, TEXTURED, WONDERFUL, AMAZING LIFE. BLESSED BEYOND A MEASURE OF FRIENDS, AND BY FRIENDS LIKE YOU WHO CARED ENOUGH TO COME HERE TONIGHT TO SUPPORT HER. [APPLAUSE] SHE HAS KEPT HER FRIENDS OF A LIFETIME, AND NEVER STOPPED THINKING ABOUT THOSE YET TO COME. IT IS BECAUSE OF HER PERSONAL QUALITIES THAT I THINK WE SHOULD CELEBRATE 64 WONDERFUL YEARS AND BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE WANTS TO GIVE AND THOSE KINDS OF YEARS, EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVERY CHILD IN THE WORLD WHO WE CAN REACH, WE LOVE YOU AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. , PURE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THANK YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] HEY, COME HERE. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS EVENING. YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT BILL SAID BECAUSE I FEEL VERY BLESSED ESPECIALLY TONIGHT TO BE HERE WITH MY FAMILY NOT ONLY TELL SEA AND BILL BUT MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER-IN-LAW AND ALL OF YOU WHO I CONSIDER KIND OF A BIG EXTENDED FAMILY. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR NOT JUST THIS EVENING BUT FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE IN MY CANDIDACY. AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY, I AM ALWAYS SO PROUD WHEN MY KID TO TALK ABOUT NEW YORK AND NEW YORKERS AND WHAT NEW YORK AND NEW YORKERS MEAN TO ME. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE TO THANK FOR THIS EVENING. AND OF COURSE I WANT TO THANK TERRY MCAULIFFE AND MY ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. DON'T WE HAVE A GREAT CAMPAIGN FOR THE PEOPLE WORKING SO HARD EVERY SINGLE DE? [APPLAUSE] AND OF COURSE, HERE IN NEW YORK DENNIS CHANG HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY GREAT THREE [APPLAUSE] AND THE ENTIRE FINANCE TEAM FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO MADE THIS HAPPEN AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAVELED FROM SO MANY PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND WE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT MY FRIEND AS MANY, MANY YEARS, SOMEONE WHOM I JUST LOVE, JOHN SYKES WHO HAS MADE THIS HAPPEN AS HE HAS SO MANY OTHER THINGS AND THE TEAM THAT HE HAS PUT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] AND, YOU KNOW, BILLY CRYSTAL JUST MAKES ME SMILE. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS WALK OUT AND START TO LAUGH. AND HE HAS BEEN NOT JUST A MUSING US AND MAKING US FEEL GOOD, BUT MAKING US THINK FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING HE SAID TONIGHT ABOUT THE YANKEES BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A FAN, AND I REMAIN A FAN OF THE NEW YORK YANKEES. NO CHANGES, NO LOOKING TO CURRY FAVOR OR IF ANYBODY ELSE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE EXTRAORDINARY MUSICAL TALENT THAT WE HAVE HERE THIS EVENING. IT WAS VERY TOUCHING TO ME TO HAVE THE WALLFLOWERS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEIR MUSIC I HEARD ALL THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE AND WHEN CHELSEA AND HER FRIENDS OR AT HOME, AND EVEN TODAY, AND IT WAS FOR ME A WONDERFUL BRIDGE BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT IT WAS A TALENTED GROUP THAT WAS MAKING IT ON ITS OWN BUT THE FACT THAT JACOB DYLAN WAS FOR MANY OF US A CONNECTION TO HIS EXTRAORDINARY FATHER, BOB DYLAN, MADE IT EVEN SWEETER TO SEE THIS YOUNG MAN AND BEAST THREE EXTRAORDINARY MUSICIANS MAKING IT AND DOING IT AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE WALLFLOWERS FOR BEING PART OF TONIGHT. AND ELVIS COSTELLO IS RANKED AMONG THE VERY VERY BEST THAT HAVE EVER BEEN IN ROCK-AND-ROLL AND YOU CAN SEE WHY TONIGHT. THOSE OF US WHO JUST ARE AMAZED AT HIM AND WHAT HE DID ON THIS STAGE AS HE HAS DONE ON COUNTLESS STAGES AND HIS EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY IN PRESENTING HIS CRAFT. IT WAS JUST A PLEASURE TO SEE HIM AND AS BILL SAID, HE IS SOMEONE WHO WE BOTH ADMIRE AND ARE SO HAPPY THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS OF OURS. SO IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A BETTER NIGHT FOR MUSICAL TALENT AND THIS FABLED YET HER. THE BEACON HAS BEEN A BEACON FOR MUSIC AND PARTICULARLY ROCK-AND-ROLL FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND IT'S GREAT THAT THEY HAVE OPENED THIS OUT TO US THIS EVENING. YOU KNOW, THIS CAMPAIGN IS REALLY ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. IT WASN'T SO LONG AGO AS BILLY WAS SUGGESTING WHEN WE WERE DOING BETTER, WHEN WE HAD THE KIND OF POLICIES THAT WE ARE BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE, AND THIS ONE IS NO DIFFERENT. AND AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY I SENSE THE INTENSITY FROM PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE SO READY TO GET BACK TO DOING WHAT AMERICANS DO BETTER THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD. ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES, SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS, MEETING OUR CHALLENGES, AND I HAVE SET FOR BIG GOALS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT DURING THIS CAMPAIGN AND THAT I HOPE TO ACHIEVE AS YOUR PRESIDENT. WE ARE GOING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD AND DO IT BY WORKING TO FIND COMMON GROUND WHEREVER WE CAN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND OF COURSE, IT BEGINS BY ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS CAREFULLY AND RESPONSIBLY AND QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. [APPLAUSE] BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES. PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICIES HAVE ALIENATED OUR FRIENDS AND EMBOLDENED OUR ENEMIES. A AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF REPAIR WORK TO DO, BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC THAT WE ARE UP TO IT AND WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER. AND HERE AT HOME WE ARE GOING TO SET A GOAL OF REBUILDING A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS SO THAT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A SHOT AT THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. AND, YOU KNOW, AS I TRAVEL AROUND SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY ARE INVISIBLE. YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE, THE CAN'T AFFORD COLLEGE EDUCATION. THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS UNDER LEADERS LIKE CHARLIE WRANGLED ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE A REAL CHANGE. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT ON THE OTHER END OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WHO SEES THE PROBLEMS, WHO HEARS THE CONCERNS THAT WE DO. SO WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN TO RECONSTRUCT WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF POSITIVE, POSSIBILITY AGAIN THREE WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT ENERGY TO CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS TO IMPROVE OUR SECURITY AND TO DEAL WITH GLOBAL WARMING. WE CAN DO THIS. THE FUND BEFORE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN APOLLO LIKE PROJECT. WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE HEALTH CARE AGAIN BECAUSE WE WANT QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN AND WE ARE GOING TO GO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT STARTS WITH UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN AND MAKES COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND ALSO GIVES MORE APPRENTICESHIPS AND JOB TRAINING TO HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WHO WANT A COMPETITIVE JOB IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND WE ARE GOING TO END PRESIDENT BUSH'S WAR ON SCIENCE. WE ARE GOING TO START MUZZLING OUR SCIENTISTS TO DO RESEARCH AND AIM FOR THE FUTURE AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND OF COURSE, IN ORDER TO DO THIS, WE HAVE TO REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT, ENDING THE CRONYISM AND NO BID CONTRACTS, AND WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO THIS OLD FASHIONED IDEA HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE POSITIONS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN OUR GOVERNMENT AGAIN? [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND FINALLY, WE ARE GOING TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE. RECLAIM OF THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR COUNTRY. I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. I MEAN, EVERY GENERATION HAS STEPPED UP TO DO IT. AND AS I THINK ABOUT IT, WE DO NOT WANT TO BE, AND WE WILL NOT BE THE FIRST GENERATION OF AMERICANS THAT LEAVE OUR COUNTRY WORSE OFF THAN WHEN WE FOUND IT. WE ARE GOING TO BE COMMITTED TO THE KIND OF FUTURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY DESERVES TO HAVE. AND FOR ME, IT'S A GREAT HONOR AND AN EXTRAORDINARILY HUMBLING EXPERIENCE TO THINK THAT I COULD BE THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] BUT YOU KNOW, I AM NOT RUNNING BECAUSE I'M A ONE. HI I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I THINK OF THE BEST QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED PERSON TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING IN JANUARY, 2009. TO MAKE THESE CHANGES THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO OUR COUNTRY. I COULD NOT DO THIS IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY FAMILY. YOU KNOW? EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE BILL PROBABLY HOUSE FOR GOTTEN MORE ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS THAN ALL OF US PUT TOGETHER WILL EVER KNOW. HE HAS BEEN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT HER AND PARTNER IN THIS VENTURE THAT I'M ON, AND I DO A LOT OF WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE INSPIRATION AND SUPPORT I GET FROM MY DAUGHTER, WHO I AM SO PROUD OF AND SO GRATEFUL TO. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND WHEN I GO OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE, TO CORRUPT, NEVADA, WHICH IS AN HOUR OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS IN THE DESERT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP, I AM SO TOUCHED BY THE PEOPLE WHO COME OUT TO SEE ME, BUT THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT PARTICULARLY MOVE ME. ONE ARE WOMEN IN THEIR VERY LATE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHO COME OUT. THEY STAND SOMETIMES FOR HOURS, SOME ARE IN WALKERS OR WHEELCHAIR'S, SOME ARE STANDING STRAIGHT UP. AND WHEN I MEET THEM THEY PUT OUT THEIR HANDS AND THEY SAY I'M 95 YEARS OLD. I WAS BORN BEFORE WOMEN COULD VOTE. AND I WANT TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE A WOMAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND THE OTHER OUR PARENTS WHO BRING THEIR CHILDREN. AND I OFTEN HEAR AS I GROWTH THROUGH A CROWD OF MOTHER OR FATHER LEAD OVER AND WHISPERED INTO A DR'S ER SI, HONEY, IN THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE. AND I KNOW I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS BECAUSE MY MOTHER USED TO TELL ME THAT AND I WANT EVERY CHILD, EVERY SON AND DAUGHTER TO BELIEVE THAT. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE THAT TRUE. WE CAN'T LET THE NEXT GENERATION DOWN. AND FOR ME, ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT ONLY BELIEVE THINK THAT OUR CHILDREN CAN BE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO BE. BUT THAT OUR COUNTRY CAN BE EVERYTHING IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS A GOOD AND GREAT COUNTRY. LET'S GO OUT AND CHANGE IT AND MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] (music)(music) IT'S BEEN A GREAT NIGHT. IT WOULDN'T BE YOUR BIRTHDAY WITHOUT THE THRILL OF HAVING ALL THIS COSTELLO AND THE WALLFLOWERS'. LET'S JOIN TOGETHER AND SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. (music) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU (music) (music) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU (music) HAPPY BIRTHDAY MRS.

NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL HOLD ITS PRIMARY FIVE DAYS AFTER THE IOWA CAUCUSES ON TUESDAY, JANUARY 8. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW WHO THE MOST HEROIC PEOPLE ARE HERE TONIGHT? IT IS NOT GUYS LIKE ME TO GIVE THESE TALKS. IT IS THE INCREDIBLE WEIGHT STAFF AT THE COUNTRY CLUB WHO HAS HAD A TOUGH JOB GETTING THROUGH. I THINK YOU OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A HAND. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THEM MANEUVER THESE HAVE EACH RAISED THROUGH A VERY CLARK -- A VERY CROWDED ROOM AND ALL I CAN DO IS ADMIRE THE AGILITY WITH WHICH THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT THEIR TASK. IF CONGRESS WAS AS EFFICIENT AS THE WAIT STAFF HERE AT THE KING CAN -- BECAME COUNTRY CLUB, WE WOULD NOT HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS IN AMERICA TODAY. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO THEM. [APPLAUSE] I TRIED TO MAKE SURE I WAS NOT IN THEIR WAY. THE ONLY THING THAT IS PROBABLY WORSE THAN MAKING A SPEECH AT A DINNER, IS GETTING BETWEEN SOME PERSON AND THEIR DINNER. I REALIZE I WAS ABOUT TO DO THAT IN SOME CASES TONIGHT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED WAS THAT -- MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I ALWAYS GET THE FACE QUESTIONS IN THE DEBATES. HAVING -- THE FAITH QUESTIONS IN THE DEBATE. I HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT IF JESUS HAD EVER SPOKEN AT ONE OF THESE POLITICAL BANQUETS, THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER BEATITUDE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ""BLESSED ARE THE BRIEF, FOR THEY SHALL BE INVITED AGAIN."" [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I AM AWARE THAT MOST OF YOU CAME FOR THE PRIME RIB AND NOT FOR THE PRIME CANDIDATE. I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS MANY PEOPLE PACKED IN HERE. I COME FROM A STATE WHERE THERE ARE NOT MANY REPUBLICANS. WHEN I SEE THIS MANY EVER, I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED. I GREW UP IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF HOPE, ARKANSAS. BY THE WAY, I REALLY GROWN UP -- I REALLY GREW UP THERE. THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN ASKED ME IF I REALLY WAS FROM WHOLE. IT WAS THE OTHER GUY THAT WAS -- I REALLY WAS FROM HOBE. IT WAS THE OTHER GUY THAT WAS THE IMPOSTER. I GREW UP IN HOPES AND SOMETIMES THAT CREATES SOME PROBLEMS. THERE WAS A GUY ON AN AIRPLANE NEXT TO ME WHO SAYS, MR., I HAVE A JOKE I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A POLITICIAN FROM HOPE, ARKANSAS. I SAID, BEFORE YOU AND VEHRS YOURSELF, I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW -- EMBARRASS YOURSELF, I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I AM A POLITICIAN FROM HOPE, ARKANSAS. HE SAID, THAT IS ALL RIGHT, I WILL TELL IT REALLY SLOW. [LAUGHTER] I AM USED TO HAVING TO EXPLAIN THE WHOLE DEAL ABOUT THE FACT THAT I AM FROM THERE, BUT THAT IS WHERE THE SIMILARITIES END. GROWING UP THERE, THERE WERE NO REPUBLICANS NATIVE TO HOPE. I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP. THEY USED TO HAVE A SAYING IN HEMPSTEAD COUNTY THAT THE ONLY REPUBLICANS WERE THE ONES THAT EITHER MOVED IN FROM SOMEWHERE OR HAD BEEN MESSED WITH. [LAUGHTER] IT WAS THE KIND OF DEAL WHERE I THINK THERE WERE SEVEN REPUBLICANS IN HEMPSTEAD COUNTY. IT IS ALWAYS EASY TO DO THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. THEY ALWAYS JUST RENTED A BOOTH AT THE LOCAL WAFFLE HOUSE AND CHECK THE VOTES AND THAT WAS THE END OF THAT. I BECAME A REPUBLICAN AS A TEENAGER. IT WAS THE INFLUENCE OF A BOOK OPEN CODE IT WAS A CHOICE, NOT AN ECHO."" -- IT WAS THE INFLUENCE OF THE BOOK ""IT IS A CHOICE, NOT AN ECHO."" I REALIZED THAT WHAT THE AUTHOR ESPOUSED IN HIS REPUBLICAN PHILOSOPHY WAS WHAT I BELIEVED. THAT IS, WE NEED A NATION WHOSE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GET IN OUR WAY. BASICALLY, THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNMENT IS THAT IT IS CONFIDENT, BUT LIMITED. THE TAXES ARE BETTER WHEN THEY ARE LOW AND NOT HIDE. GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONTROL SPENDING, NOT SEE HOW MUCH THEY CAN DO. MOTHERS AND FATHERS RAISED THEIR KIDS THAN GOVERNMENTS DO, SO LEAVE THE FAMILY ALONE AND LET THEM RAISE THEIR KIDS. [APPLAUSE] THE BEST GOVERNMENT IS THE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT IS CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY BEING GOVERNED. HE ALSO TAUGHT ME THE PUBLIC SERVICE, GIVING SOMETHING BACK IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF BEING AN AMERICAN. I AM DISTURBED THAT FROM EVEN THOSE TEENAGE YEARS. I ALSO -- I UNDERSTOOD THAT FROM EVEN THOSE TEENAGE YEARS. I HAD INCREDIBLE PARENTS TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR ME. LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND I WANT TO SEE IT BECOME THE BEST IT COULD INDEED. AND REFUSED TO EXCEPT THE IDEA THAT THE GREATEST GENERATION IS THE GENERATION THAT HAS ALREADY LIVES AND IS DYING OFF. I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE GREATEST GENERATION IN AMERICA HAS NOT EVEN BEEN BORN YET. BUT IF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, WE HAVE TO DO SOME HEAVY LIFTING TO PREPARE. I THINK ABOUT THE SACRIFICES THAT PEOPLE MADE IN MY PARENTS' GENERATION FOR MAY, A PARTICULARLY MY OWN PARENTS. MY FATHER WORKED ... IN MY PARENTS' GENERATION FOR ME, PARTICULARLY MY OWN PARENTS. MY FATHER WORKED REBUILDING OUR GENERATORS, AND MY DAD WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS TO THAT WORKED WITH HIS HANDS. HE NEVER GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND NOBODY UPSTREAM FROM ME AS A MALE EVER GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO DO IT. I AM ONE NEXT-GENERATION AWAY FROM DIRT FLOORS AND ARE DARK TOILET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY FAMILY. IF MY PARENTS HAD TO -- AND OUTDOOR TOILETS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY FAMILY. TIVIOLI SOAP WE HAD AT MY HOUSE WAS CAUSSEAUX. THAT HOT -- THE ONLY SOAP WE HAD AT MY HOUSE WAS A LOT OF SOAP. I WAS IN COLLEGE BEFORE I FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HURT WHEN YOU TOOK A SHOWER. [LAUGHTER] I SEE TODAY THESE ADVERTISEMENTS FOR AND EXPLOITATION. I HAVE GOT NEWS FOR YOU, 50 CENTS AND A BAR OF LAVA WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. [LAUGHTER] AS A KID, I REALIZED WHAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY I HAD BECAUSE I LIVED IN THIS COUNTRY. ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES ABOUT OUR PARTY IS THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE POWER OF THE INDIVIDUAL. WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CHOICE ABOUT WHERE WE START AND HOW THINGS BEGIN FOR US, AND WE HAVE ALL -- -- WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CHOICE ABOUT WHERE WE START AND HOW THINGS BEGIN FOURTH, WE HAVE ALL THE TOYS IN THE WORLD ABOUT WHERE THINGS AND UP. IT IS OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, EMPOWERMENT, AND WILL TO WORK THAT MAKES US WHAT WE WANT TO BE. I BELIEVE THAT AS OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WROTE THOSE INCREDIBLE WORDS THAT ALL OF US ARE CREATED EQUAL WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS AND AMONG THESE, LIFE, LIBERTY AND PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS -- THEY GOT IT RIGHT. WHEN THEY PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE DOCUMENT AND THEY BROKE WITH THEIR MOTHER COUNTRY, THERE WERE NOT JUST SIGNING A DOCUMENT THAT PUT THEM ON IT OUT SO THAT IF THINGS DID NOT WORK REALLY WELL, THEY WOULD LOSE SOME BUSINESS. IT WAS NOT THAT THEIR INCOMES WOULD IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN THEY PUT THEIR SIGNATURES ON THAT DOCUMENT AND AFFIXED THEIR NAMES FOR EVERYONE TO SEE, THAT IF THAT REVOLUTION THAT THEY STARTED DID NOT WORK, EVERYONE WOULD PLAY -- EVERY ONE OF THEM WOULD PAY WITH THEIR LIVES. THEY WERE PUTTING SOMETHING ON THE LINE THAT HAS ALWAYS GIVEN US THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, AND THAT IS, THE GREATEST SACRIFICE OF THE NEXT GENERATION COULD BE FREE. EVERY STEP OF OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MARKED BY THOSE WHO HAVE PUT SOMETHING OUT THERE FOR OTHERS AT THE RISK TO THEMSELVES. MANY OF US ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE HAD PARENTS WHO SACRIFICED FOR US. I AM JUST LEARNING EVERY YEAR SOMETHING NEW ABOUT WHAT MY OWN PARENTS SACRIFICED SO THAT I WOULD HAVE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEM -- A BETTER LIFE THAN THEM. I WOULD SAY THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND THE KIND OF LIES THEY LIVE, GOING THROUGH THE DEPRESSION -- AND BY THE WAY, I FEEL LIKE I SOMETIMES WENT THROUGH BECAUSE I HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT THEY MADE THOSE SACRIFICES SO THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT. THEY GAVE ME AN EDUCATION, SOMETHING THAT THEY DID NOT GET TO ENJOY, BUT I CAN LIVE BETTER THAN THEM. I HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS IS WHY YOU ARE INVOLVED IN POLITICS. IT CERTAINLY IS NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON POLITICAL THINGS OR YOU ENJOY GOING TO BANQUETS AND DINNERS AND PUBLIC EVENTS. IT IS BECAUSE SOMEHOW DEEP INSIDE OF YOU, YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNTRY IS WORTH THE STANDING UP FOR AND MAKING SOME SACRIFICES FOR AND YOU PROBABLY FEEL AN OBLIGATION, AS I DO, THAT TO WHOM MUCH HAS BEEN GIVEN, MUCH IS REQUIRED. TRULY, MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN OUR PARTY THAT ARE VERY DOWN IN THE MOUTH ABOUT OUR FUTURE. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAD A TOUGH YEAR IN THE ELECTIONS LAST YEAR, BUT I DO NOT JOIN THE BLUEBIRD OF THE MONTH COKE -- CLUB AND IF THINK THAT OUR PARTY HAS SEEN ITS LAST DAYS. I THINK WE NEED TO ONCE AGAIN REMIND AMERICA WHAT WE STAND FOR. WHEN WE DO THAT, WE'LL BECOME THE MAJORITY PARTY ONCE AGAIN. AND WE WILL KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE. THE REASON THAT IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF AMERICA IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS ELECTED PRESIDENT. THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE NOBODY THAT IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT KNOWS HILLARY CLINTON BETTER THAN I DO. IN FACT, NOBODY ELSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS EVER RUN AGAINST THE BILL AND HILLARY POLITICAL MACHINE AND I HAVE. I ACTUALLY BEAT IT FOUR TIMES AND I CAN TELL YOU, IT IS ONE FORMIDABLE HEADWIND TO WORK AGAINST. TO BE THE ONLY -- TO BE ONLY THE FOURTH REPUBLICAN TO BE ELECTED IN MY STATE IN 150 YEARS, THE HEAD WINDS WERE, INDEED, STRONG. I THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE WOULD FACE IF SHE WERE ELECTED, IF WE WERE SOMEHOW JUST TO RESIGN OURSELVES THAT WE CANNOT DO BETTER. BUT WE CAN DO BETTER. AND THE NEXT YEAR, WITH A LOT OF HARD WORK FROM REPUBLICANS ACROSS THIS LAND, WE WILL DO BETTER. YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS WENT -- AND MADE A MISTAKE WHEN THEY WENT TO CONGRESS AND IS THAT IT WOULD SPEND LESS MONEY AND NOT MORE. WE SENT THEM UP THERE TO FIX THE BORDER SITUATION AND NOT JUST PUSH THE PROBLEM DOWN ON THE STATES SO THAT GOVERNORS LIKE ME WERE FORCED TO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT. WE SENT THEM OF THEIR TO DO WITH THE HEALTH CARE SITUATION AND INSTEAD, THEY HAD NO ANSWERS AND CAME INTO GRIDLOCK. WE SENT THEM UP THERE TO MAKE US ENERGY INDEPENDENCE ABOUT ONE DAY WE COULD TELL THE SAUDIS THAT WE DID NOT NEED THEIR OIL ANYMORE THAN -- SO THAT WE COULD PUT ONE DAY TELL THESE BODIES TELL THE SAUDIS THAT WE DO NOT NEED THEIR OIL AND MORE THAN WE NEED THEIR SAND. [APPLAUSE] WE DID NOT SEND THEM THERE SO THAT WE COULD NOW BE IN A QUANDARY ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH IRAN. IF WE HAD DONE WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, THE IRANIANS WOULD NOT BE BUILDING A NUCLEAR REACTOR BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO IT. THEY CANNOT SELL ENOUGH RUGS TO BUILD A NUCLEAR REACTOR, IF THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE REDUCED TO. [APPLAUSE] IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE START OFF OF BUILDING A STRONG COUNTRY AND THAT MEANS A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE. -- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE -- RONALD REAGAN HAD IT RIGHT AND WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT ONCE AGAIN. I WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND IN MY FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE, I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK AT A DINNER LIKE THIS UP IN ARKANSAS. I GOT THERE AND REALIZED THAT IT WAS A BUFFET, WHICH MEANT THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE COMING OR GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LINE AND PICK UP THEIR PLATES AND THEN GO AND BE SEATED. A REASONABLY INTELLIGENT POLITICIAN WHO FIGURES THE STUFF OUT -- I KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE PICKING UP THEIR PLATES AND I STOOD THERE SO THAT I COULD SHAKE THEIR HAND AND SAY HELLO TO THEM. I WAITED UNTIL EVERYONE HAD ON THEIR PLATES AND BEEN SERVE THEIR FOOD AND GONE TO BE SEATED IN THE BAICHWAL. I LOOKED AROUND AND NO ONE ELSE WAS COMING, SO I PICKED UP A PLAY TO GET MY TRUDE. AT THE TIME, THE YOUNG MAN WORKING AT THE BUFFET LINE SAID, EXCUSE ME, DO YOU HAVE A TICKET? [LAUGHTER] I SAID, ACTUALLY, I DO NOT. I AM THE SPEAKER TONIGHT AND THEY DID NOT EXPECTING TO HAVE TO HAVE A TICKET SINCE I AM GETTING THE TOP. HE SAID, I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT, BUT I AM NOT TO GIVE ANYONE A PLATE UNLESS THEY HAVE A TICKET. I SAID, I'M MIKE HUCKABEE, YOU'RE THE TENET GOVERNMENT ORDAZ -- GOV.. HE SAID, IT IS AN -- YOUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. HE SAID, IT IS AN HONOR TO MEET YOU, BUT YOU ARE NOT GETTING A PLATE WITHOUT A TICKET. [LAUGHTER] SO I WENT TO THE HEAD TABLE AND SAT DOWN NEXT TO THE LOCAL REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIR. HE SAID, MIKE, WERE YOU NOT HUNGRY? [LAUGHTER] I SAID, I WAS, BUT THE YOUNG MAN BACK THERE IN THE KITCHEN TOLD ME THAT IF I DID NOT HAVE A TICKET AND, I COULD NOT HAVE A PLATE AND YOU DID NOT SEND ME A TICKET. HE WAS HORRIFIED. HE JUMPED OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND I GRABBED HIM AND PULLED HIM BACK DOWN. I SAID, I WANT YOU TO SIT DOWN AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GO BACK THERE AND SAY THINGS TO THAT YOUNG MAN. HE SAID, WHY? AND I SAID, THAT IS THE PERSON MAJOR CURRENCY AND A LONG TIME WHO DID EXACTLY WHAT SOMEBODY TOLD HIM -- THAT IS THE FIRST TEENAGER IN A LONG TIME THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SOMEBODY TOLD HIM TO DO. YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE. [LAUGHTER] IF CONGRESS HAD SENT -- IF CONGRESS HAD DONE WHAT WE SENT THEM TO DO, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT DISAPPEAR. WE DID NOT WIN THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE --WE FORGOT WHAT OUR PRINCIPLES ARE. WE WILL WIN WHEN WE ONCE AGAIN COMMUNICATE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT OUR PURPOSE IN RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS NOT JUST TO GET THERE. IT IS TO GET THE JOB DONE WITH CONFIDENCE ONCE WE ARE THERE. IT IS TO CHANGE THE TAX SYSTEM AND OUR TAX SYSTEM NEEDS A TOTAL OVERHAUL, NOT A TWIST OF THE SCREEN DOOR AND A TAP OF THE HAMMER. I PERSONALLY THINK THE THE BIG PROBLEMS OF OUR TAX SITUATION IS PART OF THE REASON 10 TRILLION DOLLARS OF U.S. MONEY SIT OFFSHORE. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT MANY BUSINESSES NEVER MAKE IT PAST THE KITCHEN TABLE TO START THE LAUNCH OF A SMALL BUSINESS BECAUSE COMPLYING WITH THE TAX CODE IS FAR GREATER THAN THE CHALLENGE OF THEIR COMPETITORS, OR OVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES OF STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE HAD A TAX CODE SO SIMPLE THAT A 7- YEAR-OLD RUNNING A LEMONADE STAND WITH ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT INSTEAD OF THE 77,000 PAGE TAX CODE THAT IS TALLER THAN I AM? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE HAD A TAX CODE THAT DID NOT PENALIZE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ANYBODY THAT MADE MONEY? THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE A CORPORATE OR INDIVIDUAL INCOME- TAX OR A CAPITAL GAINS TAX AT ALL? AND IT DID NOT HAVE TAX ON SAVINGS OR A TAX ON DEATHS. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN -- MOST AMERICANS ARE MORE AFRAID OF A TAX AUDIT BY THE IRS THEN THEY ARE OF GETTING MUGGED. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK, WELL, THAT IS JUST IRRATIONAL. NOT REALLY. WHEN YOU GET MUGGED, I'D ONLY LASTS A FEW SECONDS AND THEY CAN ONLY GET WHAT YOU GOT. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU GET AUDITED BY THE IRS, IT WILL TAKE MONTHS AND THEY WILL NOT LEAVE YOU ALONE UNTIL THEY HAVE EVERY LAST PENNY. THE BEST MODEL OF THE TAX CODE IS THE ONE DESIGNED BY THE ECONOMIST FROM MIT, BOSTON AND OTHERS. IT ELIMINATES THE IRS. APRIL 14 WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT THAN A -- APRIL 15 WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT THAN APRIL 14. JUST ANOTHER SPRING DAY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IN ADDITION TO GETTING RID OF THE IRS, WHAT IF YOU GOT YOUR ENTIRE PAYCHECK EVERY TIME YOU EARNED IT? AND THE TAX SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY WAS COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT? I KNOW PEOPLE THAT SAY, DO YOU THINK WE COULD REALLY PASS THAT? IF I JUST TURNED IT OVER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS, PROBABLY NOT. THEY LIKE THE FACT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF LOBBYISTS. BUT I HAVE NOT TALKED TO MANY AMERICANS WHO DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA. THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST JOB AS COMMANDER -- IS COMMANDER AND CHIEF AND THE SECOND JOB IS A COMMUNICATOR IN CHIEF. THAT MEANS HE SELLS IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEY IN TURN GO TO THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND SAY, GET US A NEW TAX SYSTEM OR WE WILL GET A NEW CONGRESSMAN WHO WILL. IT IS AMAZING HOW WELL THEY GET THAT MESSAGE. WE CAN TRENT -- TRANSFORM THIS TAX CODE AND THE SYSTEM. WHEN WE DO THAT, IMAGINE JOBS COMING BACK TO THIS COUNTRY RATHER THAN DISAPPEARING. NOT HAVING TO LOOK AT SOME FATHER ON THE STATE -- IN THE FACE ON FRIDAY WHO HAS TO GO HOME AND TELL HIS FAMILY THAT HE NO LONGER HAS A PAYCHECK OR EIGHT HENCHEN. HE IS NOT SURE HOW -- OR A PENSION. HE IS NOT SURE HOW HE IS GOING TO PAY HIS RENT THE NEXT MONTH. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WHO CAN ADDRESS THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES, WHETHER HE IS A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, IS GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION. HE IS ALSO GOING TO TRANSFORM AMERICA. I WANT THE REPUBLICANS TO BE THE ONES WHO CHANGE EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE AND TO STAND UP FOR A NEW TAX CODE AND A NEW TYPE -- A NEW KIND OF ECONOMY WHERE EVERYBODY LIVES -- EVERYBODY WINS BY AND NOBODY LOSES BY. IF I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT TO ACTUALLY MAKES IT SO SAVE IN THIS COUNTRY -- I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT WHO MAKES IT SO SAFE IN THIS COUNTRY. MY KIDS LAUGH AT ME IN THE DAYS -- WHEN I TELL THEM ABOUT THE DAYS OF THE COLD WAR WHEN WE USED TO PRACTICE THE DUCK AND COVER. DID I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE MOST STRATEGIC NUCLEAR TARGET THE RUSSIANS EVERY -- EVER ACQUIRED WAS THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN HOPE, ARKANSAS? FURTHER, WAS IT REALLY GOING TO MATTER IF, IN FACT, IT WAS MY ELEMENTARY AND I WOULD SOMEHOW NOT BE VAPORIZED FROM THE MUSHROOM CLOUD? DO NOT WORRY, TEACHER, I AM UNDER THE DESK. YES, I SEE THAT NUCLEAR MISSILE COMING. WHEN I TELL MY KIDS THAT, THEY LAUGHED AT ME. I WORE MY GRANDKIDS TO LAUGH AT ME WHEN I TELL THEM THAT WE USED TO HAVE TO PUT OUR TOOTHPASTE AND LOST BAGS AND TAKE OFF OUR SHOES JUST TO GET ON AN AIRPLANE. I WANT A WORLD SO SAFE THAT THIS WILL BE FUNNY TO OUR GRANDKIDS. [APPLAUSE] TONIGHT, I WANT TO BRING YOU A SIMPLE ENCOURAGEMENT. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS FAR FROM DEAD. IT MAY HAVE -- YOU MAY HAVE A SENSE THAT IT POSES A LITTLE BIT WEAKER THAN IT WAS A FEW WEEK -- A FEW YEARS AGO -- ITS POLLS IS A LITTLE BIT WEAKER THAN A WITH A FEW YEARS AGO BUT I STILL REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS THAT WE ARE ABOUT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I AM CONVINCED, WILL GIVE US ANOTHER CHANCE. I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT -- IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONCE THEY TOOK A CHANCE ON AN UNKNOWN GOVERNOR FROM HOPE, ARKANSAS. FOR MOST OF US IN THIS ROOM, IT DID NOT QUITE WORK OUT LIKE WE HAD HOPED. SO I AM CONVINCED THAT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, MAYBE WE COULD ASK AMERICA, TO GIVE US ONE MORE CHANCE. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT PART OF WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO IS TO PASS ON THIS HERITAGE. THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR YOUNGER GENERATION MAY NOT REALIZE THE SACRIFICES THAT GAVE US OUR COUNTRY. WHEN I STARTED, I TOLD ABOUT THOSE GREAT MEN THAT SIGNED THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND WHAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE SIGNING. BUT ALL THROUGH OUR HISTORY, PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP TO REGAIN -- FOR DANGER TO GIVE US OUR FREEDOM. I HAVE A SCHOOL TEACHER FRIEND IN LITTLE ROCK, ARK. WHO HAS BEEN TEACHING AT JOE T. ROBINSON HIGH SCHOOL. AND SHE IS VERY ACTIVE IN THE AMERICAN LEGION OF THE LORD. MARTHA FELT LIKE A LOT OF HER STUDENTS DID NOT APPRECIATE WHAT IT WAS TO BE AN AMERICAN. ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL IN 2005, MARTHA GOT PERMISSION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL TO TAKE ALL OF THE SCHOOL DESKS OUT OF HER CLASSROOM, WHICH SHE DID. THE KIDS WALKED IN TO THE FIRST HOUR AND SAW AN EMPTY ROOM. THEY SAID, WHERE ARE THE DESKS? AND SHE SAID, YOU NOT GET ONE UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO TO GET ONE. THEY SUGGESTED, MAYBE I GET GOOD GRADES? SHE SAID, THAT WOULD HELP, BUT NOT GIVE YOU A DESK. OTHERS SAID, WHAT IF WE BEHAVE? SHE SAID, YOU ARE GOING TO BE PAID IN MY CLASS, BUT THAT WILL NOT GIVE YOU A DEATH, EITHER. BY NOON, ALL FOUR OF THE NETWORK AFFILIATES HAD THEIR NEWS IN THE CLASSROOM. THE KIDS HAD CALL THEIR PARENTS AND SAID, SHE HAS LOST REMIND AND WE DO NOT HAVE DESKS. -- LOST HER MIND AND WOULD NOT HAVE DESKS. LAST. OF THE DAY, -- AT THE LAST HOUR OF THE DAY, SHE SAID, LET ME HELP YOU. WITH THAT, MARTHA WENT TO THE DOOR OF HER CLASSROOM AND OPEN THE DOOR. WHEN SHE DID, SHE MOTIONED AND IN WALKED 27 VETERANS. EVERYONE OF THEM WALKED INTO THE COUCH -- INTO THE KOSTROUN CARRYING A SCHOOL DESK. -- WALKED INTO THE CLASSROOM CARRYING A SCHOOL DESK. SHE SAID, YOU GUYS DO NOT HAVE TO LEARN YOUR DESK BECAUSE THESE GUYS ALREADY DID. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT FREE. SOMEBODY PAID AN AMAZING PRICE TO HAVE THEM. -- FOR US TO HAVE THEM. [APPLAUSE] I ENVISION AN AMERICA WHERE WE NOT ONLY KEEP AND RETAIN OUR FREEDOM, BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND WHERE IT CAME FROM. AND LIKE MY PARENTS' GENERATION, THE GREATEST GENERATION AS WE CALL THEM, THAT WE NOT ONLY ENJOY THAT, WE PROTECTED, PRESERVE IT, AND WE PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION AS GOOD, IF NOT BETTER, THEN WE FOUND IT. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. WHAT AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE. GOD BLESS YOU. >> REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, MIKE HUCKABEE, SPOKE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICANS",2015-11-07 17:27:50,2007-12-01,Keene,New Hampshire
http://www.c-span.org/video/?202545-1/huckabee-campaign-event,Huckabee Campaign Event,Mike Huckabee,"THIS IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES. >> THING YOU, VERY MUCH. FIRST OF ALL LET ME APOLOGIZE. FORGETTING ALL OF YOU OUT OF CLASS. I KNOW THAT IS PROBABLY THE LAST THING THAT YOU OF ONE JOB HAPPENS TODAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I GET TO PLAY WITH YOUR ROCK FANS TODAY ARE WE DOING THAT FIRST? OR AFTERWARDS? WE'RE DOING AT FIRST? AS OF LIKE MORE FUN TO ME HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD RATHER HEAR MUSIC AND A POLITICIAN TALK? >> HOW MANY OF YOUR SO SELECT YOUR BROTHER AFTER A POLITICIAN ROCK MUSIC PRICE OF A, AS FOR THIS MAN OUT HE DUMBLY NEED SERIOUS ATTENTION. WE HAVE SOME GUYS IN THE BAND COMING? COOL. [APPLAUSE]. [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE]. [MUSIC] VETO. (music) ONTARIAN [MUSIC] (music). (music). >> ANYWAYS, ON WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE BAND FOR LETTING ME PLAY WITH THEM I ACTUALLY HAVE MY OWN BAND IS CALLED CAPITAL OFFENSE. NO JOKE. WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER ABOUT 12 YEARS AND STARTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHEN I FOUND I HAD MUSICIANS IN MY OFFICE WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR AND WE STARTED OUT PLAYING IN THE BASEMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION IN JUST TO KICK AROUND AND HAVE FUN AND WE PLAYED A CHRISTMAS PARTY. AND WE PLAYED A COUPLE OF SONGS, AND NO ONE THREW FOOD S AND THAT WAS ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT WE NEEDED AND ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER ACTUALLY GET PRETTY GOOD IN OVER THE YEARS WE PLAYED AND WE OPEN FOR START -- PRICE FOR THE ROAD, WE OPENED UP WITH DAN WARDELL, WE PLAYED ON BOTH CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK POST, THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE INTO OF THE PRESIDENT AND OPERATIONS FOR PRESIDENT BUSH. A LOT OF FUN. SO, I ENJOY GETTING TO PLAY WITH YOUR P.M. TODAY AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR LIKE NUMBER ONE IN FOOTBALL AND NUMBER 2 IN SOCCER. CONGRATULATIONS. [APPLAUSE]. PERRIN NICE TO BE WITH A BUNCH OF CHAMPIONS TODAY. I WANT TO SAY, CONGRATULATIONS FOR A GREAT TRADITION. DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 1800'S, A SCHOOL, AS AN EGG -- AS DO SOME OF YOUR TEACHERS, RIGHT? SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TALKING TO A GROUP OF STUDENTS, I AM ASKED A QUESTION WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHO GETS ELECTED PRESIDENT. QUITE HONESTLY, NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE THAN ON MY LIFE. I MEAN, I AM 52 YEARS OLD, AND I LIVE OUT MY LIFE EXCESS NANCY, I MAY HAVE 3735 YEARS LEFT, IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL. BUT IF YOU GUYS LIVE OUT YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND ANOTHER 65, MAYBE PLUS YEARS LEFT. AND THE REALITY IS WHATEVER THE DECISION THE NEXT PRESIDENT MAKES WILL HAVE A FAR GREATER IMPACT ON YOUR FUTURE, ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU CAN EARN, HOW MUCH TO GOVERNOR -- GOVERNMENT WILL KEEP AND LET YOU KEEP, WHAT KIND OF WORLD YOU'LL LIVE IN A SAFE IS IT GOING TO BE OR WHETHER EVERY DAY YOU WILL WAKE UP SCARED TO DEATH. THIS SOMEONE WILL THREATEN YOUR VERY LIFE. IT WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON SOME HOW SAFE IS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD? WHAT KIND OF JOBS ARE GOING TO BE OUT THERE? HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO CAUSE TO GO TO COLLEGE? HOW LONG WILL TAKE FOR YOU TO PAY IT BACK IF YOU HAVE TO BORROW MONEY TO GO? I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT PUBLISHES AND THEN OPEN OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK PERHAPS REALLY WILL AFFECT YOUR LIVES. ONE OF THEM IS I AM REALLY CONCERNED THAT THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T HAPPEN AT THIS SCHOOL BECAUSE THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE AND IT IS NOT EASY TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL YEAR TO BE A PRETTY SERIOUS STUDENT TO COME, SO MANY OF YOU IN THE SCHOOL ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AVERAGE STUDENT. BUT HERE IS WHAT IS TREES SCARY IN AMERICA TODAY 6,000 KIDS WILL DROP OUT OF SCHOOL, 6,000 TODAY. AMONT WITH THE SAME NUMBER WILL QUIT TOMORROW IN THE SAME NUMBER WILL QUIT TOMORROW. ONE-THIRD OF ALL OF THE STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOLS TODAY WILL DRAW ABOUT, NEVER EVEN FINISHES SCHOOL. THEY ARE GOING TO BE AN EXPENSIVE BURDEN ON THE REST OF US BECAUSE BY NOT HAVING AN EDUCATION, THEIR SKILLS, THE CAPACITY TO BE EMPLOYED IN A MEANINGFUL WAY, TO BE ABLE TO PLAY -- PAY THEIR OWN WAY IS LIMITED BUT YOU KNOW THE CREDIT TRAGEDY OF THE FACT OF THEIR DIRECT OUT IS WHY THEY'RE DROPPING OUT. YOU SEE, THEY'RE NOT DROPPING OUT IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THERE QADAM, THEY ARE DROPPING OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BORED. THE EDUCATION'S SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE HAS FAILED A LOT OF STUDENTS, IT IS NOT THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE FAILED THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS FAILED BECAUSE IT IS STILL TRYING TO OPERATE 19th CENTURY METHODS TO A 21st CENTURY GENERATION. THE SCHOOL SHOULD BE BUILT AROUND YOUR INTEREST, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE BUILT AROUND THE INTEREST OF THE INSTITUTION. THE PURPOSE OF ANY INSTITUTION IS TO PERPETUATE WHAT IS BEST FOR ITS CLIENTS IN THIS CASE, THE SCHOOL. AND THE SAD THING IS THAT IN SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS AMERICA THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHOSE OWN TALENTS ARE NOT BEING TOUCHED BECAUSE WE CREATED THIS RIGID EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH REST OF THE ALL RECORDS FOR THE SUN IS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CARPET -- STUDENTS BRING I AM A LEFT PERSON BEST THINGS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LESS SIDE THE NOMINAL THE LOGIC SIDE, AND WE HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB OF PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON THAT IN THE LAST GENERATION <E> WE HAVE TO DO THAT IN A NEW KIND OF MARKET PLACE IN THE WORLD, AND I OF -- APPLAUD THAT. BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE THAT IS RELEASED TO BEN, WHEN OF REVENUE FOCUS ON THE LEFT SIDE AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL OF THE CREATIVITY AND WE CUT MUSIC IN OUR PROGRAM OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS AND WE HAVE DONE THAT, IT IS ALMOST AS IT WERE GRADED IN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS A LEFT BRAIN FUNCTIONING THAT IT VERGES SAID ITS STUDENTS ARE RIGHT BRAINS TO ENDED YOUR CREATIVE SIDE MES TO BE ASSIMILATED JUST AS MUCH AS YOUR LOGICAL SIDE, AND IF WE DON'T HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT BOUNCES BACK, YOU'RE NOT REALLY BE AN EDUCATED YOU'RE SIMPLY THE RECIPIENT OF A DATA DOWNLOAD. ENTITY OF A LAPTOP THAT AS A WONDERFUL MEMORY CAPACITY INTEGRATE DATA BASE, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE AN OPERATING SCHISM THAT FUNCTIONS YOU'RE LAPTOP IS WORTHLESS IN MIND AS WELL BE A VOTE ANCHOR BECAUSE IT IS A PROCESSOR IS, TO DO WITH THAT DATA THAT REALLY MAKES THE COMPUTER USEFUL. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE CONTINUALLY / MUSIC AND ARTS PROGRAMS OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS, AND WE HAVE LEFT A LOT OF STUDENTS BEHIND BECAUSE OF IT. ONE OF THE SMARTEST THINGS WE'RE GOING TO DO IN AMERICA IS TO RESTORE MUSIC AND ART FOR EVERY STUDENT. NOW I CAN READILY YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM. [APPLAUSE]. : KEITH RICHARDS IS 64 YEARS OLD. HE LOOKS ABOUT 107, I DON'T KNOW. STILL ROCKING. SOME OF YOU KNOW OF PAUL MICHEL KARNI, I ACTUALLY KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS THE BASS PLAYER FOR THE BEATLES. SOME OF YOU SAID I'VE HEARD MY PARENTS TALK ABOUT THEM. AND PAUL MCCARTNEY IS IN HIS MID-60S. NOBODY EVER THOUGHT THESE GUYS WOULD LAST THAT LONG. BUT MUSIC IS TIMELESS. OUR BAND OPENED FOR WILLIE NELSON. WILLIE NELSON IS 74 YEARS OLD AND HAS THE JULY ON A GUITAR LIKE A TEENAGER. HE'S AN AMAZING MUSICIAN. MY POINT IS THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN LIFE YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO OUTGROW. IT'S A LIFE SKILL. YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WHAT IN THE WORLD DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH BEING PRESIDENT? IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO IS MAKING SURE WE ARE DEVELOPING A COUNTRY THAT YOU CAN LIVE WITH, NOT LIVE IN BUT WHAT WITH AND GROWING AND SO IF YOU'VE GOT A QUESTION YOU'D LIKE TO ASK, AND I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT TO THE STUDENTS, NOT THE PRESS BECAUSE THEY GET THEIR SHOTS AT OTHER TIMES SO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION, IF YOU'LL PROBABLY THE BEST WAY WOULD BE TO COME DOWN FORWARD, IS THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM DO? YOU HAVE ANOTHER MICROPHONE YOU SAID? ON THE OTHER SIDE? OKAY. >> I WILL BE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION. >> OKAY. MAKE THIS GOOD. >> IN JANUARY 2007I QUOTE FROM YOUR WEBSITE WE MAKE SURE WE FINISH THE JOB IN IRAQ AND FINISH IT RIGHT AND IN MAY 2007 SAID AGAIN POSTING FROM THE WEBSITE WE NEED 300,000 TROOPS IN IRAQ WE MUST FINISH THE JOB OF DOES THIS MEAN YOU NEED TO SUPPORT THE DRAFT AND IF NO, HOW THE PLAN TO ENLARGE THE ARMY WITHOUT A DRAFT? >> THE QUESTION IS TO SUPPORT A DRAFT. THE ANSWER IS NO, I DON'T. WE ARE HAVING A MUCH BETTER SUCCESS WITH AN ALL VOLUNTEER ARMY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE THERE THAN WE DID WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE AGAINST THEIR WILL AND WERE FORCED TO GO. AND IT'S PRETTY EVIDENT THAT THAT HAS WORKED SO MUCH BETTER. DO I WISH THERE WAS A WAY IN WHICH ANY STUDENT WHO WANTED TO HAVE OPTIONS OF NATIONAL SERVICE, YES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE TO SEE US PURSUE IS THAT MILITARY SERVICE WOULD BE ONE OF SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR NATIONAL SERVICE THAT WOULD GIVE STUDENTS OPPORTUNITY TO EARN THEIR WAY FOR COLLEGE AND ALSO TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY. COLLEGE IS GETTING INCREDIBLY MORE EXPENSIVE. TO GO TO THE MILITARY YOU GET THE G.I. BILL AND CAN GET SOME OF THE EXPENSES PAID FOR SCHOOL. BUT THERE'S ALSO ALL OF THESE NONMILITARY OPTIONS SO THAT NATIONAL SERVICE, YOU GETTING SOMETHING TO YOUR COUNTRY AND IN EXCHANGE, HE WOULD GET THE CAPACITY TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT A FURTHER STEP IN YOUR EDUCATION. THEREFORE, I HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE KIND OF WORLD WHERE WE WOULDN'T NEED AS MANY SOLDIERS BUT FRANKLY, RIGHT NOW WE DO. AND IN FACT WE NEED MORE THAN WE HAVE. WE ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND OUR MILITARY, NOT OVERSTAFFED. BUT PART OF THE ANSWER IS TO MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT'S A GOOD OPTION FOR THEM. AND THE BEST WAYS TO MAKE IT SO THAT WE HAVE THE BEST ARMY IN THE WORLD. ONE AND THAT IS SO EFFECTIVE THAT NOBODY WANTS TO ENGAGE IN A BATTLE AND WE HAVE LESS WAR RATHER THAN MORE. DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE I DID IT AND GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO FOLLOW-UP. OKAY, GOOD. ALL RIGHT. OVER ON THIS SIDE. >> WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON EDUCATION AFFORDABILITY, AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO ACHIEVE THEM FOR THE LOWER AND MIDDLE CLASS IS? >> I DON'T WANT ANY STUDENT IN THIS WHOLE COUNTRY EVER COMING OUT HAVING A CEILING ON TOP OF THEM THAT HE CAN'T BREAK BECAUSE HE CAN'T GET THE EDUCATION. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS -- FIRST FALL, EDUCATION IS ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE K THROUGHMAC 12 BUT WE'VE GOT TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE 12th GRADE EDUCATION IS NO LONGER AN ADEQUATE LEVEL TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WORK FORCE OF TOMORROW. I ONCE SPOKE TO A GROUP OF BUSINESS LEADERS PEOPLE WHO OWN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND I ASK HOW MANY OF YOU THAT OWN BUSINESSES AND HIRE PEOPLE COULD EXIST IF EVERY ONE OF YOUR WORK FORCE, EVERY SINGLE PERSON TOP TO BOTTOM HAD NO BETTER THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND I WAITED AND NOT ONE HAND WENT UP AND SAID AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND MY QUESTION. THE OF YOU COULD AFFORD TO LIVE WITH A WORK FORCE IN WHICH NOBODY HAD BETTER THAN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND NOT ONE PERSON OUT OF 400 SOMETHING PEOPLE WHO HIRED PEOPLE SAID THEY COULD LIVE WITH THAT. WITH THAT TOLD ME WAS WHAT I PRETTY WELL ALREADY KNEW. THAT A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION IS NO LONGER ADEQUATE FOR THE WORK FORCE OF TOMORROW. IT MAY HAVE BEEN 40 YEARS AGO. IT IS NOT TODAY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO STUDENT WHO CAN'T ACCESS AT LEAST AK THROUGH 14 IF NOT KATE TO 16 AND ONE THING THAT HAS HELPED A LOT IS STATES INCLUDED MIGHT HAVE CREATED A BIG NETWORK OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT MAKE COLLEGE BOTH ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE, NOT NECESSARILY A FOURTH YEAR GO TO THE DORM AND HAVE PARTIES AND BE A PART OF THE FRATERNITY, IT MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYBODY BUT EVERYBODY CAN ADVANCED AT EDUCATION AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND THEN CREATE AVENUES OF SERVICE THAT WOULD RETURN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET ADDITIONAL EDUCATION CREDITS. IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU COMMIT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TEACH FOR FOUR YEARS IN AN INNER CITY, OR IN AN IMPOVERISHED PART OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HELP YOU THROUGH THE FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE AND FOR THAT, YOU PROMISED TO TEACH IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA AND BE WILLING TO SERVE IN A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA IN EXCHANGE FOR EDUCATIONAL CREDITS AND THE BENEFITS. IT'S A WAY IN WHICH IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE TO THE TAXPAYERS. IT'S A TRADE-OFF THREE WE ARE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR IT BUT WE GET THE BENEFIT OF YOU BEING BETTER EDUCATED AND THE COMMITTEE GETS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING SERVICE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO COSTLY TO BE PUT IN PLACE.

I'M NOT RUNNING SO MUCH AGAINST MITT ROMNEY. I WANT TO BE THE PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO RESPOND TO ME. THEY NOW BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE AND I STICK TO IT.

ONE OF SENATOR CLINTON'S STOPS WAS HERE ADD FLOYD LOCAL FOODS MARKET. >> THAT'S WHERE IT ALL BEGAN. IF YOU WILL STAND UP AND CAUCUS FOR ME ON JANUARY 3, I WILL STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR YOU THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. THEN I WILL STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY THAT I AM IN THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE I WILL WAKE UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THINKING ABOUT AND WORRYING ABOUT YOU, YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, YOUR FRIENDS, ALL THE AMERICANS WHO FEEL INVISIBLE TO THIS PRESIDENT. THERE AREN'T GOING TO BE ANY INVISIBLE PEOPLE WHEN I'M PRESIDENT. WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST ONCE AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] NOW, I HAVE A VERY HARD-WORKING CAMPAIGN STAFF, SOME OF WHOM ARE AROUND HERE. RAISE YOUR HAND, EVERYBODY ON MY CAMPAIGN STAFF. THESE WONDERFUL YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME FROM AROUND IOWA AND AROUND AMERICA, WHO REALLY BELIEVE IN OUR DEMOCRACY, WANT TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION, I'M SO PROUD OF THEM. AND ALL OF MY VOLUNTEERS AND SUPPORTERS ACROSS THIS STATE. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY WANT TO SEE ME BE PRESIDENT, BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVE NEVER CAUCUSED BEFORE. AND EVERY DAY I RUN INTO PEOPLE SAYING I HAVE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE OR I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I WAS LATE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO MASON CITY AND THERE WAS A DISABLED AIRPLANE ON THE RUNWAY THAT HAPPENED BEFORE I WAS SUPPOSED TO LAND SO I HAD TO CIRCLE UP IN THE AIR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THEY COULD MOVE THE PLANE. WE FINALLY LANDED AND WE WENT TO THE EVENT WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM MASON CITY AND THAT SURROUNDING AREA AND A WOMAN TOLD ME, SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, I DON'T SPEAK VERY WELL. I SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK. SHE SAID I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK. >> NO I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK. THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER. THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW SO NOBODY GETS WORRIED ABOUT IT. I WANT TO BRING UP TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BEING BUDDIES. THE FIRST IS EDWIN FRIDAY AND ED, WHERE IS ED? I WANT TO BRING ED UP. COME UP HERE, ED. AND COMING WITH ED IS BETTY ANN GIL. COME UP, BETTY ANN. NOW, EDWIN FRIDAY IS COMPLETELY VISUALLY IMPAIRED AND ED, LAST CAUCUS WROTE THE 1992 FOR SENATOR HARKIN. BUT HE HASN'T SENTENCED SINCE THEN. HI, ED, IT'S HILLARY CLINTON. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ED COMES TO ALL OF MY EVENTS IN THE AREA. I'M ALWAYS HAPPY THAT HE IS THERE BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT FOR ED. HE CARES ENOUGH AND IS COMMITTED ENOUGH TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS AND THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. AND ED HAS, AS A BUDDY, BETTY ANN GILL. BETTY ANN IS A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF SIOUX CITY. THERE IS WHERE HER FAMILY AND HER HEART ARE. SHE HAS NEVER CAUCUSED BEFORE. SHE IS READY TO CAUCUS. SHE HAS VOTED. A LOT OF IOWANS HAVE ALWAYS VOTED BUT THEY DON'T CAUCUS. SO BETTY ANN IS GOING TO CAUCUS THIS YEAR. AND BETTY ANN AND ED ARE GOING TO BE BUDDIES. THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY EACH GET TO THE CAUCUS AND MAYBE BRING ALONG A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE IF THEY CAN ROUND THEM UP. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ASKING ED, ED, YOU HAVEN'T CAUCUSED SINCE 1992. WHEN YOU CAUCUSED WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE WAS IT FOR YOU? BETTER THAN TELEVISION. AFTER THE FIRST ROUND WHEN THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET 15% DROP OUT, THEY'RE PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE. YOU GET THAT FLOOR WORKING AND TRY TO GET THEM. IT'S LIKE A FUN GAME. IT'S LIKE MONOPOLY, YOU SAY YOURS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT, COME OVER HERE. I'LL LOAN YOU THAT SNOW SHOVEL. AND YOU DO THAT AND IT WHITTLES DOWN AND YOU HAVE THAT ANTICIPATION AND THAT FEELING, YOU'RE HOPING THAT YOUR CANDIDATE MAKES IT BECAUSE THIS IS A PERSON YOU KNOW WILL GET THE JOB DONE. AND WHEN THAT CANDIDATE MAKES IT. IT'S A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL FEELING. >> THAT IS WONDERFUL, ED, THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND WHAT IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THROUGH YOUR MIND THIS YEAR SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE CAUCUSING THE FIRST TIME? >> I'M GOING TO BE VOTING FOR YOU. I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU GOING. I'M GOING TO START CAUCUSING. >> YOU KNOW, YOU AND ED ARE QUITE A TEAM. ED SOUNDS LIKE HE UNDERSTANDS THIS PROCESS BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE. I CAN TELL YOU. ON THESE FORM. EVERYONE TAKE OUT THIS FORM THAT WAS PASSED OUT. THERE IS A GREAT PICTURE OF RUTH AND ME ON THE FRONT, I MUST SAY, RUTH. THERE IS A FORM THAT YOU CAN JUST TEAR OUT, IT'S PRETTY EASY, IT'S PERFORATED. IT CAN'T BE HARD TO DO. IF YOU WILL FILL THAT OUT. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GET THE NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO BE A BUDDY. IF YOU START FILLING IT OUT, I WANT TO TELL YOU A COUPLE OF STORIES. I WAS IN CEDAR RAPIDS AND A WOMAN SAID TO ME THAT SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING OF HER MOTHER. R@/aa@@ @ @ @ A)@ @ HER MOTHER WAS BED-RIDDEN, AND SHE COULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE. SHE SAID, I WOULD LOVE TO CAUCUS FOR YOU, BUT IT IS AT NIGHT, AND I DO NOT KNOW WHO I WILL GET TO TAKE CARE OF MY MOTHER. I TOLD HER WE WOULD FIND A RESPONSIBLE WHILE AND YOU'RE FROM OUT OF STATE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO HELP. -- I TOLD HER WE WOULD FIND A RESPONSIBLE VOLUNTEER. AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN TOLD ME HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS -- HE HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO BRIT IS A BIT, BUT SHE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR, AND I SAID, WE WILL BE HERE -- THE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HELP OUT, BUT SHE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR, AND I SAID, WE WILL BE HERE. .

http://www.c-span.org/video/?202711-1/clinton-campaign-event,Clinton Campaign Event,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON, IOWA, WHERE SHE HELD A TOWN HALL MEETING AT THE LOCATE FIREHOUSE. THE FORMER FIRST DAUGHTER APPEARED IN A CAMPAIGN AD FOR HER MOM. HERE IS A LOOK AT THE AD FOLLOWED BY THE CAMPAIGN EVENT IN WASHINGTON. >> I'M THRILLED THAT I HAVE MY MOTHER AND MY DAUGHTER WITH ME TONIGHT. MY MOTHER, DOROTHY RODHAM AND MY DAUGHTER CHELSEY CLINTON. >> I SEE SO MANY FAMILIES THAT SHARE THE SAME VALUES I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH. MY MOM TOLD ME TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF AND TO STAND UP FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN. I'M PROUD TO LIVE BY THOSE VALUES, BUT I'M MOST PROUD OF KNOWING I HAVE PASSED THEM ON TO. I AM HILLARY CLINTON, AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE. >> AND IN WASHINGTON, IOWA, CHELSEY CLINTON AND DOROTHY RODHAM ATTENDED THE EVENT. >> WE HAVE MORE JOBS IN AMERICA THAT WILL HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WILL CREATE JOBS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL. THE OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES TAKE OUR MONEY AND USE IT AGAINST US. I DON'T WANT THAT TO CONTINUE. THAT IS -- SHAME ON US IF WE LET THAT CONTINUE. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, EVERY ONE OF US CAN BE MORE ENERGY INITIATE, IN OUR HOMES, IN OUR BUSINESSES, IN OUR GOVERNMENT. AS SOON AS I'M NAURGED PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO -- INAUGURATED PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO SIGN AN ORDER THAT THEY CAN'T BUILD MORE BUILDINGS UNLESS THEY'RE ENERGY EFFICIENT. YOU CAN MOVE TOWARDS AUTOMATIC SWITCHES SO LIGHTS CAN GO OUT. YOU CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO SAVE ON HEATING AND THESE SOUND LIKE LITTLE THINGS BUT IF EVERY ONE OF US DID IT, IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE CAN GET MORE GAS MILEAGE OUT OF OUR CARS, WE CAN HAVE THE BIOFUELS, I HAVE BEEN TO A COUPLE OF BIOKEY DEE SELL PLANTS IN THE STATE. THEY DIDN'T EXIST TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, THEY ARE EMPLOYING PEOPLE. WHAT WE SEE IS FIVE MILLION OR MORE JOBS IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS COMING DIRECTLY OUT OF CHANGES IN THE WAY WE DO ENERGY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO FUND WHAT A CALL A STEEG FUND? WE'RE TAKING THE TAX SUBSIDIZE AWAY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES. THEY DON'T NEED YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO MAKE A PROFIT ANYMORE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE DO THIS, WE'RE ALSO GOING TO START COMBATING GLOBAL WARMING, WHICH IS THE REAL PROBLEM. WE HAVE IGNORED IT. IT'S CREEPING UP ON US AND IF WE DON'T START LEADING, WE'RE GOING TO BE NOT ONLY ENDANGERING A LOT OF OUR WEATHER PATTERNS AND OTHER PROBLEMS WE'RE GOING TO LIVE WITH, BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE LOSING OUT IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIST. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T PRODUCE IT HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO START INNOCENT ADVISING PEOPLE TO DO THAT AS WELL. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS AS GOING TO THE MOON LIKE PRESIDENT KENNEDY CHALLENGED US TO DO. LET'S CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS. WE'RE AMERICANS. LET'S START TO BE INNOVATIVE AGAIN. WE GOT TO FINALLY HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. [APPLAUSE] NOW HERE IS MY PLAN, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW I THINK WE CAN DO THIS. IT'S NOT GOVERNMENT RUN, NOBODY TELLS WHAT DOCTOR TO GO TO OR WHAT HOSPITAL TO GO TO EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL PROBABLY SAY. WHAT IT DOES IS GIVE YOU CHOICES ABOUT WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE AND GIVE YOU HELP THROUGH THE TAX CODE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT HEALTH CARE. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UNINSURED, HAS NO HEALTH INSURANCE? AND HOW MANY YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, IT COULD BE YOU WHO HAVE INSURANCE BUT WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT BECAUSE YOUR DOCTOR SAYS, HERE IS THE OPERATION YOU NEED OR HERE IS THE TREATMENT YOU NEED, THE INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T PAY FOR IT. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE? WE HAVE TWO BIG PROBLEMS. EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THE UNINSURED AND THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THAT'S A MORAL PROBLEM AS WELL AS AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM. SO IF THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE PAID THEIR PREMIUMS, THEY HAVE DONE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY PULLS THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM. IF WE HAD TIME, I BET WE COULD TELL 10, 20, 30 STORIES BECAUSE I SURE CAN. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE TESTIMONIAL THAT I HAD ON THE T.V. FROM A MAN THAT I HELPED WHOSE SON NEEDED A SERIOUS OPERATION AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT HE PAID HIS PREMIUMS TO, HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE SECURE, HE HAD NEVER WORRIED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY. THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS NO, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAID. WE FOUGHT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND KIND OF EMBARRASSED THEM INTO CHANGING THEIR MINDS. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A UNITED STATES SENATOR TO GET HELP FOR A FATHER FOR HIS SON TO GET A-HEAVY SAVING OPERATION. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. HERE IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE NOW AND YOU'RE HAPPY THROUGH IT. YOU GET IT THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER. MAYBE YOU GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL, NOTHING CHANGES. NOTHING. YOU KEEP THE HEALTH CARE YOU HAVE. IF YOU'RE UNINSURED OR IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE BUT IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD DEAL AND MAYBE IT DOESN'T COVER YOUR PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIKE YOUR DIABETES, FOR EXAMPLE, THEN WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN TO EVERY AMERICAN, CONGRESS HAS A GREAT PLAN, I CAN ATTEST TO THAT, TO TAKE CARE OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND ALL MED EMPLOYEES, NINE MILLION PEOPLE ALL TOGETHER. THERE ARE OVER 250 CHOICES. YOU DON'T HEAR A 22-YEAR-OLD YOUNG PERSON, NOT MARRIED YET, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAME KIND OF INSURANCE AS A COUPLE WITH TWO LITTLE KIDS. 250-PLUS CHOICES. IT'S AT AN AVERAGE COST LESS THAN WHAT YOU CAN GET OUTSIDE THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER OR ON YOUR OWN. IF YOU NEED HELP BUYING IT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS. WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO DENY YOU COVERAGE OR DENY YOU ON THE BASIS OF A PREEXISTING CONDITION. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW ARE YOU TODAY? CLASSY. I KEEP COMING. HELLO. WOULD THAT NOT BE A GOOD THING? I DON'T THINK THE SMALL STATES WOULD EVER RETURN CHANGE THAT. THAT IS WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO WITH YOUR HELP. I NEED YOU CAUCUSING FOR ME. HOW'RE YOU DOING? THANK YOU. THAT MEANS A MUCH TO ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR COMING. OK. I THINK THAT I ALREADY DID. >> WE NEED THE RECORDS IN WRITING. >> I AM SENDING IT TO THEM BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW EVERYTHING THAT I SIGNED. WE WILL DO THAT. THANK YOU. >> I AM RIGHT BEHIND YOU. >> HOW WERE YOU? I NEED YOUR HELP. HOW WOULD YOU, DEAR? THAT WOULD BE SUPER. I NEEDED TO GET TO THE CAUCUS FOR ME ON JANUARY 3RD. IT BANKING. -- THANK YOU. >> THEIR EGO. THE ONE YOUR PICTURE? -- THERE YOU GO. THE ONE YOUR PICTURE? -- DO YOU WHAT YOUR PICTURE? THANK YOU. HOW'RE YOU? WOW. BUT DO SO MUCH. -- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THERE IS ANOTHER ONE. >> 19. -- THANK YOU. >> BACK UP A LITTLE BIT POLICE. -- BACK UP A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE. >> HE IS STILL INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. >> THAT IS WONDERFUL. THANK YOU. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT. I HOPE THE DUKAKIS FOR ME. >> I WILL. -- I HOPE THAT YOU CAUCUS FOR ME. >> I WILL. >> I HAD SEEN IT. IT IS ALL MINE. HOW LOVE TO KNOW MORE. -- I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE. THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU FOR COMING. >> I WANT TO SHAKE HER HAND. >> TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE. >> THANK YOU AND I HOPE THE DUKAKIS FROM AMMAN. >> I'M CERTAINLY CONSIDERING IT. -- I HOPE THE NEW CAUCUS FOR MY MOM. CAN I ASK YOU WHAT WOULD PUSH TOWARD THE EDGE? >> I AM WORKING ON IT. WE ARE GOING TO GO CAUCUSING GET EDUCATED ON ALL THE ISSUES. I LIKE A LOT OF WHAT YOUR MOM HAS TO SAY. I WILL BE AT THE CAUCUS. THAT WILL HELP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. >> WHETHER YOU OUGHT TO NOW? >> I LIVE AND WORK IN NEW YORK. I'M HERE TODAY. >> IT'S GOT TO BE HARD ON YOU? >> I'M REALLY PROUD OF MY MOM. I HOPE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ON MY MOM. >> SHE'S A VERY REAL PERSON. I APPRECIATE HER. AND WE WATCHED HER. IT'S A TOUGH DEAL AND I TAKE A LOT OF RISKS. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT HO HELP TONIGHT. YOUR HANDS ARE COLD. >> I KNOW, I'M SITTING NEXT TO THE DOOR. >> HI, HOW ARE YOU? >> A LONG DAY? >> HAVE A GOOD TRIP HOME. >> THANK YOU. >> THAT'S QUITE COOL. >> WHAT A MODEL. >> SHE IS. >> THANK YOU. >> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER GOTTEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS. WE CAME TONIGHT. THE LAST MINUTE WE DECIDED TO AND I'M GLAD WE DID. >> I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. >> IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. >> MAY I TAKE YOUR PICTURE? >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE IN IT? >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HOPE YOU'LL CAUCUS FOR MY MOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING. >> NO PROBLEM. >> I FEEL LIKE A TREE HUGGER MYSELF. THEY SAY AT WORK. WE GOT ALL THE NEW COMPUTERS AND I'M MAKING SURE EVERYTHING GETS RECYCLED. >> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT. >> CHELSEY, I SAW YOU GROW UP WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD WHEN YOUR DAD WAS IN OFFICE. >> A LONG TIME AGO. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING. THANK YOU. >> THANKS FOR COMING. >> MIND IF I GET A PICTURE TAKEN WITH YOU? >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. SUPPORT MY MOM. >> LOOKING BETTER. >> WHAT'S GOING TO PUSH YOU OVER THE EDGE? >> I DON'T KNOW. BETWEEN YOUR MOM AND OBAMA. SHE IS REAL GOOD. >> I THINK SO SO TOO. >> WHERE DO YOU LIVE? >> I WORK IN NEW YORK. >> DO YOU WORK FOR A BOY COMPANY OR SOMETHING SOME. >> -- BOOK COMPANY OR SOMETHING? >> NO I WORK IN FINANCE. >> LET ME KNOW, I WOULD LIKE A HOT TIP. >> I JUST STARTED SO I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET. >> WHEN DID YOU HOOK UP WITH YOUR MOM AGAIN, JUST NOW? >> YEAH. >> ARE YOU GOING TO BE WITH US FOR A WHILE? >> UNTIL MONDAY, AND FOR THE HOLIDAYS. >> EVERYONE WANTS TO COME TO IOWA FOR THE HOLIDAYS. >> I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> HI CHELSEY. I'M HIS WIFE. >> WE'RE WORKING ON HIM. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR COMING. >> I HOPE YOU SUPPORT MY MOM. >> I DO. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> I'M FROM ARKANSAS. >> NO WAY, REALLY? >> LITTLE ROCK. >> THAT'S GREAT. >> I LOVE LITTLE ROCK. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING OF THE. >> GOT TO SUPPORT THEM.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?72414-1/clinton-campaign-fundraiser,Clinton Campaign Fundraiser,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON, IOWA, WHERE SHE HELD A TOWN HALL MEETING AT THE LOCATE FIREHOUSE. THE FORMER FIRST DAUGHTER APPEARED IN A CAMPAIGN AD FOR HER MOM. HERE IS A LOOK AT THE AD FOLLOWED BY THE CAMPAIGN EVENT IN WASHINGTON. >> I'M THRILLED THAT I HAVE MY MOTHER AND MY DAUGHTER WITH ME TONIGHT. MY MOTHER, DOROTHY RODHAM AND MY DAUGHTER CHELSEY CLINTON. >> I SEE SO MANY FAMILIES THAT SHARE THE SAME VALUES I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH. MY MOM TOLD ME TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF AND TO STAND UP FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN. I'M PROUD TO LIVE BY THOSE VALUES, BUT I'M MOST PROUD OF KNOWING I HAVE PASSED THEM ON TO. I AM HILLARY CLINTON, AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE. >> AND IN WASHINGTON, IOWA, CHELSEY CLINTON AND DOROTHY RODHAM ATTENDED THE EVENT. >> WE HAVE MORE JOBS IN AMERICA THAT WILL HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WILL CREATE JOBS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL. THE OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES TAKE OUR MONEY AND USE IT AGAINST US. I DON'T WANT THAT TO CONTINUE. THAT IS -- SHAME ON US IF WE LET THAT CONTINUE. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, EVERY ONE OF US CAN BE MORE ENERGY INITIATE, IN OUR HOMES, IN OUR BUSINESSES, IN OUR GOVERNMENT. AS SOON AS I'M NAURGED PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO -- INAUGURATED PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO SIGN AN ORDER THAT THEY CAN'T BUILD MORE BUILDINGS UNLESS THEY'RE ENERGY EFFICIENT. YOU CAN MOVE TOWARDS AUTOMATIC SWITCHES SO LIGHTS CAN GO OUT. YOU CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO SAVE ON HEATING AND THESE SOUND LIKE LITTLE THINGS BUT IF EVERY ONE OF US DID IT, IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE CAN GET MORE GAS MILEAGE OUT OF OUR CARS, WE CAN HAVE THE BIOFUELS, I HAVE BEEN TO A COUPLE OF BIOKEY DEE SELL PLANTS IN THE STATE. THEY DIDN'T EXIST TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, THEY ARE EMPLOYING PEOPLE. WHAT WE SEE IS FIVE MILLION OR MORE JOBS IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS COMING DIRECTLY OUT OF CHANGES IN THE WAY WE DO ENERGY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO FUND WHAT A CALL A STEEG FUND? WE'RE TAKING THE TAX SUBSIDIZE AWAY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES. THEY DON'T NEED YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO MAKE A PROFIT ANYMORE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE DO THIS, WE'RE ALSO GOING TO START COMBATING GLOBAL WARMING, WHICH IS THE REAL PROBLEM. WE HAVE IGNORED IT. IT'S CREEPING UP ON US AND IF WE DON'T START LEADING, WE'RE GOING TO BE NOT ONLY ENDANGERING A LOT OF OUR WEATHER PATTERNS AND OTHER PROBLEMS WE'RE GOING TO LIVE WITH, BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE LOSING OUT IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIST. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T PRODUCE IT HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO START INNOCENT ADVISING PEOPLE TO DO THAT AS WELL. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS AS GOING TO THE MOON LIKE PRESIDENT KENNEDY CHALLENGED US TO DO. LET'S CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS. WE'RE AMERICANS. LET'S START TO BE INNOVATIVE AGAIN. WE GOT TO FINALLY HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. [APPLAUSE] NOW HERE IS MY PLAN, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW I THINK WE CAN DO THIS. IT'S NOT GOVERNMENT RUN, NOBODY TELLS WHAT DOCTOR TO GO TO OR WHAT HOSPITAL TO GO TO EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL PROBABLY SAY. WHAT IT DOES IS GIVE YOU CHOICES ABOUT WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE AND GIVE YOU HELP THROUGH THE TAX CODE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT HEALTH CARE. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UNINSURED, HAS NO HEALTH INSURANCE? AND HOW MANY YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, IT COULD BE YOU WHO HAVE INSURANCE BUT WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT BECAUSE YOUR DOCTOR SAYS, HERE IS THE OPERATION YOU NEED OR HERE IS THE TREATMENT YOU NEED, THE INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T PAY FOR IT. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE? WE HAVE TWO BIG PROBLEMS. EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THE UNINSURED AND THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THAT'S A MORAL PROBLEM AS WELL AS AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM. SO IF THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE PAID THEIR PREMIUMS, THEY HAVE DONE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY PULLS THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM. IF WE HAD TIME, I BET WE COULD TELL 10, 20, 30 STORIES BECAUSE I SURE CAN. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE TESTIMONIAL THAT I HAD ON THE T.V. FROM A MAN THAT I HELPED WHOSE SON NEEDED A SERIOUS OPERATION AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT HE PAID HIS PREMIUMS TO, HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE SECURE, HE HAD NEVER WORRIED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY. THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS NO, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAID. WE FOUGHT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND KIND OF EMBARRASSED THEM INTO CHANGING THEIR MINDS. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A UNITED STATES SENATOR TO GET HELP FOR A FATHER FOR HIS SON TO GET A-HEAVY SAVING OPERATION. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. HERE IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE NOW AND YOU'RE HAPPY THROUGH IT. YOU GET IT THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER. MAYBE YOU GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL, NOTHING CHANGES. NOTHING. YOU KEEP THE HEALTH CARE YOU HAVE.

MY MOM TOLD ME TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF AND TO STAND UP FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN. I'M PROUD TO LIVE BY THOSE VALUES, BUT I'M MOST PROUD OF KNOWING I HAVE PASSED THEM ON TO. I AM HILLARY CLINTON, AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE. >> AND IN WASHINGTON, IOWA, CHELSEY CLINTON AND DOROTHY RODHAM ATTENDED THE EVENT. >> WE HAVE MORE JOBS IN AMERICA THAT WILL HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WILL CREATE JOBS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL. THE OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES TAKE OUR MONEY AND USE IT AGAINST US. I DON'T WANT THAT TO CONTINUE. THAT IS -- SHAME ON US IF WE LET THAT CONTINUE. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, EVERY ONE OF US CAN BE MORE ENERGY INITIATE, IN OUR HOMES, IN OUR BUSINESSES, IN OUR GOVERNMENT. AS SOON AS I'M NAURGED PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO -- INAUGURATED PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO SIGN AN ORDER THAT THEY CAN'T BUILD MORE BUILDINGS UNLESS THEY'RE ENERGY EFFICIENT. YOU CAN MOVE TOWARDS AUTOMATIC SWITCHES SO LIGHTS CAN GO OUT. YOU CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO SAVE ON HEATING AND THESE SOUND LIKE LITTLE THINGS BUT IF EVERY ONE OF US DID IT, IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE CAN GET MORE GAS MILEAGE OUT OF OUR CARS, WE CAN HAVE THE BIOFUELS, I HAVE BEEN TO A COUPLE OF BIOKEY DEE SELL PLANTS IN THE STATE. THEY DIDN'T EXIST TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, THEY ARE EMPLOYING PEOPLE. WHAT WE SEE IS FIVE MILLION OR MORE JOBS IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS COMING DIRECTLY OUT OF CHANGES IN THE WAY WE DO ENERGY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO FUND WHAT A CALL A STEEG FUND? WE'RE TAKING THE TAX SUBSIDIZE AWAY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES. THEY DON'T NEED YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO MAKE A PROFIT ANYMORE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE DO THIS, WE'RE ALSO GOING TO START COMBATING GLOBAL WARMING, WHICH IS THE REAL PROBLEM. WE HAVE IGNORED IT. IT'S CREEPING UP ON US AND IF WE DON'T START LEADING, WE'RE GOING TO BE NOT ONLY ENDANGERING A LOT OF OUR WEATHER PATTERNS AND OTHER PROBLEMS WE'RE GOING TO LIVE WITH, BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE LOSING OUT IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIST. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T PRODUCE IT HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO START INNOCENT ADVISING PEOPLE TO DO THAT AS WELL. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS AS GOING TO THE MOON LIKE PRESIDENT KENNEDY CHALLENGED US TO DO. LET'S CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS. WE'RE AMERICANS. LET'S START TO BE INNOVATIVE AGAIN. WE GOT TO FINALLY HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. [APPLAUSE] NOW HERE IS MY PLAN, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW I THINK WE CAN DO THIS. IT'S NOT GOVERNMENT RUN, NOBODY TELLS WHAT DOCTOR TO GO TO OR WHAT HOSPITAL TO GO TO EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL PROBABLY SAY. WHAT IT DOES IS GIVE YOU CHOICES ABOUT WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE AND GIVE YOU HELP THROUGH THE TAX CODE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT HEALTH CARE. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UNINSURED, HAS NO HEALTH INSURANCE? AND HOW MANY YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, IT COULD BE YOU WHO HAVE INSURANCE BUT WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT BECAUSE YOUR DOCTOR SAYS, HERE IS THE OPERATION YOU NEED OR HERE IS THE TREATMENT YOU NEED, THE INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T PAY FOR IT. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE? WE HAVE TWO BIG PROBLEMS. EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THE UNINSURED AND THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THAT'S A MORAL PROBLEM AS WELL AS AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM. SO IF THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE PAID THEIR PREMIUMS, THEY HAVE DONE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY PULLS THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM. IF WE HAD TIME, I BET WE COULD TELL 10, 20, 30 STORIES BECAUSE I SURE CAN. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE TESTIMONIAL THAT I HAD ON THE T.V. FROM A MAN THAT I HELPED WHOSE SON NEEDED A SERIOUS OPERATION AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT HE PAID HIS PREMIUMS TO, HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE SECURE, HE HAD NEVER WORRIED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY. THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS NO, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAID. WE FOUGHT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND KIND OF EMBARRASSED THEM INTO CHANGING THEIR MINDS. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A UNITED STATES SENATOR TO GET HELP FOR A FATHER FOR HIS SON TO GET A-HEAVY SAVING OPERATION. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. HERE IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE NOW AND YOU'RE HAPPY THROUGH IT. YOU GET IT THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER. MAYBE YOU GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL, NOTHING CHANGES. NOTHING. YOU KEEP THE HEALTH CARE YOU HAVE. IF YOU'RE UNINSURED OR IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE BUT IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD DEAL AND MAYBE IT DOESN'T COVER YOUR PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIKE YOUR DIABETES, FOR EXAMPLE, THEN WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN TO EVERY AMERICAN, CONGRESS HAS A GREAT PLAN, I CAN ATTEST TO THAT, TO TAKE CARE OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND ALL MED EMPLOYEES, NINE MILLION PEOPLE ALL TOGETHER. THERE ARE OVER 250 CHOICES. YOU DON'T HEAR A 22-YEAR-OLD YOUNG PERSON, NOT MARRIED YET, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAME KIND OF INSURANCE AS A COUPLE WITH TWO LITTLE KIDS. 250-PLUS CHOICES. IT'S AT AN AVERAGE COST LESS THAN WHAT YOU CAN GET OUTSIDE THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER OR ON YOUR OWN. IF YOU NEED HELP BUYING IT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS. WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO DENY YOU COVERAGE OR DENY YOU ON THE BASIS OF A PREEXISTING CONDITION. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW ARE YOU TODAY? CLASSY. I KEEP COMING. HELLO. WOULD THAT NOT BE A GOOD THING? I DON'T THINK THE SMALL STATES WOULD EVER RETURN CHANGE THAT. THAT IS WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO WITH YOUR HELP. I NEED YOU CAUCUSING FOR ME. HOW'RE YOU DOING? THANK YOU. THAT MEANS A MUCH TO ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR COMING. OK. I THINK THAT I ALREADY DID. >> WE NEED THE RECORDS IN WRITING. >> I AM SENDING IT TO THEM BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW EVERYTHING THAT I SIGNED. WE WILL DO THAT. THANK YOU. >> I AM RIGHT BEHIND YOU. >> HOW WERE YOU? I NEED YOUR HELP. HOW WOULD YOU, DEAR? THAT WOULD BE SUPER. I NEEDED TO GET TO THE CAUCUS FOR ME ON JANUARY 3RD. IT BANKING. -- THANK YOU. >> THEIR EGO. THE ONE YOUR PICTURE? -- THERE YOU GO. THE ONE YOUR PICTURE? -- DO YOU WHAT YOUR PICTURE? THANK YOU. HOW'RE YOU? WOW. BUT DO SO MUCH. -- THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND KEEPING YOUR QUESTION. -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY. THERE YOU GO. HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. I AM A BIG FAN OF HER. PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY WELCOME REFORM. THANK YOU FOR COMING AND BRINGING THEM. I'M SO HAPPY. I REPRESENT ALL THOSE FARMERS IN NEW YORK. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN'T HELP THEM. HOW'RE YOU? THERE IS ANOTHER ONE. >> 19. -- THANK YOU. >> BACK UP A LITTLE BIT POLICE. -- BACK UP A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE. >> HE IS STILL INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. >> THAT IS WONDERFUL. THANK YOU. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT. I HOPE THE DUKAKIS FOR ME. >> I WILL. -- I HOPE THAT YOU CAUCUS FOR ME. >> I WILL. >> I HAD SEEN IT. IT IS ALL MINE. HOW LOVE TO KNOW MORE. -- I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE. THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU FOR COMING. >> I WANT TO SHAKE HER HAND. >> TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE. >> THANK YOU AND I HOPE THE DUKAKIS FROM AMMAN. >> I'M CERTAINLY CONSIDERING IT. -- I HOPE THE NEW CAUCUS FOR MY MOM. CAN I ASK YOU WHAT WOULD PUSH TOWARD THE EDGE? >> I AM WORKING ON IT. WE ARE GOING TO GO CAUCUSING GET EDUCATED ON ALL THE ISSUES. I LIKE A LOT OF WHAT YOUR MOM HAS TO SAY. I WILL BE AT THE CAUCUS. THAT WILL HELP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. >> WHETHER YOU OUGHT TO NOW? >> I LIVE AND WORK IN NEW YORK. I'M HERE TODAY. >> IT'S GOT TO BE HARD ON YOU? >> I'M REALLY PROUD OF MY MOM. I HOPE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ON MY MOM. >> SHE'S A VERY REAL PERSON. I APPRECIATE HER. AND WE WATCHED HER. IT'S A TOUGH DEAL AND I TAKE A LOT OF RISKS. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT HO HELP TONIGHT. YOUR HANDS ARE COLD. >> I KNOW, I'M SITTING NEXT TO THE DOOR. >> HI, HOW ARE YOU? >> A LONG DAY? >> HAVE A GOOD TRIP HOME. >> THANK YOU. >> THAT'S QUITE COOL. >> WHAT A MODEL. >> SHE IS. >> THANK YOU. >> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER GOTTEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS. WE CAME TONIGHT. THE LAST MINUTE WE DECIDED TO AND I'M GLAD WE DID. >> I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. >> IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. >> MAY I TAKE YOUR PICTURE? >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE IN IT? >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HOPE YOU'LL CAUCUS FOR MY MOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING. >> NO PROBLEM. >> I FEEL LIKE A TREE HUGGER MYSELF. THEY SAY AT WORK. WE GOT ALL THE NEW COMPUTERS AND I'M MAKING SURE EVERYTHING GETS RECYCLED. >> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT. >> CHELSEY, I SAW YOU GROW UP WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD WHEN YOUR DAD WAS IN OFFICE. >> A LONG TIME AGO. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING. THANK YOU. >> THANKS FOR COMING. >> MIND IF I GET A PICTURE TAKEN WITH YOU? >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. SUPPORT MY MOM. >> LOOKING BETTER. >> WHAT'S GOING TO PUSH YOU OVER THE EDGE? >> I DON'T KNOW. BETWEEN YOUR MOM AND OBAMA. SHE IS REAL GOOD. >> I THINK SO SO TOO. >> WHERE DO YOU LIVE? >> I WORK IN NEW YORK. >> DO YOU WORK FOR A BOY COMPANY OR SOMETHING SOME. >> -- BOOK COMPANY OR SOMETHING? >> NO I WORK IN FINANCE. >> LET ME KNOW, I WOULD LIKE A HOT TIP. >> I JUST STARTED SO I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET. >> WHEN DID YOU HOOK UP WITH YOUR MOM AGAIN, JUST NOW? >> YEAH. >> ARE YOU GOING TO BE WITH US FOR A WHILE? >> UNTIL MONDAY, AND FOR THE HOLIDAYS. >> EVERYONE WANTS TO COME TO IOWA FOR THE HOLIDAYS. >> I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> HI CHELSEY. I'M HIS WIFE. >> WE'RE WORKING ON HIM. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR COMING. >> I HOPE YOU SUPPORT MY MOM. >> I DO. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> I'M FROM ARKANSAS. >> NO WAY, REALLY? >> LITTLE ROCK. >> THAT'S GREAT. >> I LOVE LITTLE ROCK. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING OF THE. >> GOT TO SUPPORT THEM.

WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY GROUP TONIGHT. I CAN'T GET OVER IT. YOU ARE SO KIND TO BE HERE. AND TO SUPPORT AMERICA'S MAJORITY. YOU KNOW, THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE DRAWN TO LEADERS THAT ARE OPTIMISTIC, THAT HAVE A VISION FOR THE FUTURE, THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR GOOD JOBS FOR OUR CITIZENS, THAT ARE WORKING TO CREATE GOOD SCHOOLS, AND THAT'S WHY WE SAW A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS GET ELECTED, IN PART WITH YOUR HELP. THEY'RE HERE TODAY. I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO ERNIE FLETCHER, OUR NEW GOVERNOR, HAILLY BARBOUR AND CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. STAND UP. COME ON. THERE IS A SENATOR FROM MY STATE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD, THAT WANTS TO GET ELECTED PRESIDENT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WANTS TO DO THAT, BECAUSE IF HE WON, HE'D HAVE TO MOVE INTO A SMALLER HOUSE. BUT WILL ROGERS SAID THAT HE DOESN'T MAKE JOKES, HE JUST GOES TO WASHINGTON, OBSERVES GOVERNMENT, AND REPORTS THE FACTS, AND SO I WENT TODAY TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE HUMOR TO A WEBSITE. I WENT TO A WEBSITE OF ONE OF THE PEEMT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. IT HAD A VERY IMPORTANT TITLE, SAID REVIVING AMERICAN MANUFACTURING. I SAID THAT'S IMPORTANT. THAT'S SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO. LET'S SEE WHAT THIS CANDIDATE HAS TO SAY. I COULDN'T WRITE THIS FUNNIER IF I WERE TRYING. IT MENTIONS THE CANDIDATE WILL SAVE JOBS BY ENDING THE UNPATRIOTIC PRACTICE OF U.S. CORPORATIONS MOVING OFFSHORE SIMPLY TO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF OUR NATION'S TAX BURDEN. THE NEXT SENTENCE, TO CREATE NEW JOBS, THIS SENATOR WILL PROVIDE NEW TAX BREAKS TO MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCE GOODS AND CREATE JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES. NOW IF THAT'S NOT COMING DOWN ON BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT. WHAT I'M PLEASED TO DO IS TO STAND HERE WITH THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND WITH YOU WHO CARE ABOUT AMERICA'S MAJORITY, AND TO STAND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR SOMETHING. WHO WE KNOW EXACTLY AND PRECISELY WHERE HE STANDS. I'M PROUD TO STAND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR WINNING THE WAR AGAINST TERROR, FOR A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR BRINGING ACCOUNTABILITY INTO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND MAKING THEM THE KIND OF SCHOOLS THAT GIVE KIDS A FUTURE THEY NEED, THE KIND OF PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR PROVIDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO OUR SENIORS. FINALLY, TO THE KIND OF PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT EVERY DAY FOR GOOD JOBS FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY. I'M PROUD, LIKE ALL THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, TO STAND WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GEORGE BUSH. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THERE IS ONE MORE PERSON I WANT TO HAVE STAND, AND THAT'S THE GREAT GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEVADA. KENNY GLEN, YOU KNOW THIS MAN. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN. HE WAS A TEACHER, A SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT, HE'S AN EDUCATION GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR, COME TAKE IT AWAY. VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS' ASSOCIATION. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE EFFORTS IN HELPING THE RGA SET UP A FANTASTIC RECORD IN FUND RAISING FOR ALL OF OUR FUTURE CANDIDATES AND ESPECIALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GEORGE W. BUSH. I'M PROUD, VERY PROUD, TO AND PART OF THIS FINE ORGANIZATION. THESE GOVERNORS ARE VERY TALENTED. IT'S A GROUP OF MANAGERS AND VISIONARIES. I'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL BY BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THEY'RE A FORMER CONGRESSMAN, SENATOR, STATE LEGISLATURES, BEARS AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. LAST YEAR WE WERE AGGRESSIVELY INVOLVED IN THE GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGNS AND BECAUSE OF OUR EFFORTS WITH YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR MIGHTY SUPPORT, WE WERE ABLE TO ELECT THESE THREE GREAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND ALMOST ATTAIN THE ELECTION OF THE FOURTH ONE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AGGRESSIVE THIS YEAR, BUT WE WILL SHEPHERD OUR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THE HARD-EARNED DOLLARS THAT YOU CONTRIBUTE ARE USED TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS AND THE 11 RACES THAT WE'LL BE FACING FOR GUBERNATORIAL POSITIONS IN THE YEAR 2004. I WANT TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO THANK YOU, THE SUPPORTERS OF RGA. NOT ONLY DO WE THANK YOU FOR THE DOLLARS YOU CONTRIBUTE TO HELP ELECT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, WE ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE WISDOM AND THE COUNSEL THAT YOU GIVE US. THIS ROOM IS FILLED WITH ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE, INDIVIDUALS, THAT HAVE GREAT IDEAS AND GREAT THOUGHTS AND GREAT ADVICE FOR US. MANY OF YOU GAVE ME SOME OF THAT AS I WALKED THROUGH THE CROWD TONIGHT. AND I TRULY APPRECIATE IT. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU HAS SOME GOOD IDEAS AND IT'S OUR JOB NOT TO ALWAYS COME UP WITH THE IDEAS. IT'S OUR JOB TO RECOGNIZE GOOD IDEAS FROM THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE ALL ACROSS THIS GREAT LAND. EACH OF YOU CAN OFFER IDEAS ON IMPROVING HEALTH CARE AND MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT. AND PROVIDING FOR MORE RELIABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY. YOU ARE GREAT AMERICANS WHO DON'T JUST SIT ON THE SIDE. YOU GET INVOLVED.

IT IS MY PLEASURE TONIGHT TO INTRODUCE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION BOB TAFT OF OHIO. YOUR FRIEND AND MY FRIEND. [ APPLAUSE ] >> GOVERNOR TAFT BEGAN HIS CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE AS VOLUNTEER FOR THE PEACE CORPS IN EAST AFRICA. HE HAS SERVED OHIO AS A MEMBER OF THE OHIO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AS A HAMILTON COUNTY COMMISSIONER, AND AS OHIO'S SECRETARY OF STATE. SINCE BEING SWORN IN AS OHIO'S 67th GOVERNOR, IN 1999, GOVERNOR TAFT HAS FOCUSED ON ATTRACTING HIGH-PAYING JOBS TO THE STATE OF OHIO. HE'S BEEN POSITIONING OHIO AS A LEADER IN THE KNOWLEDGE WORLD OF ECONOMY AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT TAKES TO BRING ON DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY. HE'S BEEN REBUILDING OHIO SCHOOLS ENABLING CHILDREN TO SUCCEED, IMPROVING SERVICES FOR SENIORS AND RESTORING CITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. HIS OHIO READS PROGRAM ALONG WITH HOPE HAS RECRUITED MORE THAN 45,000 VOLUNTEER TUTORS TO HELP EVERY CHILD READ AT GRADE LEVEL BY THE END OF THE FOURTH GRADE. WHAT A WONDERFUL GOAL TO HAVE IN OHIO. HE AND FIRST LADY HOPE TAFT LEAD BY EXAMPLE TUTORING A COLUMBUS MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT WEEKLY. GOVERNOR BOB TAFT DOES LEAD BY EXAMPLE. HE HAS SET THAT EXAMPLE BY HIS HARD WORK AS A VICE CHAIRMAN OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND THIS YEAR WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE HE WAS AGREEABLE TO TAKING OVER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE RGA. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT, I'M PROUD TO PRESENT MY FRIEND AND YOUR FRIEND AND A GREAT SUPPORTER OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, GOVERNOR BOB TAFT OF THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. [ APPLAUSE ] >> YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS, I HAVE A WONDERFUL VICE CHAIRMAN, GOVERNOR KENNY GUINN OF NEVADA. LET'S HEAR IT FOR KENNY! THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY DINNER, A VERY SUCCESSFUL DINNER. MITT ROMNEY HAS DONE A SUPERB JOB. HE'S A LITTLE MODEST. DON'T KNOW IF MITT MENTIONED THE FACT TO YOU THAT TONIGHT WITH THIS DINNER, AN ALL-TIME RECORD, $7.3 MILLION. MITT ROMNEY! WOO! THANK YOU. STAND UP, MITT. STAND UP. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OTHER KEY RGA LEADERS WHO HAVE HELPED US OUT AND ARE HERE TONIGHT. FIRST, LET'S SALUTE MR. WAYNE BERMAN WHO WAS AWARDED THIS MORNING THE AWARD FOR EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE TO THE RGA. CONGRATULATIONS WAYNE BERMAN! I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE MR. JIM ROGERS WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SYNERGY, ONE OF OUR OUTSTANDING OHIO COMPANIES, A LONG-TIME FRIEND. HE HAS ACCEPTED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING RGA'S FINANCE CHAIRMAN FOR 2004. THANK YOU, JIM ROGERS. I ALSO WANT TO SALUTE ONE OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS, MR. ROGICH OF NEVADA FOR AGREEING TO STAY ON AS RGA FINANCE COACH THIS YEAR. WE APPRECIATE ALL YOU'RE DOING FOR RGA. AS CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO THANK EACH ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR GENEROUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT. YOU ARE HELPING TO ELECT MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATES. GOVERNORS WHO ARE HOLDING THE LINE ON SPENDING, STREAMLINING AND CREATING THE CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW BUSINESSES TO EXPAND AND CREATE NEW JOBS. YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE BEING WISELY INVESTED. WE WON THREE OUT OF FOUR RACES LAST YEAR, AND WE ARE GEARING UP FOR THIS YEAR'S ELECTIONS. WE HAVE 11 RACES. WE'RE DEFENDING FIVE REPUBLICAN SEATS AND WE'RE SEEKING TO GROW OUR MAJORITY IN OTHER KEY STATES. AND LET THERE BE NO DOUBT, THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US, ARE WORKING OVERTIME TO MAKE SURE THAT PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IS REELECTED PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER! [ APPLAUSE ] >> ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE INNOVATING AND WE ARE TRANSFORMING THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS'S ASSOCIATION INTO ONE OF THE MOST POTENT POLITICAL FORCES IN THE NATION. I WANT TO THANK MY PREDECESSOR, BILL OWENS. I WANT TO THANK OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ED TOBIN AND HIS TALENTED RGA STAFF. ESPECIALLY, I WANT TO THANK EACH ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WE ARE A GREAT TEAM. AND WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR WE CAN DO AGAIN IN 2004. SO THAT NEXT YEAR AMERICA'S MAJORITY CELEBRATION WILL BE EVEN BIGGER AND BETTER. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOW IF YOU ALL WOULD JUST BEAR WITH ME AND STAY PATIENT FOR A MOMENT, I WILL BE LEAVING THE STAGE AND SHORTLY I WILL BE RETURNING WITH A VERY, VERY SPECIAL GUEST. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS'S ASSOCIATION, GOVERNOR BOB TAFT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MISS LAURA BUSH [ APPLAUSE ] >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE LIVE IN HISTORIC AND CHANGING TIMES AND WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A LEADER IN THESE TIMES WHO IS BOTH STEADY AND STRONG. HE'S FOUGHT FOR PRO GROWTH POLICIES THAT ARE PUTTING AMERICANS BACK TO WORK. HE'S FOUGHT TO BRING HIGHER STANDARDS TO OUR SCHOOLS. SO THE STUDENTS OF AMERICA CAN GET THE EDUCATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. BUT ABOVE ALL, HE IS A LEADER WHO TAKES SERIOUSLY HIS CHARGE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND OUR NATION. WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE WITH US TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GEORGE W. BUSH AND FIRST LADY, LAURA BUSH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WELCOME, MR. PRESIDENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, ALL. THANK YOU, ALL, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. IT IS ALWAYS AN HONOR TO WELCOME FELLOW GOVERNORS TO WASHINGTON, D.C. I'M A PROUD FORMER MEMBER OF THE RGA. AND TONIGHT, WE'RE PROUD TO WELCOME THE NEWEST MEMBERS OF THE GROWING ORGANIZATION. OLENE, ERNIE, HALEY AND ARNOLD. THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA IS NEW TO POLITICS, SO HE'S STILL GETTING USED TO ALL THE CAMERAS AND LIGHTS. I USED TO THINK THE COOLEST GOVERNOR WAS FROM FLORIDA. MOST DISTINGUISHED FORMER MEMBER OF THE RGA IS A PREDECESSOR OF GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER, AND PREDECESSOR OF MINE. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN HAD HIS 93rd BIRTHDAY THIS MONTH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND TONIGHT WE WANT NANCY AND HIS FAMILY TO KNOW, WE ARE THINKING OF THIS GREAT AMERICAN. RONALD REAGAN'S LEADERSHIP REVIVED AMERICA'S ECONOMY, RENEWED AMERICA'S STRENGTH, AND LIFTED AMERICA'S CONFIDENCE. AND THAT SPIRIT OF OPTIMISM AND FAITH IN FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN VALUES IS THE SPIRIT WE WILL CARRY TO VICTORY IN NOVEMBER OF 2004. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I MARRIED REALLY WELL. I AM SO HONORED -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> I APPRECIATE YOU COMING TONIGHT, LAURA. SHE IS A GREAT FIRST LADY FOR OUR COUNTRY. REALLY PROUD OF THE JOB SHE'S DONE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND, BOB TAFT, FOR BEING THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS AUGUST GROUP. I APPRECIATE KENNY GUINN FROM NEVADA FOR BEING THE VICE CHAIRMAN. I THANK GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY FROM MASSACHUSETTS FOR HOSTING THIS RECEPTION. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE OTHER REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS WHO ARE HERE. I'M PROUD TO CALL YOU FRIEND. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF HOW ARE HERE TO SUPPORT THESE GOVERNORS. THEY'RE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR STATES. THEY BRING SUCH OPTIMISM AND HOPE. I APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS OF MY CABINET WHO ARE HERE. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A MAN WHO IS NOT HERE. VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY SPENT THE DAY CAMPAIGNING IN MINNEAPOLIS AND WICHITA. BUT HE'S RECENTLY COMPLETED ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT. ONCE AGAIN, I PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF MY VICE PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH COMMITTEE. HE TELLS ME HE'S REVIEWED ALL THE CANDIDATES, AND HE'S COME BACK WITH THE SAME RECOMMENDATION AS LAST TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> IN FACT, I MADE THE CHOICE MYSELF AFTER I HAD TAKEN THE MEASURE OF THIS MAN. THEY DON'T COME ANY BETTER. AND I AM PROUD TO HAVE DICK CHENEY BY MY SIDE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE MEET DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY SEASON. WE'RE WITNESSING A CLEAR TREND. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A WINNER IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. THE OTHER PARTY'S NOMINATION BATTLE IS STILL PLAYING OUT. CANDIDATES ARE AN INTERESTING GROUP WITH DIVERSE OPINIONS. FOR TAX CUTS, AND AGAINST THEM. FOR NAFTA, AND AGAINST NAFTA. FOR THE PATRIOT ACT, AND AGAINST THE PATRIOT ACT. IN FAVOR OF LIBERATING IRAQ, AND OPPOSED TO IT. THAT'S JUST ONE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE OTHER PARTY IS STILL NOT FINISHED SELECTING ITS NOMINEE. YET THIS MUCH IS ALREADY CERTAIN -- COME NOVEMBER, THE VOTERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR CHOICE. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN KEEPING THE TAX RELIEF THAT IS MOVING THE ECONOMY FORWARD, OR PUTTING THE BURDEN OF HIGHER TAXES BACK ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN AN AMERICA THAT LEADS THE WORLD WITH STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, OR AN AMERICA THAT IS UNCERTAIN IN THE FACE OF DANGER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DECIDE BETWEEN TWO VISIONS OF GOVERNMENT -- A GOVERNMENT THAT ENCOURAGES OWNERSHIP AND OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY, OR A GOVERNMENT THAT TAKES YOUR MONEY AND MAKES YOUR CHOICES. I WILL SET THESE ALTERNATIVES SQUARELY BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A SPIRITED CAMPAIGN. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTEST. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE HAVE A RECORD OF HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT. AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE HAVE A POSITIVE VISION FOR THE YEARS AHEAD. FOR WINNING THE WAR AGAINST TERROR, FOR EXTENDING PEACE AND FREEDOM, AND CREATING JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY HERE AT HOME. WE WILL LEAVE NO DOUBT WHERE WE STAND. AND WE WILL WIN OUR SECOND TERM IN NOVEMBER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BROUGHT SERIOUS CHALLENGES. WE'VE GIVEN SERIOUS ANSWERS, AND THE STRONG LEADERSHIP IN THESE TIMES OF EXTRA CHANGE DEMAND. WE CAME TO OFFICE WITH AN ECONOMY HEADING INTO RECESSION. WE DELIVERED HISTORIC TAX RELIEF. AND THE CONSUMER SPENDING AND INVESTMENT THAT RESULTED HELPED LIFT OUR ECONOMY BACK TO GROWTH SO THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING HIRED AGAIN. AT A TIME WHEN COMPETITION IS NOT JUST ACROSS TOWN, BUT ACROSS BORDERS AND CONTINENTS, AMERICA'S PRODUCTIVE WORKERS HAVE MADE THIS ECONOMY THE FASTEST GROWING OF ANY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE HAD TO CONFRONT CORPORATE CRIMES THAT COST PEOPLE JOBS AND SAVINGS. SO WE PASSED A STRONGEST CORPORATE REFORMS SINCE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT. AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE DISHONESTY IN THE BOARD ROOMS OF AMERICA. WE SAW WAR AND GRIEF ARRIVE ON A QUIET SEPTEMBER MORNING. AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS, WE HAVE PURSUED TERRORISTS ACROSS THE WORLD. WE'VE CAPTURED OR KILLED MANY OF THE KEY LEADERS OF THE AL QAEDA NETWORK, AND THE REST OF THEM KNOW WE'RE ON THEIR TRAIL. THERE IS NO CAVE OR HOLE DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE THEM. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE CONFRONTED THE DANGERS OF STATE-SPONSORED TERROR, AND THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WE HAVE USED THE POWER OF THIS COUNTRY TO END FOREVER TWO OF THE MOST VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS REGIMES ON EARTH. MORE THAN 50 MILLION PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN, AND IRAQ, ARE RECLAIMING THE RIGHTS AND DIGNITY OF FREE MEN AND WOMEN, AND AMERICA HAS BEEN PROUD, ONCE AGAIN, TO LEAD THE ARMIES OF LIBERATION. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WHEN DICK CHENEY AND I CAME TO WASHINGTON, WE FOUND A MILITARY THAT WAS UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERAPPRECIATED. SO WE INCREASED THE DEFENSE BUDGET TO GIVE OUR MEN AND WOMEN THE TOOLS AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO WIN THE WAR ON TERROR. TODAY, NO ONE IN THE WORLD CAN QUESTION THE SKILL, THE STRENGTH AND THE SPIRIT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> WE LEARNED THAT ON SEPTEMBER THE 11th, OUR HOMELAND IS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY VAST OCEANS. SO WE REORGANIZED OUR GOVERNMENT AND CREATED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO SAFEGUARD THE PORTS AND BORDERS AND TO BETTER PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN WE CAME TO OFFICE, PEOPLE IN THIS CITY HAD GOTTEN USED TO GRIDLOCK. OLD PROBLEMS WERE USED TO SCORE POINTS. OLD PROBLEMS WERE POLITICIZED, DEBATED, AND JUST PASSED ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR. WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO THIS NATION'S CAPITAL TO DO THINGS THE WASHINGTON WAY. WE CHOSE TO LEAD, AND TO GET THINGS DONE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE PASSED MAJOR REFORMS TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE PASSED REFORMS IN MEDICARE TO GIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND CHOICE TO OUR SENIORS. WE'RE SHOWING THAT WITH BIG GOALS, AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES, YOU CAN GET PAST OLD DIFFERENCES AND MAKE PROGRESS FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN CITIZENS. IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S JOB TO CONFRONT PROBLEMS, NOT TO PASS THEM ON TO FUTURE PRESIDENTS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S JOB TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES AND NOT LET THEM SLIP AWAY. THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO STEP UP AND MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS AND KEEP HIS COMMITMENTS, AND THAT IS HOW I WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> GREAT EVENTS WILL TURN ON THIS ELECTION. THE MAN WHO SITS IN THE OVAL OFFICE WILL SET THE COURSE OF THE WAR ON TERROR, AND THE DIRECTION OF OUR ECONOMY. THE SECURITY AND PROSPART OF AMERICA ARE AT STAKE. OUR COURSE IS CLEAR. THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WE'LL KEEP OUR ENEMIES ON THE RUN AND EXTEND THE FRONT TEARS OF LIBERTY. IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE'LL HELP MORE AMERICANS TO FIND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IN A CHANGING ECONOMY. IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL STAND FOR THE VALUES THAT MAKE US A GOOD AND DECENT COUNTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OUR OPPONENTS HAVE NOT OFFERED MUCH IN THE WAY OF STRATEGIES TO WIN THE WAR, OR POLICIES TO EXPAND OUR ECONOMY. SO FAR, ALL WE HEAR IS A LOT OF OLD BITTERNESS AND PARTISAN ANGER, ANGER IS NOT AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE OF AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE'RE TAKING ON THE BIG ISSUES WITH STRENGTH AND RESOLVE AND DETERMINATION AND WE STAND READY TO LEAD THIS NATION FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE BIG ISSUE FOR EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA IS THE FEDERAL TAX BURDEN, WITH THE LARGEST TAX RELIEF SINCE RONALD REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT, WE HAVE LEFT MORE MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO EARNED IT. BY SAVING AND SPENDING AND INVESTING AND TO HELP CREATE NEW JOBS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE USED THEIR MONEY FAR BETTER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OUR OPPONENTS HAVE THEIR OWN PLAN FOR THESE TAX CUTS. THEY PLAN TO TAKE THEM AWAY. THEY WOULD USE THAT MONEY TO EXPAND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GROWING, WE WILL HAVE FISCAL DISCIPLINE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GOING, THE TAX CUTS MUST BE PERMANENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE MUST DO MORE TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GROWING. WE NEED TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES FROM FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AND NEEDLESS REGULATION. WE NEED TO CONTROL THE COST OF HEALTH CARE BY PASSING MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM. NO ONE IS EVER BEEN HEALED BY A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE NEED TO PASS DOWN ENERGY LEGISLATION TO MODERNIZE OUR ELECTRICITY SYSTEM AND TO MAKE AMERICA LESS DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN SOURCES OF OIL. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OUR OPPONENTS TALK ABOUT JOB CREATION. BUT THEY'RE AGAINST EVERY ONE OF THESE JOB CREATING MEASURES. EMPTY TALK ABOUT JOBS WON'T GET ANYBODY HIRED. THE WAY TO CREATE JOBS IS OUR PRO GROWTH, PRO ENTREPRENEUR, PRO SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AGENDA. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THIS ECONOMY OF OURS IS GOING THROUGH A TIME OF CHALLENGE AND CHANGE. IN THE NEW ECONOMY, MANY WORKERS CHANGED JOBS SEVERAL TIMES. OR START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES, OR WORK OUT OF THEIR HOMES AS CONTRACTORS. THEY OFTEN DON'T HAVE PENSIONS, OR HEALTH CARE THROUGH THEIR JOBS. MANY HAVE HAD TO LEARN NEW SKILLS. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PEOPLE GAIN THE SKILLS AND SECURITY TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING, AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR RETIREMENT. ALL SKILLS START WITH EDUCATION. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT EDUCATION AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA. WE PASSED A NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT. [ APPLAUSE ] WE PASSED THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT, A GOOD LAW, THAT IS BRINGING HIGHER STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN AMERICA. WE HAVE A PLAN TO HELP HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO FALL BEHIND IN READING AND MATH. WE HAVE A PLAN TO HELP COMMUNITY COLLEGES TRAIN WORKERS FOR THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE CREATING THE MOST NEW JOBS. WE ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE EVERY ONE IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN AND TO SUCCEED AND TO REALIZE THE GREAT PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. MY ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF OWNERSHIP IN OUR SOCIETY. WE'VE SET A GREAT GOAL. WE WANT EVERY WORKER IN AMERICA TO BECOME A SABER AND AN OWNER AND WE HAVE AN AGENDA TO MEET THIS GOAL. WE WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE OF EVERY BACKGROUND TO OBSERVE THEIR OWN HOMES, AND BUILD THEIR OWN SAVINGS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESSES. WE WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE PLANS. WE WANT YOUNGER WORKERS TO OWN AND MANAGE THEIR OWN RETIREMENT UNDER SOCIAL SECURITY SO THAT ONE DAY EVERY WORKER CAN HAVE THE SECURITY OF A PERSONAL ACCOUNT. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SOLID ASSTOTS CALL THEIR OWN, THEY GAIN INDEPENDENCE, AND SECURITY, AND DIGNITY AND MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR FUTURE. WE BELIEVE IN PRIVATE PROPERTY SO MUCH, I WANT EVERYONE IN AMERICA TO HAVE SOME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE. OUR OPPONENTS ARE AGAINST THE PERSONAL ROO TIRMT ACCOUNTS. AGAINST PUTTING PATIENTS IN CHARGE OF MEDICARE. AGAINST TAX RELIEF. THEY SEEM TO BE AGAINST EVERY IDEA THAT IT GIVES AMERICANS MORE AUTHORITY AND MORE CHOICES AND MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN LIVES. WE'LL HEAR THEM MAKE A LOT OF PROMISES OVER THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS. AND LISTEN CLOSELY, BECAUSE THERE IS A THEME. EVERY PROMISE WILL INCREASE THE POWER OF POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS OVER YOUR INCOME, OVER YOUR RETIREMENT, OVER YOUR HEALTH CARE, AND OVER YOUR LIFE. IT'S THE SAME OLD WASHINGTON MINDSET. THEY'LL GIVE THE ORDERS, AND YOU'LL PAY THE BILLS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I'VE GOT NEWS FOR THEM. AMERICA HAS GONE BEYOND THAT WAY OF THINKING AND WE'RE NOT GOING BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> I TRUST THE PEOPLE. NOT WASHINGTON POLITICIANS, TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THEIR OWN MONEY, THEIR OWN HEALTH, THEIR OWN RETIREMENT, AND THEIR OWN LIVES. OUR FUTURE ALSO DEPENDS ON AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THIS WORLD. THE MOMENTUM OF FREEDOM IN OUR TIME IS STRONG, BUT WE STILL FACE SERIOUS CHALLENGES. AL QAEDA IS WOUNDED, BUT NOT BROKEN. TERRORISTS ARE TESTING OUR WILL IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. REGIMES IN NORTH KOREA AND IRAN ARE CHALLENGING THE PEACE. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE AND THE DECISIONS WE MAKE IN THIS DECADE WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES FAR INTO THIS CENTURY. IF AMERICA SHOWS WEAKNESS, AND UNCERTAINTY, THE WORLD WILL DRIFT TOWARD TRAGEDY. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THIS NATION IS STRONG AND CONFIDENT, AND -- IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM. AND NO FRIEND OR ENEMY TODAY DOUBTS THE WORD OF THE UNITED STATES. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AMERICAN ALLIES GAVE AN ULTIMATUM TO THE TERROR REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN. THE TALIBAN CHOSE DEFIANCE, AND THE TALIBAN ARE NO LONGER IN POWER. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES GAVE AN ULTIMATUM TO THE TERROR REGIME IN IRAQ. THE DICTATOR CHOSE DEFIANCE, AND NOW THE DICTATOR SITS IN A PRISON CELL. [ APPLAUSE ] >> SEPTEMBER THE 11th, 2001, TAUGHT A LESSON I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN. AMERICA MUST CONFRONT THREATS BEFORE THEY FULLY MATERIALIZE. IN IRAQ, MY ADMINISTRATION LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE, AND SAW A DANGER. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND THEY SAW A DANGER. THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND IT SAW A DANGER. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE, AND MADE REGIME CHANGE IN IRAQ THE POLICY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ALL KNEW SADDAM'S HISTORY WELL. HE WAGED AGGRESSIVE WARS AGAINST NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, AND INSPIRED TO DOMINATE THE MIDDLE EAST. HE CULTIVATED TIES TO TERRORISTS TERRORISTS. HE BUILT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. HE HID THOSE WEAPONS. HE USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS AND IRANIANS. IN 2002, THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, YET AGAIN, DEMANDED A FULL ACCOUNTING OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS PROGRAMS. AS HE HAD FOR OVER A DECADE, SADDAM HUSSEIN REFUSED TO COMPLY. SO WE HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE. EITHER TAKE THE WORD OF A MAD MAN, OR TAKE ACTION TO DEFEND AMERICA AND THE WORLD. FACED WITH THAT CHOICE, I WILL DEFEND AMERICA EVERY TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OTHERS WOULD HAVE CHOSEN DIFFERENTLY. THEY NOW AGREE THAT THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITH SADDAM OUT OF POWER. THEY JUST DIDN'T SUPPORT REMOVING SADDAM FROM POWER. MAYBE THEY WERE HOPING HE'D LOSE THE NEXT IRAQI ELECTION. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE SHOWED THE DICTATOR AND A WATCHING WORLD THAT WE SAY. BECAUSE OUR COALITION ACTED, SADDAM'S TORTURE CHAMBERS ARE CLOSED. BECAUSE WE ACTED, THE MIDDLE EAST IS MORE PEACEFUL. BECAUSE WE ACTED, IRAQ'S WEAPONS PROGRAMS ARE ENDED FOREVER. BECAUSE WE ACTED, NATIONS LIKE LIBYA HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE AND RENOUNCED THEIR WEAPONS PROGRAMS. BECAUSE WE ACTED, AN EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRACY IS RISING AT THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST. BECAUSE WE ACTED, THE WORLD IS MORE FREE AND AMERICA IS MORE SECURE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STILL FACE THUGS AND TERRORISTS IN IRAQ. WHO WOULD RATHER GO ON KILLING THE INNOCENT THAN ACCEPT THE ADVANCE OF LIBERTY. THEY KNOW THAT A FREE IRAQ WILL BE A MAJOR DEFEAT IN THE CAUSE OF TERROR. THIS COLLECTION OF KILLERS IS TRYING TO SHAKE THE WILL OF AMERICA AND THE CIVILIZED WORLD. THEY DON'T KNOW US VERY WELL. AMERICA WILL NEVER BE INTIMIDATED BY THUGS AND ASSASSINS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY STRIKING THE TERRORISTS IN IRAQ, DEFEATING THEM THERE SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO FACE THEM IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. WE'RE CALLING OTHER NATIONS TO HELP IRAQ BUILD A FREE SOCIETY WHICH WILL MAKE US ALL SAFER. WE'RE STANDING WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE AS THEY ASSUME MORE OF THEIR OWN DEFENSE AND MOVE TOWARDS SELF-GOVERNMENT. THESE AREN'T EASY TASKS. BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TASKS. WE WILL FINISH WHAT WE HAVE BEGUN, AND WE'LL WIN THIS IMPORTANT VICTORY AND WAR ON TERROR. [ APPLAUSE ] >> ON NATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICANS HAVE THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE CHOICE. OUR OPPONENTS SAY THEY'S PROVE OF BOLD ACTION IN THE WORLD, BUT ONLY IF NO OTHER GOVERNMENT DISAGREES. I'M ALL FOR UNITED ACTION. AND SO ARE THE 34 COALITION PARTNERS WE HAVE IN IRAQ RIGHT NOW. IN AMERICA, MUST NEVER OUTSOURCE AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY DECISIONS TO THE LEADERS OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> SOME OF OUR OPPONENTS ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE WAR ON TERROR IS REALLY A WAR AT ALL. THEY VIEW TERRORISM MORE AS A CRIME, A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INDICTMENTS. OUR NATION FOLLOWED THAT APPROACH AFTER THE WORLD TRADE CENTER WAS BOMBED IN 1993. THE MATTER WAS HANDLED IN THE COURTS AND THOUGHT TO BE SETTLED. THE TERRORISTS WERE STILL TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN, PLOTTING IN OTHER NATIONS AND DRAWING UP MORE AMBITIOUS PLANS. FOR THE CHAOS AND KARNAGE OF SEPTEMBER 11th, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SERVE OUR ENEMIES WITH LEGAL PAPERS. WITH THOSE ATTACKS, THE TERRORISTS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS DECLARED WAR ON THE UNITED STATES, AND WAR IS WHAT THEY GOT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING THIS WAR AND WHO HAVE SEEN THE ENEMY UNDERSTAND THE STAKES. LAST YEAR IN A LETTER HOME FROM THE IRAQI THEATER, A NAVY CORPSMAN NAMED LONNIE LEWIS WROTE THIS -- WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR -- LIFE, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THOSE RIGHTS, WE HAVE TO STOP THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. CORPSMAN LEWIS CONCLUDES, MY FAMILY IS FIRST, MY COUNTRY IS WHERE THEY LIVE, I WILL DEFEND IT. THIS IS THE CALIBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFENDING AMERICA. WE'RE COUNTING ON THEM. THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ AND THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST ARE DEPENDING ON THEM AND I ASSURE YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM IS IN GOOD HANDS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THIS NATION IS PROSPEROUS AND STRONG, YET WE NEED TO REMEMBER THE SOURCES OF AMERICA'S GREATNESS. WE'RE STRONG, BECAUSE WE LOVE FREEDOM. AMERICA HAS A SPECIAL CHARGE TO KEEP, BECAUSE WE ARE FREEDOM'S HOME AND DEFENDER. WE BELIEVE THAT FREEDOM IS THE DEEPEST NEED AND HOPE OF EVERY HUMAN HEART. WE BELIEVE THAT FREEDOM IS THE FUTURE OF EVERY NATION, AND WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM IS NOT AMERICA'S GIFT TO THE WORLD, IT IS THE ALL MIGHTY GOD'S GIFT TO EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS WORLD. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GREATEST STRENGTH OF THIS COUNTRY LIES IN THE HEARTS AND SOULS OF OUR CITIZENS. WE'RE STRONG BECAUSE OF THE VALUES WE TRY TO LIVE BY, COURAGE AND COMPASSION, REVERENCE AND INTEGRITY. WE'RE STRONG BECAUSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT HELP TO GIVE US DIRECTION AND PURPOSE, FAMILIES, AND SCHOOLS, AND RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS. THESE VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR LIVES. AND THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT OF OUR GOVERNMENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STAND FOR THE FAIR TREATMENT OF FAITH-BASED GROUPS SO THEY CAN RECEIVE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THEIR WORKS OF COMPASSION AND HEALING. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR GOVERNMENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE OF FAITH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STAND FOR WELFARE REFORMS THAT REQUIRE WORK AND STRENGTHEN MARRIAGE WHICH HAVE HELPED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FIND INDEPENDENCE AND DIGNITY. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR ANY ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN THOSE REFORMS AND SEND PEOPLE BACK INTO LIVES OF DEPENDENCE. WE STAND FOR THE CULTURE OF LIFE IN WHICH EVERY PERSON COUNTS, AND EVERY PERSON MATTERS. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANY LIFE AS A COMMODITY TO BE EXPERIMENTED UPON OR EXPLOITED OR CLONED. WE STAND FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGES WHO STRICTLY AND FAITHFULLY INTERPRET THE LAW. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR JUDGES WHO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY BY LEGISLATING FROM THE BENCH, AND TRY TO REMAKE THE CULTURE BY COURT ORDER. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STAND FOR A CULTURE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN AMERICA. WE'RE CHANGING THE CULTURE OF AMERICA FROM ONE THAT HAS SAID IF IT FEELS GOOD, DO IT. IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM, BLAME SOMEBODY ELSE, TO A CULTURE IN WHICH EACH OF US UNDERSTANDS WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECISIONS WE MAKE. IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE A MOTHER OR A FATHER, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOVING YOUR CHILD WITH ALL YOUR HEART. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU LIVE, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IF YOU'RE A CEO IN AMERICA, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING THE TRUTH TO YOUR SHAREHOLDERS AND YOUR EMPLOYEES. AND IN THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY SOCIETY, EACH OF US IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOVING OUR NEIGHBOR, JUST LIKE WE'D LIKE TO BE LOVED OURSELF. [ APPLAUSE ] >> FOR ALL AMERICANS, THESE YEARS IN OUR HISTORY WILL ALWAYS STAND APART. THERE ARE QUIET TIMES IN THE LIFE OF A NATION, WHEN LITTLE IS EXPECTED OF OUR LEADERS. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES. YOU AND I ARE LIVING IN A PERIOD WHEN THE STAKES ARE HIGH, AND THE CHA CHALLENGES ARE DIFFICULT THE CHOICES ARE CLEAR, AND RESOLVE IS NEEDED. NONE OF US WILL EVER FORGET THAT WEEK WHEN ONE ERA ENDED AND ANOTHER BEGAN. SEPTEMBER THE 14th, 2001. I STOOD IN THE RUINS OF THE TWIN TOWERS. I REMEMBER A LOT THAT DAY. WORKERS IN HARDHATS WERE SHOUTING, ""WHATEVER IT TAKES."" ONE FELLOW POINTED AT ME AND SAID, ""DON'T LET ME DOWN."" AS WE ALL DID THAT DAY, THESE MEN AND WOMEN SEARCHING THROUGH THE RUBBLE TOOK IT PERSONALLY. I TOOK IT PERSONALLY. I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT GOES ON. I WILL NEVER RELENT IN BRINGING JUSTICE TO OUR ENEMIES. I WILL DEFEND AMERICA, WHATEVER IT TAKES. [ APPLAUSE ] >> IN THESE TIMES, I'VE ALSO BEEN WITNESS TO THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. NOT SO LONG AGO SOME HAD THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT THE AMERICAN CHARACTER, OUR CAPACITY TO MEET SERIOUS CHALLENGES. TO SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF-INTEREST. BUT AMERICANS HAVE GIVEN THEIR ANSWER. I'VE SEEN THE UNSELFISH COURAGE OF OUR TROOPS. I'VE SEEN THE HEROISM OF AMERICANS IN THE FACE OF DANGER. I'VE SEEN THE SPIRIT OF SERVICE AND COMPASSION RENEWED IN OUR COUNTRY. WE'VE ALL SEEN OUR NATION UNITE IN COMMON PURPOSE WHEN IT MATTERED MOST. WE WILL WANT ALL OF THESE QUALITIES FOR THE WORK AHEAD. WE HAVE A WAR TO WIN. AND THE WORLD IS COUNTING ON US TO LEAD THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM. WE HAVE A DUTY TO SPREAD COMPASSION AND OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY PART OF AMERICA. THIS IS THE WORK THAT HISTORY HAS SET BEFORE US. WE WELCOME IT. AND WE KNOW THAT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE BEST DAYS LIE AHEAD. GOD BLESS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU ALL. >>",2015-11-07 17:31:15,2004-02-23,Washington,District of Columbia

BUT WILL ROGERS SAID THAT HE DOESN'T MAKE JOKES, HE JUST GOES TO WASHINGTON, OBSERVES GOVERNMENT, AND REPORTS THE FACTS, AND SO I WENT TODAY TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE HUMOR TO A WEBSITE. I WENT TO A WEBSITE OF ONE OF THE PEEMT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. IT HAD A VERY IMPORTANT TITLE, SAID REVIVING AMERICAN MANUFACTURING. I SAID THAT'S IMPORTANT. THAT'S SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO. LET'S SEE WHAT THIS CANDIDATE HAS TO SAY. I COULDN'T WRITE THIS FUNNIER IF I WERE TRYING. IT MENTIONS THE CANDIDATE WILL SAVE JOBS BY ENDING THE UNPATRIOTIC PRACTICE OF U.S. CORPORATIONS MOVING OFFSHORE SIMPLY TO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF OUR NATION'S TAX BURDEN. THE NEXT SENTENCE, TO CREATE NEW JOBS, THIS SENATOR WILL PROVIDE NEW TAX BREAKS TO MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCE GOODS AND CREATE JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES. NOW IF THAT'S NOT COMING DOWN ON BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT. WHAT I'M PLEASED TO DO IS TO STAND HERE WITH THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND WITH YOU WHO CARE ABOUT AMERICA'S MAJORITY, AND TO STAND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR SOMETHING. WHO WE KNOW EXACTLY AND PRECISELY WHERE HE STANDS. I'M PROUD TO STAND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR WINNING THE WAR AGAINST TERROR, FOR A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR BRINGING ACCOUNTABILITY INTO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND MAKING THEM THE KIND OF SCHOOLS THAT GIVE KIDS A FUTURE THEY NEED, THE KIND OF PRESIDENT WHO STANDS FOR PROVIDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO OUR SENIORS. FINALLY, TO THE KIND OF PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT EVERY DAY FOR GOOD JOBS FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY. I'M PROUD, LIKE ALL THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, TO STAND WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GEORGE BUSH. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THERE IS ONE MORE PERSON I WANT TO HAVE STAND, AND THAT'S THE GREAT GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEVADA. KENNY GLEN, YOU KNOW THIS MAN. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN. HE WAS A TEACHER, A SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT, HE'S AN EDUCATION GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR, COME TAKE IT AWAY. VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS' ASSOCIATION. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE EFFORTS IN HELPING THE RGA SET UP A FANTASTIC RECORD IN FUND RAISING FOR ALL OF OUR FUTURE CANDIDATES AND ESPECIALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GEORGE W. BUSH. I'M PROUD, VERY PROUD, TO AND PART OF THIS FINE ORGANIZATION. THESE GOVERNORS ARE VERY TALENTED. IT'S A GROUP OF MANAGERS AND VISIONARIES. I'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL BY BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THEY'RE A FORMER CONGRESSMAN, SENATOR, STATE LEGISLATURES, BEARS AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. LAST YEAR WE WERE AGGRESSIVELY INVOLVED IN THE GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGNS AND BECAUSE OF OUR EFFORTS WITH YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR MIGHTY SUPPORT, WE WERE ABLE TO ELECT THESE THREE GREAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND ALMOST ATTAIN THE ELECTION OF THE FOURTH ONE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AGGRESSIVE THIS YEAR, BUT WE WILL SHEPHERD OUR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THE HARD-EARNED DOLLARS THAT YOU CONTRIBUTE ARE USED TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS AND THE 11 RACES THAT WE'LL BE FACING FOR GUBERNATORIAL POSITIONS IN THE YEAR 2004. I WANT TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO THANK YOU, THE SUPPORTERS OF RGA. NOT ONLY DO WE THANK YOU FOR THE DOLLARS YOU CONTRIBUTE TO HELP ELECT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, WE ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE WISDOM AND THE COUNSEL THAT YOU GIVE US. THIS ROOM IS FILLED WITH ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE, INDIVIDUALS, THAT HAVE GREAT IDEAS AND GREAT THOUGHTS AND GREAT ADVICE FOR US. MANY OF YOU GAVE ME SOME OF THAT AS I WALKED THROUGH THE CROWD TONIGHT. AND I TRULY APPRECIATE IT. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU HAS SOME GOOD IDEAS AND IT'S OUR JOB NOT TO ALWAYS COME UP WITH THE IDEAS. IT'S OUR JOB TO RECOGNIZE GOOD IDEAS FROM THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE ALL ACROSS THIS GREAT LAND. EACH OF YOU CAN OFFER IDEAS ON IMPROVING HEALTH CARE AND MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT. AND PROVIDING FOR MORE RELIABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY. YOU ARE GREAT AMERICANS WHO DON'T JUST SIT ON THE SIDE. YOU GET INVOLVED. AND THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS DEMOCRACY AND FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE WELL BEING OF OUR STATES. YOU PLAY A VITAL ROLE. IT IS MY PLEASURE TONIGHT TO INTRODUCE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION BOB TAFT OF OHIO. YOUR FRIEND AND MY FRIEND. [ APPLAUSE ] >> GOVERNOR TAFT BEGAN HIS CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE AS VOLUNTEER FOR THE PEACE CORPS IN EAST AFRICA. HE HAS SERVED OHIO AS A MEMBER OF THE OHIO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AS A HAMILTON COUNTY COMMISSIONER, AND AS OHIO'S SECRETARY OF STATE. SINCE BEING SWORN IN AS OHIO'S 67th GOVERNOR, IN 1999, GOVERNOR TAFT HAS FOCUSED ON ATTRACTING HIGH-PAYING JOBS TO THE STATE OF OHIO. HE'S BEEN POSITIONING OHIO AS A LEADER IN THE KNOWLEDGE WORLD OF ECONOMY AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT TAKES TO BRING ON DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY. HE'S BEEN REBUILDING OHIO SCHOOLS ENABLING CHILDREN TO SUCCEED, IMPROVING SERVICES FOR SENIORS AND RESTORING CITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. HIS OHIO READS PROGRAM ALONG WITH HOPE HAS RECRUITED MORE THAN 45,000 VOLUNTEER TUTORS TO HELP EVERY CHILD READ AT GRADE LEVEL BY THE END OF THE FOURTH GRADE. WHAT A WONDERFUL GOAL TO HAVE IN OHIO. HE AND FIRST LADY HOPE TAFT LEAD BY EXAMPLE TUTORING A COLUMBUS MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT WEEKLY. GOVERNOR BOB TAFT DOES LEAD BY EXAMPLE. HE HAS SET THAT EXAMPLE BY HIS HARD WORK AS A VICE CHAIRMAN OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND THIS YEAR WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE HE WAS AGREEABLE TO TAKING OVER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE RGA. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT, I'M PROUD TO PRESENT MY FRIEND AND YOUR FRIEND AND A GREAT SUPPORTER OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, GOVERNOR BOB TAFT OF THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. [ APPLAUSE ] >> YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS, I HAVE A WONDERFUL VICE CHAIRMAN, GOVERNOR KENNY GUINN OF NEVADA. LET'S HEAR IT FOR KENNY! THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY DINNER, A VERY SUCCESSFUL DINNER. MITT ROMNEY HAS DONE A SUPERB JOB. HE'S A LITTLE MODEST. DON'T KNOW IF MITT MENTIONED THE FACT TO YOU THAT TONIGHT WITH THIS DINNER, AN ALL-TIME RECORD, $7.3 MILLION. MITT ROMNEY! WOO! THANK YOU. STAND UP, MITT. STAND UP. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OTHER KEY RGA LEADERS WHO HAVE HELPED US OUT AND ARE HERE TONIGHT. FIRST, LET'S SALUTE MR. WAYNE BERMAN WHO WAS AWARDED THIS MORNING THE AWARD FOR EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE TO THE RGA. CONGRATULATIONS WAYNE BERMAN! I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE MR. JIM ROGERS WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SYNERGY, ONE OF OUR OUTSTANDING OHIO COMPANIES, A LONG-TIME FRIEND. HE HAS ACCEPTED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING RGA'S FINANCE CHAIRMAN FOR 2004. THANK YOU, JIM ROGERS. I ALSO WANT TO SALUTE ONE OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS, MR. ROGICH OF NEVADA FOR AGREEING TO STAY ON AS RGA FINANCE COACH THIS YEAR. WE APPRECIATE ALL YOU'RE DOING FOR RGA. AS CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO THANK EACH ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR GENEROUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT. YOU ARE HELPING TO ELECT MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATES. GOVERNORS WHO ARE HOLDING THE LINE ON SPENDING, STREAMLINING AND CREATING THE CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW BUSINESSES TO EXPAND AND CREATE NEW JOBS. YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE BEING WISELY INVESTED. WE WON THREE OUT OF FOUR RACES LAST YEAR, AND WE ARE GEARING UP FOR THIS YEAR'S ELECTIONS. WE HAVE 11 RACES. WE'RE DEFENDING FIVE REPUBLICAN SEATS AND WE'RE SEEKING TO GROW OUR MAJORITY IN OTHER KEY STATES. AND LET THERE BE NO DOUBT, THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US, ARE WORKING OVERTIME TO MAKE SURE THAT PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IS REELECTED PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER! [ APPLAUSE ] >> ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE INNOVATING AND WE ARE TRANSFORMING THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS'S ASSOCIATION INTO ONE OF THE MOST POTENT POLITICAL FORCES IN THE NATION. I WANT TO THANK MY PREDECESSOR, BILL OWENS. I WANT TO THANK OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ED TOBIN AND HIS TALENTED RGA STAFF. ESPECIALLY, I WANT TO THANK EACH ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WE ARE A GREAT TEAM. AND WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR WE CAN DO AGAIN IN 2004. SO THAT NEXT YEAR AMERICA'S MAJORITY CELEBRATION WILL BE EVEN BIGGER AND BETTER. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOW IF YOU ALL WOULD JUST BEAR WITH ME AND STAY PATIENT FOR A MOMENT, I WILL BE LEAVING THE STAGE AND SHORTLY I WILL BE RETURNING WITH A VERY, VERY SPECIAL GUEST. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS'S ASSOCIATION, GOVERNOR BOB TAFT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MISS LAURA BUSH [ APPLAUSE ] >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE LIVE IN HISTORIC AND CHANGING TIMES AND WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A LEADER IN THESE TIMES WHO IS BOTH STEADY AND STRONG. HE'S FOUGHT FOR PRO GROWTH POLICIES THAT ARE PUTTING AMERICANS BACK TO WORK. HE'S FOUGHT TO BRING HIGHER STANDARDS TO OUR SCHOOLS. SO THE STUDENTS OF AMERICA CAN GET THE EDUCATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. BUT ABOVE ALL, HE IS A LEADER WHO TAKES SERIOUSLY HIS CHARGE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND OUR NATION. WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE WITH US TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GEORGE W. BUSH AND FIRST LADY, LAURA BUSH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WELCOME, MR. PRESIDENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, ALL. THANK YOU, ALL, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. IT IS ALWAYS AN HONOR TO WELCOME FELLOW GOVERNORS TO WASHINGTON, D.C. I'M A PROUD FORMER MEMBER OF THE RGA. AND TONIGHT, WE'RE PROUD TO WELCOME THE NEWEST MEMBERS OF THE GROWING ORGANIZATION. OLENE, ERNIE, HALEY AND ARNOLD. THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA IS NEW TO POLITICS, SO HE'S STILL GETTING USED TO ALL THE CAMERAS AND LIGHTS. I USED TO THINK THE COOLEST GOVERNOR WAS FROM FLORIDA. MOST DISTINGUISHED FORMER MEMBER OF THE RGA IS A PREDECESSOR OF GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER, AND PREDECESSOR OF MINE. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN HAD HIS 93rd BIRTHDAY THIS MONTH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND TONIGHT WE WANT NANCY AND HIS FAMILY TO KNOW, WE ARE THINKING OF THIS GREAT AMERICAN. RONALD REAGAN'S LEADERSHIP REVIVED AMERICA'S ECONOMY, RENEWED AMERICA'S STRENGTH, AND LIFTED AMERICA'S CONFIDENCE. AND THAT SPIRIT OF OPTIMISM AND FAITH IN FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN VALUES IS THE SPIRIT WE WILL CARRY TO VICTORY IN NOVEMBER OF 2004. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I MARRIED REALLY WELL. I AM SO HONORED -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> I APPRECIATE YOU COMING TONIGHT, LAURA. SHE IS A GREAT FIRST LADY FOR OUR COUNTRY. REALLY PROUD OF THE JOB SHE'S DONE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND, BOB TAFT, FOR BEING THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS AUGUST GROUP. I APPRECIATE KENNY GUINN FROM NEVADA FOR BEING THE VICE CHAIRMAN. I THANK GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY FROM MASSACHUSETTS FOR HOSTING THIS RECEPTION. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE OTHER REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS WHO ARE HERE. I'M PROUD TO CALL YOU FRIEND. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF HOW ARE HERE TO SUPPORT THESE GOVERNORS. THEY'RE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR STATES. THEY BRING SUCH OPTIMISM AND HOPE. I APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS OF MY CABINET WHO ARE HERE. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A MAN WHO IS NOT HERE. VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY SPENT THE DAY CAMPAIGNING IN MINNEAPOLIS AND WICHITA. BUT HE'S RECENTLY COMPLETED ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT. ONCE AGAIN, I PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF MY VICE PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH COMMITTEE. HE TELLS ME HE'S REVIEWED ALL THE CANDIDATES, AND HE'S COME BACK WITH THE SAME RECOMMENDATION AS LAST TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> IN FACT, I MADE THE CHOICE MYSELF AFTER I HAD TAKEN THE MEASURE OF THIS MAN. THEY DON'T COME ANY BETTER. AND I AM PROUD TO HAVE DICK CHENEY BY MY SIDE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE MEET DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY SEASON. WE'RE WITNESSING A CLEAR TREND. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A WINNER IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. THE OTHER PARTY'S NOMINATION BATTLE IS STILL PLAYING OUT. CANDIDATES ARE AN INTERESTING GROUP WITH DIVERSE OPINIONS. FOR TAX CUTS, AND AGAINST THEM. FOR NAFTA, AND AGAINST NAFTA. FOR THE PATRIOT ACT, AND AGAINST THE PATRIOT ACT. IN FAVOR OF LIBERATING IRAQ, AND OPPOSED TO IT. THAT'S JUST ONE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE OTHER PARTY IS STILL NOT FINISHED SELECTING ITS NOMINEE. YET THIS MUCH IS ALREADY CERTAIN -- COME NOVEMBER, THE VOTERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR CHOICE. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN KEEPING THE TAX RELIEF THAT IS MOVING THE ECONOMY FORWARD, OR PUTTING THE BURDEN OF HIGHER TAXES BACK ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN AN AMERICA THAT LEADS THE WORLD WITH STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, OR AN AMERICA THAT IS UNCERTAIN IN THE FACE OF DANGER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DECIDE BETWEEN TWO VISIONS OF GOVERNMENT -- A GOVERNMENT THAT ENCOURAGES OWNERSHIP AND OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY, OR A GOVERNMENT THAT TAKES YOUR MONEY AND MAKES YOUR CHOICES. I WILL SET THESE ALTERNATIVES SQUARELY BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A SPIRITED CAMPAIGN. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTEST. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE HAVE A RECORD OF HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT. AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE HAVE A POSITIVE VISION FOR THE YEARS AHEAD. FOR WINNING THE WAR AGAINST TERROR, FOR EXTENDING PEACE AND FREEDOM, AND CREATING JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY HERE AT HOME. WE WILL LEAVE NO DOUBT WHERE WE STAND. AND WE WILL WIN OUR SECOND TERM IN NOVEMBER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BROUGHT SERIOUS CHALLENGES. WE'VE GIVEN SERIOUS ANSWERS, AND THE STRONG LEADERSHIP IN THESE TIMES OF EXTRA CHANGE DEMAND. WE CAME TO OFFICE WITH AN ECONOMY HEADING INTO RECESSION. WE DELIVERED HISTORIC TAX RELIEF. AND THE CONSUMER SPENDING AND INVESTMENT THAT RESULTED HELPED LIFT OUR ECONOMY BACK TO GROWTH SO THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING HIRED AGAIN. AT A TIME WHEN COMPETITION IS NOT JUST ACROSS TOWN, BUT ACROSS BORDERS AND CONTINENTS, AMERICA'S PRODUCTIVE WORKERS HAVE MADE THIS ECONOMY THE FASTEST GROWING OF ANY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE HAD TO CONFRONT CORPORATE CRIMES THAT COST PEOPLE JOBS AND SAVINGS. SO WE PASSED A STRONGEST CORPORATE REFORMS SINCE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT. AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE DISHONESTY IN THE BOARD ROOMS OF AMERICA. WE SAW WAR AND GRIEF ARRIVE ON A QUIET SEPTEMBER MORNING. AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS, WE HAVE PURSUED TERRORISTS ACROSS THE WORLD. WE'VE CAPTURED OR KILLED MANY OF THE KEY LEADERS OF THE AL QAEDA NETWORK, AND THE REST OF THEM KNOW WE'RE ON THEIR TRAIL. THERE IS NO CAVE OR HOLE DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE THEM. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE CONFRONTED THE DANGERS OF STATE-SPONSORED TERROR, AND THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WE HAVE USED THE POWER OF THIS COUNTRY TO END FOREVER TWO OF THE MOST VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS REGIMES ON EARTH. MORE THAN 50 MILLION PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN, AND IRAQ, ARE RECLAIMING THE RIGHTS AND DIGNITY OF FREE MEN AND WOMEN, AND AMERICA HAS BEEN PROUD, ONCE AGAIN, TO LEAD THE ARMIES OF LIBERATION. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WHEN DICK CHENEY AND I CAME TO WASHINGTON, WE FOUND A MILITARY THAT WAS UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERAPPRECIATED. SO WE INCREASED THE DEFENSE BUDGET TO GIVE OUR MEN AND WOMEN THE TOOLS AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO WIN THE WAR ON TERROR. TODAY, NO ONE IN THE WORLD CAN QUESTION THE SKILL, THE STRENGTH AND THE SPIRIT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> WE LEARNED THAT ON SEPTEMBER THE 11th, OUR HOMELAND IS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY VAST OCEANS. SO WE REORGANIZED OUR GOVERNMENT AND CREATED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO SAFEGUARD THE PORTS AND BORDERS AND TO BETTER PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN WE CAME TO OFFICE, PEOPLE IN THIS CITY HAD GOTTEN USED TO GRIDLOCK. OLD PROBLEMS WERE USED TO SCORE POINTS. OLD PROBLEMS WERE POLITICIZED, DEBATED, AND JUST PASSED ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR. WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO THIS NATION'S CAPITAL TO DO THINGS THE WASHINGTON WAY. WE CHOSE TO LEAD, AND TO GET THINGS DONE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE PASSED MAJOR REFORMS TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE PASSED REFORMS IN MEDICARE TO GIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND CHOICE TO OUR SENIORS. WE'RE SHOWING THAT WITH BIG GOALS, AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES, YOU CAN GET PAST OLD DIFFERENCES AND MAKE PROGRESS FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN CITIZENS. IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S JOB TO CONFRONT PROBLEMS, NOT TO PASS THEM ON TO FUTURE PRESIDENTS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S JOB TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES AND NOT LET THEM SLIP AWAY. THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO STEP UP AND MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS AND KEEP HIS COMMITMENTS, AND THAT IS HOW I WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> GREAT EVENTS WILL TURN ON THIS ELECTION. THE MAN WHO SITS IN THE OVAL OFFICE WILL SET THE COURSE OF THE WAR ON TERROR, AND THE DIRECTION OF OUR ECONOMY. THE SECURITY AND PROSPART OF AMERICA ARE AT STAKE. OUR COURSE IS CLEAR. THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WE'LL KEEP OUR ENEMIES ON THE RUN AND EXTEND THE FRONT TEARS OF LIBERTY. IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE'LL HELP MORE AMERICANS TO FIND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IN A CHANGING ECONOMY. IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL STAND FOR THE VALUES THAT MAKE US A GOOD AND DECENT COUNTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OUR OPPONENTS HAVE NOT OFFERED MUCH IN THE WAY OF STRATEGIES TO WIN THE WAR, OR POLICIES TO EXPAND OUR ECONOMY. SO FAR, ALL WE HEAR IS A LOT OF OLD BITTERNESS AND PARTISAN ANGER, ANGER IS NOT AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE OF AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE'RE TAKING ON THE BIG ISSUES WITH STRENGTH AND RESOLVE AND DETERMINATION AND WE STAND READY TO LEAD THIS NATION FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE BIG ISSUE FOR EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA IS THE FEDERAL TAX BURDEN, WITH THE LARGEST TAX RELIEF SINCE RONALD REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT, WE HAVE LEFT MORE MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO EARNED IT. BY SAVING AND SPENDING AND INVESTING AND TO HELP CREATE NEW JOBS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE USED THEIR MONEY FAR BETTER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OUR OPPONENTS HAVE THEIR OWN PLAN FOR THESE TAX CUTS. THEY PLAN TO TAKE THEM AWAY. THEY WOULD USE THAT MONEY TO EXPAND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GROWING, WE WILL HAVE FISCAL DISCIPLINE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GOING, THE TAX CUTS MUST BE PERMANENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE MUST DO MORE TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GROWING. WE NEED TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES FROM FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AND NEEDLESS REGULATION. WE NEED TO CONTROL THE COST OF HEALTH CARE BY PASSING MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM. NO ONE IS EVER BEEN HEALED BY A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE NEED TO PASS DOWN ENERGY LEGISLATION TO MODERNIZE OUR ELECTRICITY SYSTEM AND TO MAKE AMERICA LESS DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN SOURCES OF OIL. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OUR OPPONENTS TALK ABOUT JOB CREATION. BUT THEY'RE AGAINST EVERY ONE OF THESE JOB CREATING MEASURES. EMPTY TALK ABOUT JOBS WON'T GET ANYBODY HIRED. THE WAY TO CREATE JOBS IS OUR PRO GROWTH, PRO ENTREPRENEUR, PRO SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AGENDA. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THIS ECONOMY OF OURS IS GOING THROUGH A TIME OF CHALLENGE AND CHANGE. IN THE NEW ECONOMY, MANY WORKERS CHANGED JOBS SEVERAL TIMES. OR START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES, OR WORK OUT OF THEIR HOMES AS CONTRACTORS. THEY OFTEN DON'T HAVE PENSIONS, OR HEALTH CARE THROUGH THEIR JOBS. MANY HAVE HAD TO LEARN NEW SKILLS. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PEOPLE GAIN THE SKILLS AND SECURITY TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING, AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR RETIREMENT. ALL SKILLS START WITH EDUCATION. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT EDUCATION AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA. WE PASSED A NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT. [ APPLAUSE ] WE PASSED THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT, A GOOD LAW, THAT IS BRINGING HIGHER STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN AMERICA. WE HAVE A PLAN TO HELP HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO FALL BEHIND IN READING AND MATH. WE HAVE A PLAN TO HELP COMMUNITY COLLEGES TRAIN WORKERS FOR THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE CREATING THE MOST NEW JOBS. WE ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE EVERY ONE IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN AND TO SUCCEED AND TO REALIZE THE GREAT PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. MY ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF OWNERSHIP IN OUR SOCIETY. WE'VE SET A GREAT GOAL. WE WANT EVERY WORKER IN AMERICA TO BECOME A SABER AND AN OWNER AND WE HAVE AN AGENDA TO MEET THIS GOAL. WE WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE OF EVERY BACKGROUND TO OBSERVE THEIR OWN HOMES, AND BUILD THEIR OWN SAVINGS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESSES. WE WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE PLANS. WE WANT YOUNGER WORKERS TO OWN AND MANAGE THEIR OWN RETIREMENT UNDER SOCIAL SECURITY SO THAT ONE DAY EVERY WORKER CAN HAVE THE SECURITY OF A PERSONAL ACCOUNT. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SOLID ASSTOTS CALL THEIR OWN, THEY GAIN INDEPENDENCE, AND SECURITY, AND DIGNITY AND MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR FUTURE. WE BELIEVE IN PRIVATE PROPERTY SO MUCH, I WANT EVERYONE IN AMERICA TO HAVE SOME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE. OUR OPPONENTS ARE AGAINST THE PERSONAL ROO TIRMT ACCOUNTS. AGAINST PUTTING PATIENTS IN CHARGE OF MEDICARE. AGAINST TAX RELIEF. THEY SEEM TO BE AGAINST EVERY IDEA THAT IT GIVES AMERICANS MORE AUTHORITY AND MORE CHOICES AND MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN LIVES. WE'LL HEAR THEM MAKE A LOT OF PROMISES OVER THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS. AND LISTEN CLOSELY, BECAUSE THERE IS A THEME. EVERY PROMISE WILL INCREASE THE POWER OF POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS OVER YOUR INCOME, OVER YOUR RETIREMENT, OVER YOUR HEALTH CARE, AND OVER YOUR LIFE. IT'S THE SAME OLD WASHINGTON MINDSET. THEY'LL GIVE THE ORDERS, AND YOU'LL PAY THE BILLS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I'VE GOT NEWS FOR THEM. AMERICA HAS GONE BEYOND THAT WAY OF THINKING AND WE'RE NOT GOING BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> I TRUST THE PEOPLE. NOT WASHINGTON POLITICIANS, TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THEIR OWN MONEY, THEIR OWN HEALTH, THEIR OWN RETIREMENT, AND THEIR OWN LIVES. OUR FUTURE ALSO DEPENDS ON AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THIS WORLD. THE MOMENTUM OF FREEDOM IN OUR TIME IS STRONG, BUT WE STILL FACE SERIOUS CHALLENGES. AL QAEDA IS WOUNDED, BUT NOT BROKEN. TERRORISTS ARE TESTING OUR WILL IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. REGIMES IN NORTH KOREA AND IRAN ARE CHALLENGING THE PEACE. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE AND THE DECISIONS WE MAKE IN THIS DECADE WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES FAR INTO THIS CENTURY. IF AMERICA SHOWS WEAKNESS, AND UNCERTAINTY, THE WORLD WILL DRIFT TOWARD TRAGEDY. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THIS NATION IS STRONG AND CONFIDENT, AND -- IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM. AND NO FRIEND OR ENEMY TODAY DOUBTS THE WORD OF THE UNITED STATES. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AMERICAN ALLIES GAVE AN ULTIMATUM TO THE TERROR REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN. THE TALIBAN CHOSE DEFIANCE, AND THE TALIBAN ARE NO LONGER IN POWER. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES GAVE AN ULTIMATUM TO THE TERROR REGIME IN IRAQ. THE DICTATOR CHOSE DEFIANCE, AND NOW THE DICTATOR SITS IN A PRISON CELL. [ APPLAUSE ] >> SEPTEMBER THE 11th, 2001, TAUGHT A LESSON I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN. AMERICA MUST CONFRONT THREATS BEFORE THEY FULLY MATERIALIZE. IN IRAQ, MY ADMINISTRATION LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE, AND SAW A DANGER. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND THEY SAW A DANGER. THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND IT SAW A DANGER. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE, AND MADE REGIME CHANGE IN IRAQ THE POLICY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ALL KNEW SADDAM'S HISTORY WELL. HE WAGED AGGRESSIVE WARS AGAINST NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, AND INSPIRED TO DOMINATE THE MIDDLE EAST. HE CULTIVATED TIES TO TERRORISTS TERRORISTS. HE BUILT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. HE HID THOSE WEAPONS. HE USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS AND IRANIANS. IN 2002, THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, YET AGAIN, DEMANDED A FULL ACCOUNTING OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS PROGRAMS. AS HE HAD FOR OVER A DECADE, SADDAM HUSSEIN REFUSED TO COMPLY. SO WE HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE. EITHER TAKE THE WORD OF A MAD MAN, OR TAKE ACTION TO DEFEND AMERICA AND THE WORLD. FACED WITH THAT CHOICE, I WILL DEFEND AMERICA EVERY TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OTHERS WOULD HAVE CHOSEN DIFFERENTLY. THEY NOW AGREE THAT THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITH SADDAM OUT OF POWER. THEY JUST DIDN'T SUPPORT REMOVING SADDAM FROM POWER. MAYBE THEY WERE HOPING HE'D LOSE THE NEXT IRAQI ELECTION. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE SHOWED THE DICTATOR AND A WATCHING WORLD THAT WE SAY. BECAUSE OUR COALITION ACTED, SADDAM'S TORTURE CHAMBERS ARE CLOSED. BECAUSE WE ACTED, THE MIDDLE EAST IS MORE PEACEFUL. BECAUSE WE ACTED, IRAQ'S WEAPONS PROGRAMS ARE ENDED FOREVER. BECAUSE WE ACTED, NATIONS LIKE LIBYA HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE AND RENOUNCED THEIR WEAPONS PROGRAMS. BECAUSE WE ACTED, AN EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRACY IS RISING AT THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST. BECAUSE WE ACTED, THE WORLD IS MORE FREE AND AMERICA IS MORE SECURE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STILL FACE THUGS AND TERRORISTS IN IRAQ. WHO WOULD RATHER GO ON KILLING THE INNOCENT THAN ACCEPT THE ADVANCE OF LIBERTY. THEY KNOW THAT A FREE IRAQ WILL BE A MAJOR DEFEAT IN THE CAUSE OF TERROR. THIS COLLECTION OF KILLERS IS TRYING TO SHAKE THE WILL OF AMERICA AND THE CIVILIZED WORLD. THEY DON'T KNOW US VERY WELL. AMERICA WILL NEVER BE INTIMIDATED BY THUGS AND ASSASSINS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY STRIKING THE TERRORISTS IN IRAQ, DEFEATING THEM THERE SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO FACE THEM IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. WE'RE CALLING OTHER NATIONS TO HELP IRAQ BUILD A FREE SOCIETY WHICH WILL MAKE US ALL SAFER. WE'RE STANDING WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE AS THEY ASSUME MORE OF THEIR OWN DEFENSE AND MOVE TOWARDS SELF-GOVERNMENT. THESE AREN'T EASY TASKS. BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TASKS. WE WILL FINISH WHAT WE HAVE BEGUN, AND WE'LL WIN THIS IMPORTANT VICTORY AND WAR ON TERROR. [ APPLAUSE ] >> ON NATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICANS HAVE THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE CHOICE. OUR OPPONENTS SAY THEY'S PROVE OF BOLD ACTION IN THE WORLD, BUT ONLY IF NO OTHER GOVERNMENT DISAGREES. I'M ALL FOR UNITED ACTION. AND SO ARE THE 34 COALITION PARTNERS WE HAVE IN IRAQ RIGHT NOW. IN AMERICA, MUST NEVER OUTSOURCE AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY DECISIONS TO THE LEADERS OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> SOME OF OUR OPPONENTS ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE WAR ON TERROR IS REALLY A WAR AT ALL. THEY VIEW TERRORISM MORE AS A CRIME, A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INDICTMENTS. OUR NATION FOLLOWED THAT APPROACH AFTER THE WORLD TRADE CENTER WAS BOMBED IN 1993. THE MATTER WAS HANDLED IN THE COURTS AND THOUGHT TO BE SETTLED. THE TERRORISTS WERE STILL TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN, PLOTTING IN OTHER NATIONS AND DRAWING UP MORE AMBITIOUS PLANS. FOR THE CHAOS AND KARNAGE OF SEPTEMBER 11th, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SERVE OUR ENEMIES WITH LEGAL PAPERS. WITH THOSE ATTACKS, THE TERRORISTS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS DECLARED WAR ON THE UNITED STATES, AND WAR IS WHAT THEY GOT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING THIS WAR AND WHO HAVE SEEN THE ENEMY UNDERSTAND THE STAKES. LAST YEAR IN A LETTER HOME FROM THE IRAQI THEATER, A NAVY CORPSMAN NAMED LONNIE LEWIS WROTE THIS -- WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR -- LIFE, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THOSE RIGHTS, WE HAVE TO STOP THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. CORPSMAN LEWIS CONCLUDES, MY FAMILY IS FIRST, MY COUNTRY IS WHERE THEY LIVE, I WILL DEFEND IT. THIS IS THE CALIBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFENDING AMERICA. WE'RE COUNTING ON THEM. THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ AND THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST ARE DEPENDING ON THEM AND I ASSURE YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM IS IN GOOD HANDS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THIS NATION IS PROSPEROUS AND STRONG, YET WE NEED TO REMEMBER THE SOURCES OF AMERICA'S GREATNESS. WE'RE STRONG, BECAUSE WE LOVE FREEDOM. AMERICA HAS A SPECIAL CHARGE TO KEEP, BECAUSE WE ARE FREEDOM'S HOME AND DEFENDER. WE BELIEVE THAT FREEDOM IS THE DEEPEST NEED AND HOPE OF EVERY HUMAN HEART. WE BELIEVE THAT FREEDOM IS THE FUTURE OF EVERY NATION, AND WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM IS NOT AMERICA'S GIFT TO THE WORLD, IT IS THE ALL MIGHTY GOD'S GIFT TO EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS WORLD. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GREATEST STRENGTH OF THIS COUNTRY LIES IN THE HEARTS AND SOULS OF OUR CITIZENS. WE'RE STRONG BECAUSE OF THE VALUES WE TRY TO LIVE BY, COURAGE AND COMPASSION, REVERENCE AND INTEGRITY. WE'RE STRONG BECAUSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT HELP TO GIVE US DIRECTION AND PURPOSE, FAMILIES, AND SCHOOLS, AND RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS. THESE VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR LIVES. AND THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT OF OUR GOVERNMENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STAND FOR THE FAIR TREATMENT OF FAITH-BASED GROUPS SO THEY CAN RECEIVE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THEIR WORKS OF COMPASSION AND HEALING. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR GOVERNMENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE OF FAITH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STAND FOR WELFARE REFORMS THAT REQUIRE WORK AND STRENGTHEN MARRIAGE WHICH HAVE HELPED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FIND INDEPENDENCE AND DIGNITY. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR ANY ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN THOSE REFORMS AND SEND PEOPLE BACK INTO LIVES OF DEPENDENCE. WE STAND FOR THE CULTURE OF LIFE IN WHICH EVERY PERSON COUNTS, AND EVERY PERSON MATTERS. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANY LIFE AS A COMMODITY TO BE EXPERIMENTED UPON OR EXPLOITED OR CLONED. WE STAND FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGES WHO STRICTLY AND FAITHFULLY INTERPRET THE LAW. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR JUDGES WHO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY BY LEGISLATING FROM THE BENCH, AND TRY TO REMAKE THE CULTURE BY COURT ORDER. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE STAND FOR A CULTURE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN AMERICA. WE'RE CHANGING THE CULTURE OF AMERICA FROM ONE THAT HAS SAID IF IT FEELS GOOD, DO IT. IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM, BLAME SOMEBODY ELSE, TO A CULTURE IN WHICH EACH OF US UNDERSTANDS WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECISIONS WE MAKE. IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE A MOTHER OR A FATHER, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOVING YOUR CHILD WITH ALL YOUR HEART. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU LIVE, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IF YOU'RE A CEO IN AMERICA, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING THE TRUTH TO YOUR SHAREHOLDERS AND YOUR EMPLOYEES. AND IN THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY SOCIETY, EACH OF US IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOVING OUR NEIGHBOR, JUST LIKE WE'D LIKE TO BE LOVED OURSELF. [ APPLAUSE ] >> FOR ALL AMERICANS, THESE YEARS IN OUR HISTORY WILL ALWAYS STAND APART. THERE ARE QUIET TIMES IN THE LIFE OF A NATION, WHEN LITTLE IS EXPECTED OF OUR LEADERS. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES. YOU AND I ARE LIVING IN A PERIOD WHEN THE STAKES ARE HIGH, AND THE CHA CHALLENGES ARE DIFFICULT THE CHOICES ARE CLEAR, AND RESOLVE IS NEEDED. NONE OF US WILL EVER FORGET THAT WEEK WHEN ONE ERA ENDED AND ANOTHER BEGAN. SEPTEMBER THE 14th, 2001. I STOOD IN THE RUINS OF THE TWIN TOWERS. I REMEMBER A LOT THAT DAY. WORKERS IN HARDHATS WERE SHOUTING, ""WHATEVER IT TAKES."" ONE FELLOW POINTED AT ME AND SAID, ""DON'T LET ME DOWN."" AS WE ALL DID THAT DAY, THESE MEN AND WOMEN SEARCHING THROUGH THE RUBBLE TOOK IT PERSONALLY. I TOOK IT PERSONALLY. I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT GOES ON. I WILL NEVER RELENT IN BRINGING JUSTICE TO OUR ENEMIES. I WILL DEFEND AMERICA, WHATEVER IT TAKES. [ APPLAUSE ] >> IN THESE TIMES, I'VE ALSO BEEN WITNESS TO THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. NOT SO LONG AGO SOME HAD THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT THE AMERICAN CHARACTER, OUR CAPACITY TO MEET SERIOUS CHALLENGES. TO SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF-INTEREST. BUT AMERICANS HAVE GIVEN THEIR ANSWER. I'VE SEEN THE UNSELFISH COURAGE OF OUR TROOPS. I'VE SEEN THE HEROISM OF AMERICANS IN THE FACE OF DANGER. I'VE SEEN THE SPIRIT OF SERVICE AND COMPASSION RENEWED IN OUR COUNTRY. WE'VE ALL SEEN OUR NATION UNITE IN COMMON PURPOSE WHEN IT MATTERED MOST. WE WILL WANT ALL OF THESE QUALITIES FOR THE WORK AHEAD. WE HAVE A WAR TO WIN. AND THE WORLD IS COUNTING ON US TO LEAD THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM. WE HAVE A DUTY TO SPREAD COMPASSION AND OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY PART OF AMERICA. THIS IS THE WORK THAT HISTORY HAS SET BEFORE US. WE WELCOME IT. AND WE KNOW THAT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE BEST DAYS LIE AHEAD. GOD BLESS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU ALL. >>",2015-11-07 17:31:52,2000-09-11,Clearwater,Florida

WE'RE HONORED THAT YOU START IN FLORIDA. >> FOUR MORE YEARS! >> THIS TEAM WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. AFTER THIS RALLY, MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO DOOR-TO-DOOR, REGISTER VOTERS. AND FROM HERE TO ELECTION DAY, WE WILL WORK OUR HEARTS OUT SO THAT FLORIDA GOES FOR GEORGE W. BUSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY WIFE AND I ARE SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU BROUGHT YOUR SECRET WEAPON WITH YOU. AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A GREAT FIRST LADY, A PERSON -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW FOR A FACT -- I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE THE GREAT PRESIDENT THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT YOUR GREAT FIRST LADY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LAURA BUSH. [ CHEERS ] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, JEB. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE IN FLORIDA. IT'S TERRIFIC. THIS IS VERY FIRST RALLY, THE-cG FIRST RALLY OF THIS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. AND IT'S HERE IN FLORIDA, IN ORLANDO, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE WANTED IT TO BE. [ CHEERS ] MY HUSBAND AND I FIRST TRAVELED TOGETHER IN OUR VERY FIRST CAMPAIGN IN 1978. HE WAS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS THEM AND WE TRAVELED UP AND DOWN WEST TEXAS, THE PANHANDLE OF WEST TEXAS -- [ CHEERS ] AND THE RACE DIDN'T TURN OUT JUST LIKE WE HOPED IT WOULD, BUT WE HAD A GREAT TIME. AND BELIEVE ME, YOU LEARN A LOT ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND WHEN YOU SPEND THAT MUCH TIME IN A CAR WITH HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, HE HAD EVEN CONVINCED ME TO VOTE FOR HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO FAR, OF COURSE, HE HASN'T GIVEN ME ANY REASON TO CHANGE MY MIND. [ CHEERS ] I LIKE TO THINK THAT I'M MY HUSBAND'S BIGGEST FAN. BUT LOOKING OUT AT YOU, I THINK I'VE GOT SOME COMPETITION. [ CHEERS ] AS I'VE TRAVELED -- AS I'VE TRAXED AROUND THE UNITED STATES WITH MY HUSBAND, I'VE SEEN HIM ENCOURAGE YOUNG CHILDREN TO LEARN TO READ OR GO TO COLLEGE. I'VE SEEN HIM PITCH IN AND HELP A FAMILY BUILD A NEW HOME FOR THEMSELVES. I'VE SEEN HIM WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ON OUR MILITARY BASES. [ CHEERS ] I'VE SEEN HIM THANKING SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND AIRMEN AND MARINES FOR THEIR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. MY HUSBAND TREATS THE PEOPLE HE MEETS WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND THAT -- [ CHEERS ] THE SAME -- THE SAME DIGNITY AND RESPECT THAT HE HAS FOR THE OFFICE HE HOLES. [ CHEERS ] -- FOR THE OFFICE HE HOLDS. TODAY WE'RE STARTING ON OUR LAST CAMPAIGN. AND I'LL HAVE TO SAY CAMPAIGNING IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM THAT FIRST ONE IN 1978. THESE DAYS WE GET TO TRAVEL IN A VERY NICE AIRPLANE INSTEAD OF AN OLD CHEVY CUTLASS. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE TWO OF US ANYMORE. BUT TODAY WE FACE A DIFFERENT WORLD THAN WE FACED BACK THEN. THESE ARE ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING TIMES FOR OUR COUNTRY. AND THEY ARE TIMES THATQWe REQUIRE STEADY AND STRONG ANDSo3 DISCIPLINED LEADERS. AND I'M PROUD THAT MY HUSBAND -- [ CHEERS ] I'M PROUD THAT -- >> FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS! >> I'M PROUD -- I'M PROUD THAT MY HUSBAND IS THAT KIND OF LEADER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY HUSBAND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ CHEERS ] >> THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU ALL. THANKS FOR COMING. TURNS OUT THE CROWD IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIGGERk WHEN LAURA COMES ALONG. AMERICA LOVES HER ALMOST AS MUCH AS I LOVE HER. [ CHEERS ]tC> I THINK SHE DESERVES FOUR MORE YEARS AS THE FIRST LADY./&n [ CHEERS ]fRy YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA AGAIN. [ CHEERS ]t( THERE'S A BIG ELECTION COMING UP AND I THOUGHT I WOULD COME DOWN FOR A LITTLE SPRING TRAINING. IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD CHANCE TO BE WITH BROTHER. HE'S A GREAT GOVERNOR OF THIS GREAT STATE. [ CHEERS ]S LIKE ME, MARRIED WELL. I APPRECIATE COLUMBA BEING HERE AS WELL. [ CHEERS ] I USED TO SAY THAT JEB WAS THE COOLEST GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY. THAT'S UNTIL ARNOLD GOT ELECTED. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING ABOUT GREAT LEADERS, I MADE A REALLY GOOD CHOICE WHEN I ASKED DICK CHENEY TO BE MY RUNNING MATE. [ CHEERS ]8nt<c MANY STRONG SUPPORTERS WE HAVE HERE IN FLORIDA. WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING SOME QUALITY TIME u THIS STATE. [ CHEERS ]8n WE'RE HERE TO EARN THE VOTE, ANDP WE NEED YOUR HELP. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU DO WANT TO HELP. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO IS ENCOURAGE YOUR NEIGHBORS TO VOTE. WE WANT A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WANT PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE DOING THEIR DUTY IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT IS TO SHOW UP TO THE POLLS. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN YOU GET THEM HEADED TO THE POLLS, YOU MIGHT SUGGEST WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. AND THAT IS BUSH-CHENEY FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. [ CHEERS ] >> FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS! >> AND BY THE WAY, WE'VE SET UP A WEBSITE. SO THAT YOU CAN GET ON TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO VOLUNTEER. WE NEED YOUR HELP. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO ASK FOR. IT'S NOT VERY -- IT'S NOT VERY COMPLICATED. IT'S GEORGEWBUSH.COM. THAT'S AN EASY ONE FOR ME TO REMEMBER. WITH YOUR HELP, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE FLORIDA A PART OF A GREAT NATIONWIDE VICTORY THIS NOVEMBER. [ CHEERS ] I'M SO THANKFUL FOR YOU ALL COMING. I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT TWO MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS IS WITH US, RICK KELLER AND TOM FEENEY. [ CHEERS ] LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TONY JENNINGS IS HERE. I APPRECIATE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JENNINGS. TOM GALLAGHER IS A STATEWIDE OFFICIAL. I'M PROUD MY FRIEND IS HERE, TOM GALLAGHER. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE STATE HOUSE MEMBERS, ALL THE LOCAL OFFICIALS. THE HIGH SHERIFF IS WITH US TODAY. THANK ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE THAT ARE WITH US TODAY. [ CHEERS ] I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND, ROBERTO CANDALERIO FOR LEADING THE INVOCATION. THANK YOU, LINDA FAULKNER, FOR LEADING THIS GREAT CROWD IN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. I GOT HERE A LITTLE LATE. I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR MY FRIEND, BILLY RAY CYRUS. THANK YOU, BILLY RAY. THE CATINAS ARE WITH US AS WELL. I'M PROUD THEY'RE HERE. I'M PROUD TO HAVE THEIR SUPPORT. MY FRIEND, LYNN SWANN, IS WITH US. HE'S WELCOME TO COME TO FLORIDA. WE'RE A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT INVITING HIM DOWN TO DALLAS. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. A LOT OF COWBOY FANS THERE. I APPRECIATE SO VERY MUCH FOOTY FOR BEING HERE. FOOTY, THANK YOU FOR EMCEEING THIS EVENT. CHAIRMAN OF BUSH-CHENEY, MIKE ROSCO, THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF MONTANA, IS WITH US TODAY. MARK, THANK YOU FOR COMING. MY FRIEND, AL HOFFMAN, WHO WAS WORKED SO HARD IN THIS STATE IS WITH US. CAROLE JEAN JORDAN, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FLORIDA REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WITH US. MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU'RE WITH US. [ CHEERS ] I APPRECIATE YOU COMING. I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE GETTING ON BUSSES AND VANS TODAY FOR A VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE. THANKS FOR DOING THAT. THE EFFORT IS GOING TO HELP US. IT WILL HELP OUR ENTIRE TICKET. WE HAVE A STRONG SLATE OF CANDIDATES. WE'RE COMING INTO AN HISTORIC ELECTION AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN AN HISTORIC VICTORY THIS NOVEMBER. [ CHEERS ] THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CONTEST IS OVER. I FINALLY GOT AN OPPONENT. [ BOOS ] >> HE'S FOLLOWING AN INTERESTING STRATEGY. THE OTHER DAY HERE IN FLORIDA, HE CLAIMED SOME IMPORTANT ENDORSEMENTS FROM OVERSEAS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WON'T TELL US THE NAME OF THE FOREIGN ADMIRERS. THAT'S OKAY. IN A WAY, I'M NOT TOO WORRIED, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO KEEP MY CAMPAIGN RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA. [ CHEERS ] >> USA! USA! >> HE'S AN EXPERIENCED SENATOR. AND HE'S BUILT UP QUITE A RECORD. IN FACT, SENATOR KERRY HAS BEEN IN WASHINGTON LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE BOTH SIDES ON JUST ABOUT EVERY ISSUE. SENATOR KERRY VOTED FOR THE PATRIOT ACT, FOR NAFTA, FOR THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT AND FOR THE USE OF FORCE IN IRAQ. NOW HE OPPOSES THE PATRIOT ACT. NAFTA. THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT. AND THE LIBERATION OF IRAQ. [ BOOS ] MY OPPONENT CLEARLY FEELS STRONGLY ABOUT EACH OF THESE ISSUES. [ LAUGHTER ] SO STRONGLY THAT ONE POSITION IS NEVER JUST ENOUGH. [ CHEERS ] HE DEMONSTRATED THE TECHNIQUE THE OTHER DAY. SOMEONE ASKED SENATOR KERRY WHY HE VOTED AGAINST THE $87 BILLION FUNDING BILL TO HELP OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. ""I ACTUALLY DID VOTE FOR THE $87 BILLION BEFORE I VOTED AGAINST IT."" [ LAUGHTER ] END OF QUOTE. THAT SURE CLEARS THINGS UP, DOESN'T IT? HIS ANSWERS AREN'T ALWAYS CLEAR. BUT THE VOTERS WILL HAVE A VERY CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. [ CHEERS ] IT IS THE CHOICE BETWEEN -- IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN KEEPING THE TAX RELIEF THAT IS MOVING THIS ECONOMY FORWARD OR PUTTING THE BURDEN OF HIGHER TAXES BACK ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [ NO ] IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN AN AMERICA THAT LEADS THE WORLD WITH STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE. OR AN AMERICA THAT IS UNCERTAIN IN THE FACE OF DANGER. NOW, I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS DEBATE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CAMPAIGN. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. AND -- IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, WE'VE ACHIEVED GREAT THINGS. AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE HAVE A POSITIVE VISION FOR THE YEARS AHEAD. A POSITIVE VISION FOR WINNING THE WAR AGAINST TERROR. A POSITIVE VISION FOR EXTENDING PEACE AND FREEDOM THROUGHOUT OUR WORLD. A POSITIVE VISION FOR CREATING JOBS AND PROMOTING OPPORTUNITY AND COMPASSION HERE AT HOME. WE WILL LEAVE NO DOUBT WHERE WE STAND. WE WILL WIN ON THE 2nd OF NOVEMBER. [ CHEERS ] THE LAST -- THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BROUGHT SERIOUS CHALLENGES. AND WE'VE GIVEN SERIOUS ANSWERS. WE CAME TO OFFICE WITH THE STOCK MARKET IN DECLINE AND AN ECONOMY HEADING INTO RECESSION. WE DELIVERED HISTORIC TAX RELIEF. AND NOW OUR ECONOMY IS THE FASTEST GROWING OF ANY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION. [ CHEERS ] WE HAD TO CONFRONT CORPORATE CRIMES THAT COST PEOPLE THEIR JOBS AND THEIR SAVINGS. WE PASSED STRONG CORPORATE REFORMS. AND WE MADE IT CLEAR WE WILL NOT TOLERATE DISHONESTY IN THE BOARD ROOMS OF AMERICA. [ CHEERS ] WE SAW WAR AND GRIEF ARRIVE ON A QUIET SEPTEMBER MORNING, SO WE PURSUED THE TERRORIST ENEMY ACROSS THE WORLD. WE HAVE CAPTURED OR KILLED MANY OF THE KEY LEADERS OF THE AL QAEDA NETWORK. [ CHEERS ] AND THE REST OF THEM WILL KNOW THERE IS NO CAVE OR HOLE DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE FROM AMERICAN JUSTICE. [ CHEERS ] WE CONFRONTED THE DANGERS OF STATE-SPONSORED TERROR AND THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. SO WE ENDED TWO OF THE MOST VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS REGIMES ON EARTH. WE FREED OVER 50 MILLION PEOPLE. ONCE AGAIN, AMERICA IS PROUD TO LEAD THE ARMIES OF LIBERATION. [ CHEERS ] WHEN DICK CHENEY AND I CAME TO WASHINGTON, WE FOUND A MILITARY THAT WAS UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERAPPRECIATED. SO WE GAVE OUR MILITARY THE RESOURCES AND RESPECT THEY DESERVE. [ CHEERS ] TODAY NO ONE CAN QUESTION THE SKILL AND THE STRENGTH AND THE SPIRIT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [ CHEERS ] IT IS A -- IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S JOB TO CONFRONT PROBLEMS. NOT TO PASS THEM ON TO FUTURE PRESIDENTS OR FUTURE GENERATIONS. [ CHEERS ] IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S JOBNi TO DECISIONS AND TO KEEP HIS COMMITMENTS. AND THAT IS HOW I CONTINUE TO LEAD OUR GREAT NATION. >> FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR/6 MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS! >> GREAT EVENTS WILL TURN ON THIS ELECTION.NF THE MAN WHO SITS INq THE OVAL OFFICE WILL SET THE COURSE OF THE WAR ON TERROR AND THE DIRECTION OF OUR ECONOMY. SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF AMERICA ARE AT STAKE. THE OTHER SIDE HADN'T OFFERED MUCH IN THE WAY OF STRATEGIES TO WIN THE WAR OR POLICIES TO EXPAND OUR ECONOMY. SO FAR ALL WE HEAR FROM THAT SIDE IS BITTERNESS AND PARTISAN ANGER. ANGER IS NOT AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE OF AMERICA. [ CHEERS ] WE WILL TAKE ON THE BIG ISSUES WITH OPTIMISM AND RESOLVE AND DETERMINATION. AND WE'LL MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WE STAND READY TO LEAD THIS NATION FOR FOUR MORE YEARS! [ CHEERS ] A BIG ISSUE FOR EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA IS THEs FEDERAL TAX BURDEN. THE LARGEST TAX RELIEF SINCE RONALD REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT. WE HAVE LEFT MORE MONEY IN THE HANDS THAT EARNED IT. [ CHEERS ] BY SPENDING AND INVESTING AND HELPING TO CREATE NEW JOBS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE USED THEIR MONEY FAR BETTER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE. [ CHEERS ]he OH, I KNOW THERE ARE SOME ECONOMIC PESSIMISTS WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT GOOD NEWS ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC. I TELL YOU WHY. I KNOW WHAT WE'VE OVERCOME. I'VE SEEN THE SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I'VE SEEN AMERICANS OVERCOME ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. AND BECAUSE OF GOOD POLICIES AND THE HARD WORK OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, OUR ECONOMY IS STRONG AND IT IS GROWING STRONGER. [ CHEERS ] ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003 WAS THE FASTEST IN NEARLY 20 YEARS. MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY IS INCREASING. BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS RISING. DISPOSABLE INCOME IS RISING. INFLATION IS LOW. INTEREST RATES ARE LOW. HOME OWNERSHIP IS AT THE HIGHEST RATE EVER. [ CHEERS ] JOB CREATION IS GAINING STRENGTH. WE'VE ADDED MORE THAN 350,000 NEW JOBS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. THE TAX RELIEF WE PASSED IS WORKING. [ CHEERS ] MY OPPONENT HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF TAX RELIEF. WHEN WE PASS AN INCREASE IN THE CHILD CREDIT TO HELP FAMILIES, HE VOTED AGAINST IT. WHEN WE REDUCED THE MARRIAGE PENALTY, HE VOTED AGAINST IT. [ CROWD BOOING ] >> WHEN WE CREATED A LOWER 10% TAX RATE FOR WORKING FAMILIES, HE VOTED AGAINST IT. WHEN WE REDUCED THE TAX RATE ON DIVIDENDS THAT MANY SENIORS DEPEND ON, SENATOR KERRY VOTED AGAINST IT. WHEN WE GAVE SMALL BUSINESSES A TAX INCENTIVE TO EXPAND AND HIRE HE VOTED AGAINST IT. [ CROWD BOOING ] WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE A PATTERN HERE. SENATOR KERRY IS ONE OF THE MAIN OPPONENTS OF TAX RELIEF IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. HOWEVER, WHEN TAX INCREASES ARE PROPOSED, IT'S A LOT EASIER TO GET A YES VOTE OUT OF HIM. OVER THE YEARS, HE'S VOTED OVER 350 TIMES FOR HIGHER TAXES ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [ CROWD BOOS ] INCLUDING THE BIGGEST TAX INCREASE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. HE ALSO SUPPORTED A 50 CENT GALLON TAX ON GASOLINE. [ CROWD BOOS ] HE WANTED YOU TO PAY ALL THAT MONEY AT THE PUMP AND WOULDN'T EVEN THROW IN A FREE CAR WASH. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW SENATOR KERRY IS PROPOSING A LOT OF NEW FEDERAL SPENDING IN THIS CAMPAIGN. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT SOMEHOW. THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN SENATOR KERRY'S SPENDING PROMISES AND SENATOR KERRY'S PROMISE OF A LOWER DEFICIT. IT'S WHAT I CALL A TAX GAP. GIVEN SENATOR KERRY'S RECORD OF SUPPORTING TAX INCREASES, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR HOW HE'S GOING TO FILL THE TAX GAP. HE'S GOING TO TAX ALL OF YOU. [ CROWD BOOS ] FORTUNATELY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE HIM THAT CHANCE. [ CHEERS ] HIGHER TAXES RIGHT NOW WOULD UNDERMINE GROWTH AND DESTROY JOBS JUST AS OUR ECONOMY IS GETTING STRONGER. IT'S BAD POLICY. TO HELP GROW THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND CREATE MORE JOBS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. WE SHOULD MAKE ALL THE TAX CUTS PERMANENT. [ CHEERS ] WE MUST DO MORE TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GROWING TO CREATE JOBS. WE NEED TO MAINTAIN SPENDING DISCIPLINE IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. I'VE HAD PLANS TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES FROM FRIVOLOUS AND JUNK LAWSUITS AND NEEDLESS REGULATION. [ CHEERS ] WE HAVE A PLAN TO CONTROL THE COST OF HEALTHCARE AND GET PEOPLE BETTER ACCESS THROUGH ASSOCIATION HEALTHCARE PLANS AND HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. AND IN ORDER TO CONTROL HEALTHCARE COSTS AND TO MAKE SURE DOCS ARE AVAILABILITY WE NEED NATIONAL MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM NOW. [ CHEERS ] WE HAVE A STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE FLORIDA GOODS ARE SOLD IN MARKETS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. I PROPOSE A GREAT STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE OUR NATION HAS A SOUND ENERGY PLAN, A PLAN THAT ENCOURAGES CONSERVATION, A PLAN THAT MODERNIZES THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, A PLAN TO MAKE AMERICA LESS DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN SOURCES OF ENERGY. YOU KNOW, THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT JOB CREATION. MY OPPONENT TALKS ABOUT IT, BUT HE'S AGAINST EVERY ONE OF THESE JOB-CREATING MEASURES. IF YOU TALK ABOUT JOBS AND ECONOMIC ISOLATIONISM WON'T GET ANYONE HIRED. THE WAY TO CREATE JOBS IS CREATE A PRO GROWTH, PRO ENTREPRENEUR, PRO SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT. AND THAT'S GEORGE W. BUSH. [ CHEERS ] OUR FUTURE -- OUR FUTURE ALSO DEPENDS ON AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD. THE MOMENTUM OF FREEDOM IN OUR TIME IS STRONG. BUT WE STILL FACE SERIOUS DANGERS. AL QAEDA IS WOUNDED BUT NOT BROKEN. TERRORISTS ARE TESTING OUR WILL IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. REGIMES IN NORTH KOREA AND IRAN ARE CHALLENGING THE PEACE. IF AMERICA SHOWS WEAKNESS AND UNCERTAINTY IN THIS DECADE, THE WORLD WILL DRIFT TOWARD TRAGEDY. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH! [ CHEERS ] THIS NATION IS STRONG AND CONFIDENT IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM. AND TODAY, NO FRIEND OR ENEMY DOUBTS THE WORD OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [ CHEERS ] AMERICA -- AMERICAN ALLIES GAVE AN ULTIMATUM TO THE TALIBAN IN AFGHANISTAN. THE TALIBAN CHOSE DEFINES AND -- DEFIANCE, AND THE TALIBAN ARE NO LONGER IN POWER. [ CHEERS ] AMERICA AND HER ALLIES GAVE AN ULTIMATUM TO THE TERROR REGIME IN IRAQ. THE DICTATOR CHOSE DEFIANCE AND THE DICTATOR TODAY SITS IN A PRISON CELL. [ CHEERS ] SEPTEMBER THE 11th, 2001, TAUGHT A LESSON I WILL NEVER FORGET. AMERICA MUST CONFRONT THREATS BEFORE THEY FULLY MATERIALIZE. IN IRAQ, MY ADMINISTRATION LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND WE SAW A THREAT. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND THEY SAW A THREAT. THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE, AND IT SAW A THREAT. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND MADE REGIME CHANGE IN IRAQ THE POLICY OF OUR GOVERNMENT. IN 2002, THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL YET AGAIN DEMANDED A FULL ACCOUNTING OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS PROGRAMS. AND AS HE HAD FOR OVER A DECADE, SADDAM HUSSEIN REFUSED TO COMPLY. SO WE HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE. EITHER TAKE THE WORD OF A MADMAN OR TO TAKE ACTION TO DEFEND AMERICA FACED WITH THAT CHOICE. I WILL DEFEND AMERICA EVERY TIME! [ CHEERS ] MY OPPONENT ADMITS THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS A THREAT. HE JUST DIDN'T SUPPORT MY DECISION TO REMOVE SADDAM FROM POWER. MAYBE HE WAS HOPING SADDAM WOULD LOSE THE NEXT IRAQI ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] WE SHOWED THE DICTATOR AND A WAITING WORLD THAT AMERICA MEANS WHAT IT SAYS. [ CHEERS ] BECAUSE OUR COALITION ACTED, SADDAM HUSSEIN'S TORTURE CHAMBERS ARE CLOSED. [ CHEERS ] BECAUSE WE ACTED, IRAQ'S WEAPONS PROGRAMS ARE ENDED FOREVER. [ CHEERS ] BECAUSE WE ACTED, NATIONS LIKE LIBYA HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE AND RENOUNCED THEIR OWN WEAPONS PROGRAMS. [ CHEERS ] BECAUSE WE ACTED, AN EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRACY IS RISING AT THE VERY HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST. BECAUSE WE ACTED, THE WAR IS MORE FREE AND AMERICA IS MORE SECURE. [ CHEERS ] WE STILL FACE THUGS AND THEORISTS IN IRAQ. WHO WOULD RATHER GO ON KILLING THE INNOCENT THAN ACCEPT THE ADVANCE OF LIBERTY. THERE'S A REASON. THEY KNOW THAT A FREE IRAQ WILL BE A MAJOR DEFEAT FOR THE CAUSE OF TERROR. THIS COLLECTION OF KILLERS IS TRYING TO SHAKE THE WILL OF THE UNITED STATES.Q7/x THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND US. AMERICA WILL NEVER BE INTIMIDATED BY THUGS AND=C/ ASSASSINS. [ CHEERS ]pnu6<NhKi3Ny >> USA! USA! >> WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY STRIKING THE TERRORISTS IN IRAQ. WE ARE ON THE OFFENSIVE. WE WILL DEFEAT THEM THERE SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO FACE THEM IN OUR OWN CITIES. [ CHEERS ] OTHER NATIONS ARE HELPING US TO BUILD A FREE SOCIETY IN IRAQ BECAUSE A FREE IRAQ WILL MAKE US ALL SAFER.y$N WE'RE STANDING WITH THExD IRAQI PEOPLE AS THEY ASSUME6 MORE OFkZ THEIR OWN DEFENSE AND MOVE/ TOWARD SELF GOVERNMENT. THESEq AREN'Tn EASY TASKS. BUT THEY'REc ESSENTIAL TASKS. AMERICA WILL FINISH WHAT WE HAVE BEGUN. AND WE WILL WIN THIS ESSENTIALw VICTORY IN THE WAR ON TERROR. [ CKG#W [ CHEERS ]dcOy ONs NATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICANS HAVE THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE CHOICE. MY OPPONENT SAYS HE APPROVES THE BOLD ACTION IN THE WORLD BUT ONLY IF OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T OBJECT. [ CROWD BOOING ] I'M ALL FOR UNITED ACTION, AND SO ARE OUR 34 COALITION PARTNERS IN IRAQ RIGHT NOW. [ CHEERS ] YET AMERICA MUST NEVER OUTSOURCE AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY DECISIONS TO THE LEADERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. [ CHEERS ] SOME ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE WAR ON TERROR IS REALLY A WAR AT ALL. SENATOR KERRY SAID -- AND I QUOTE -- ""THE WAR ON TERROR IS AS FAR LESS THAN A MILITARY OPERATION AND FAR MORE OF A INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING OPERATION."" I DISAGREE. I DISAGREE. OUR NATION FOLLOWED THIS APPROACH AFTER THE WORLD TRADE CENTER WAS BOMBED IN 1993. THE MATTER WAS HANDLED IN THE COURTS AND THOUGHT BY SOME TO BE SETTLED. THE TERRORISTS WERE STILL TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY'RE STILL PLOTTING IN OTHER NATIONS. THEY'RE STILL DRAWING UP MORE AMBITIOUS PLANS. AFTER THE CHAOS AND CARNAGE OF SEPTEMBER THE 11th, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SERVE OUR ENEMIES WITH LEGAL PAPERS. [ CHEERS ] WITH THOSE ATTACKS, THE TERRORISTS AND SUPPORTERS DECLARED WAR ON THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND WAR IS WHAT THEY GOT. [ CHEERS ] OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY HAVE TAKEN GREAT RISKS AND THEY'RE DOING GREAT WORK. [ CHEERS ] AT BASES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD, I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH THOSE WHO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY AND SACRIFICE FOR OUR SECURITY. I'VE SEEN THEIR GREAT DECENCY AND UNSELFISH COURAGE. I CAN ASSURE YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM IS IN GOOD HANDS. [ CHEERS ] THIS NATION IS PROSPEROUS AND STRONG, YET WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT OUR GREATEST STRENGTH IS IN THE HEARTS AND SOULS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS. WE'RE STRONG BECAUSE OF THE VALUES WE TRY TO LIVE BY, COURAGE AND COMPASSION, REFERENCE AND INTEGRITY. WE'RE STRONG BECAUSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT HELP GIVE US DIRECTION AND PURPOSE./R(T&HahP &HC% FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS AND RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS.w3 THESE VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS -- THESE VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR LIVES, AND THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT OF OUR GOVERNMENT. [ CHEERS ] WE STAND FOR THE FAIR TREATMENT OF FAITH-BASED GROUPS SO THEY CAN RECEIVE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THEIR WORKS OF COMPASSION AND HEALING. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR DISCRIMINATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGAINST PEOPLE OF FAITH! [ CHEERS ] WE STAND FOR WELFARE REFORMS THAT REQUIRE WORK AND STRENGTH AND MARRIAGE, WHICH HAVE HELPED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FIND THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND DIGNITY. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR ANY ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN THOSE REFORMS AND SEND PEOPLE BACK INTO LIVES OF DEPENDENCE. WE STAND FOR A CULTURAL LIFE IN WHICH EVERY PERSON COUNTS AND EVERY PERSON MATTERS. [ CHEERS ] WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANY LIFE AS A COMMODITY TO BE EXPERIMENTED UPON OR EXPLOITED OR CLONED. [ CHEERS ] WE STAND FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGES WHO STRICTLY AND FAITHFULLY INTERPRET THE LAW. [ CHEERS ] WE WILL NOT STAND FOR JUDGES WHO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY BY LEGISLATING FROM THE BENCH AND -- [ CHEERS ] OR JUDGES WHO TRY TO REMAKE THE VALUES OF AMERICA BY COURT ORDER. [ CHEERS ] WE STAND FOR A CULTURE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN AMERICA. [ CHEERS ] THIS CULTURE OF THE COUNTRY IS CHANGING FROM ONE THAT SAID ""IF IT FEELS GOOD, DO IT"" AND ""IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM, BLAME SOMEONE ELSE."" TO A CULTURE IN WHICH EACH OF US UNDERSTAND l RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECISIONS WE MAKE IN LIFE. [ CHEERS ] IF YOU WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE A MOTHER OR A FATHER, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOVING YOUR CHILD WITH ALL YOUR HEART. [ CHEERS ] IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU LIVE, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. [ CHEERS ] IF YOU'RE A CEO IN CORPORATE AMERICA, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING THE TRUTH TO YOUR SHAREHOLDERS AND YOUR EMPLOYEES. [ CHEERS ] AND IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY, EACH OF US IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOVING OUR NEIGHBOR JUST LIKE WE WOULD BE LOVED OURSELF. FOR ALL AMERICANS, THESE YEARS IN OUR HISTORY WILL ALWAYS STAND APART. THERE ARE QUIET TIMES IN THE LIFE OF A NATION WHEN LITTLE IS EXPECTED OF THE LEADERS. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES. YOU AND I ARE LIVING IN A PERIOD WHEN THE STAKES ARE HIGH. CHALLENGES ARE DIFFICULT. A TIME WHEN RESOLVE IS NEEDED. NONE OF US WILL EVER FORGET THAT WEEK WHEN ONE ERA ENDED AND ANOTHER BEGAN. ON SEPTEMBER THE 14th, 2001, I STOOD IN THE RUINS OF THE TWIN TOWERS. I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY. ONE GUY POINTED AT ME AND SAID, ""DON'T LET ME DOWN."" WORKERS IN HARD HATS WERE SHOUTING, ""WHATEVER IT TAKES!"" AND AS WE ALL DID THAT DAY, THESE MEN AND WOMEN SEARCHING THROUGH THE RUBBLE TOOK IT PERSONALLY. I TOOK IT PERSONALLY. I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT GOES ON. I WILL NEVER RELENT IN BRINGING JUSTICE TO OUR ENEMIES. I WILL DEFEND THE SECURITY OF AMERICA, WHATEVER IT TAKES! [ CHEERS ] IN THESE TIMES -- IN THESE TIMES I'VE ALSO BEEN WITNESS TO THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. NOT SO LONG AGO, SOME HAD THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. OUR CAPACITY TO MEET SERIOUS CHALLENGES, OR TO SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF INTEREST. BUT AMERICANS HAVE GIVEN THEIR ANSWER. I'VE SEEN THE UNSELFISH COURAGE OF OUR TROOPS. I'VE SEEN THE HEROISM OF AMERICANS IN THE FACE OF DANGER. I'VE SEEN THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND COMPASSION RENEWED IN OUR COUNTRY. WE'VE ALL SEEN OUR COUNTRY UNITE IN A COMMON PURPOSE WHEN IT MATTERED MOST. WE'LL NEED ALL THESE QUALITIES FOR THE WORK AHEAD. WE HAVE A WAR TO WIN. THE WORLD IS COUNTING ON US TO LEAD THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND PEACE. WE HAVE A DUTY TO SPREAD OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY CORNER OF AMERICA. WITH YOUR HELP, WE'RE GOING TO SHARE A MESSAGE OF OPTIMISM AND NATIONAL STRENGTH WITH EVERY VOTER IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. [ CHEERS ] I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS CAMPAIGN AHEAD. I'M GOING TO GIVE IT MY ALL. [ CHEERS ] AND I'M COUNTING -- I'M COUNTING ON YOU ALL TO DO THE SAME. [ CHEERS ] TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS. TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS. GET OUT THE WORD. ASK PEOPLE TO JOIN OUR CAUSE, TO PARTICIPATE IN DEMOCRACY. WITH YOU AT MY SIDE, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WE'RE HEADED TO A VICTORY ON NOVEMBER THE 2nd. THANK YOU FOR COMING! GOD BLESS!

THIS PARTY IS MORE UNIFIED THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN COMING INTO A CONVENTION. IT IS AN EXCITING TIME, WE'RE RARING TO GO AND I REALIZE WE CAN'T WIN WITHOUT THE LARGEST TURNOUT EVER IN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARTY. I NEED YOUR HELP TO HELP ME DO THAT AND I MADE A LOT OF PROMISES 3 1/2 YEARS AGO WHEN I RAN FOR CHAIR OF THIS PARTY AND I'M PROUD TO STAND HERE AND SAY THAT IT WORKED. NAMING THE BILL RICHARDSON, WE CHANGED THE PRIMARY CALENDAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 25 YEARS SO WE CAN ALLOW STATES LIKE ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO TO BE RIGHT UP IN THE FRONT. WE HOSTED THE FIRST SPANISH RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE UNION EVER BEFORE. WE PUT OUR FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN NEW MEXICO, OUR THIRD DEBATE IN ARIZONA. TO SHOW THIS PARTY'S COMMITMENT TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. SO FOLKS, SOMEONE MUST HAVE JUST WALKED IN THE ROOM. [APPLAUSE] THEY DIDN'T JUMP UP HERE WHEN I WALKED IN THE ROOM. FOLKS, I NEED YOUR HELP. THIS IS THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO SAY. THIS PARTY HAS MET ITS COMMITMENT. WHAT WE SAID TO YOU WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED. WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS TOGETHER. WITH YOU I ASK YOU RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THIS ELECTION WILL BE WON OR LOST BY ONE VOTE. THAT PERSON YOU DIDN'T STOP MAY BE THE PERSON THAT DECIDES THIS ELECTION. YOU STOP EVERY PERSON YOU SEE. IF THEY DON'T STOP, YOU TACKLE THEM, YOU GET THEM TO THE POLLS AND GET THEM TO VOTE FOR JOHN KERRY AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT. LET'S GO GET THEM! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> TERRY MCCOULOUGH. SISTERS AND BROTHERS, FOR THE PURPOSES OF AN INTRODUCTION, STATE SENATER FROM THE 20TH DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS IRIS MARTINEZ. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I AM SO HONORED BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? WOMEN ARE MAKING STRIDES. I'M THE FIRST LATINO IN THE STATE SENATE IN ILLINOIS AND I'M VERY PROUD. THANKS TO ALL OF YOU HERE. I'M EXCITED BECAUSE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO IN ILLINOIS, I WAS AWARDED THE HILLARY CLINTON LEADERSHIP AWARD AND THAT'S BECAUSE ALL OF THESE GREAT WOMEN WHO I AM GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. THE STATE OF ILLINOIS HAS GOT SOME GREAT PEOPLE. OUT OF THAT STATE, WE CAME -- SENATOR CLINTON FROM ILLINOIS. AND GUESS WHAT? OUT OF THE STATE SENATE, WE HAVE BARACK OBAMA, SO I'M VERY HAPPY. BUT I KNOW THAT IN THIS ROOM, THIS LADY NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION. SHE'S THE VERY BEST THAT WE HAVE IN THE U.S. SENATE RIGHT NOW. SHE WAS A GREAT FIRST LADY, SOMEONE WHO ALL WOMEN ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD LOVE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. WOW! WHAT IS GREAT, GREAT TURNOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IRIS MARTINEZ, THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SO MANY GREAT LEADERS HERE TODAY AND I AM PROUD AND HONORED TO CALL SO MANY OF THEM MY FRIENDS. I COME TO YOU WITH ALL THE PASSION AND ENERGY THAT WE CAN MUSTER TOGETHER. TO ASK YOU TO DO WHAT I HEARD TERRY MCCOULOUGH PREACHING ABOUT -- WE CANNOT AFFORD -- I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF AMERICAN WE ARE, WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE DISASTEROUS PATH THAT GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY HAVE PUT THIS COUNTRY ON. I WANT TO THANK GLORY MALINA AND LINDA CHAVEZ, AND OF COURSE, TERRY MCCOULOUGH AND WE HAVE CONGRESSMAN ED PASTER, MY DEAR FRIEND HENRY SISNAROS, AND WHERE IS RUAL? THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS AND YEARS OF WORK ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. AND OF COURSE, FROM NEW YORK, I KNOW WE HAVE MARGARITA LOPEZ, ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO I WORK WITH ALL THE TIME. THERE ARE SO MANY OF YOU, I CAN'T GO DOWN THIS PATH OR I'LL GET IN TROUBLE. OH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR MR. PEREZ FROM CONNECTICUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS TOO MUCH FUN. [APPLAUSE] LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS, BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A BUSY SCHEDULE. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WANTING TO COME AND TALK WITH YOU. WASN'T IT GREAT TO HAVE A FUTURE FIRST LADY SPEAKING FLUENT SPANISH LAST NIGHT FROM THE PODIUM OF THE CONVENTION? [APPLAUSE] AND WON'T IT BE GREAT WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ORDER FOR AMERICA TO LEAD THE WORLD YOU CANNOT TURN YOUR BACK ON YOUR FRIENDS IN LATIN AMERICA, YOU MUST REACH OUT A HAND OF SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP. AND WON'T IT BE NICE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE ECONOMIES OF SO MANY COUNTRIES IN THE CARIBBEAN AND IN LATIN AMERICA ARE FUELED BY THE MONEY THAT COMES FROM HARD-WORKING PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND THAT WE MUST STOP THE PREDATORY PRACTICES THAT DENY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SO MANY OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN TO SEND THOSE DOLLARS BACK HOME. AND WON'T BE IT WONDERFUL WHEN WE HAVE A NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE NO PEOPLE MORE COMMITTED TO MILITARY SERVICE, MORE PATRIOTIC AND THEREFORE DESERVE MORE RESPECT THAN LATINO AMERICANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY WITH HONOR AND DISTINCTION. AND WON'T IT BE GREAT AGAIN TO HAVE A VICE PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT WORKING PEOPLE AND KNOWS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THOSE WHO GET UP EVERY DAY AND WORK HARD FOR A LIVING, THAT THE HALLIBURTONS AND THEIR EXECUTIVES CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND DO SO VERY WELL. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. THAT'S WHAT THIS CONVENTION IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT CHARGING US UP, ENERGIZING US, SENDING US OUT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE MESSAGE TO EVERYONE, BECAUSE IN THE 2000 ELECTION, HISPANIC AMERICANS SHOWED THE WAY. THEY REJECTED ZPWB OVERWHELMINGLY. NOW WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND MAKE SURE EVERY VOTE COUNTS AND WE GET THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR. SO I'M HERE TO THANK YOU, TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT, TO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING MY HUSBAND AND SUPPORTING ME, TO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, TO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING JOHN KERRY AND JOHN EDWARDS. BUT, ALL OF THIS ENERGY WILL NOT AMOUNT TO ANYTHING IF WE DON'T REGISTER PEOPLE TO VOTE AND MOTIVATE THEM TO VOTE. SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT EVERYONE YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT MAY SURPRISE YOU TO FIND OUT SOMEONE YOU KNOW WELL, SOMEONE FROM WORK, SOMEONE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, SOMEONE WHO YOU THINK YOU KNOW SOIRBLELY MAY NOT BE REGISTERED -- SOCIALLY MAY NOT BE REGISTERED OR MAYBE NEVER VOTE. SO WE CAN'T ASSUME ANYTHING. I DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANT IT. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THIS ELECTION IS FINALLY OVER. AND I KNOW VERY WELL THAT RIGHT NOW IN CRAWFORD, TEXAS, THEY'RE PLOTTING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY WIN INSTEAD OF US. SO WE GOT TO DO OUR PART. SO LET ME ASK YOU TO DO JUST THREE THINGS. PLEASE, TALK TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW, PARTICIPATE AND REGISTER VOTERS. YOU CAN GO TO MY WEBSITE, DOWNLOAD REGISTRATION FORMS FOR EVERY STATE IN THE UNION. WE HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED 10,000 PEOPLE. I WANT TO REGISTER TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN THIS ELECTION. I WANT TO WIN THIS FOR AMERICA AND THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN. AND THEN FINALLY, MAKE SURE WE MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO VOTE. TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, GET ON THOSE PHONE BANKS AND THAT EMAIL NETWORK, GET OUT THERE AND TURN OUT THE VOTE. AND EVEN IF YOU'RE IN A STATE THAT LOOKS LIKE, YOU KNOW, SENATOR KERRY WILL WINE, LIKE NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA, STILL TURN OUT THE VOTE, BECAUSE WE NEED TO RUN UP A BIG MARGIN. LAST NAME AL GORE GOT 500,000 MORE. I WANT JOHN KERRY TO GET FIVE MILLION MORE AND WE NEED TO GET THEM OUT OF NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY, PLEASE BE PART OF MAKING SURE EVERY VOTE COUNTS. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHERE I VOTE IN NEW YORK, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING THERE CHECKING US IN, THEY'RE LIKE ALL OVER 80 YEARS OLD. THEY EVER WORKED FOR DECADES. THEY DESERVE A REST. WE NEED TO BE THERE, BEING POLL WORKERS AND POLL WATCHERS, TO MAKE SURE THAT NO AMERICANS VOTE IS COUNTED OUT. BECAUSE IF WE COUNT ALL THE VOTES, ESPECIALLY OF HISPANIC AMERICANS, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO? WE'LL MEET AGAIN IN JANUARY AT THE INAUGURATION OF JOHN KERRY FOR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. >> LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. COME ON, FOLKS, GIVE HER A BIG SENDOFF. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE WAITING FOR THE NEXT FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES TO ARRIVE. TERESA HEINZ KERRY. SHE'S ON HER WAY, SHE'S GOING TO BE HERE. SO I ASK ALL OF YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEATS AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING AGAIN IATA UP TO SHOW SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE KERRY CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN DOING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO LET'S TAKE OUR SEATS. WE STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO DO BEFORE TERESA HEINZ KERRY COMES TO GREET US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> IT'S VERY HARD TO TRY TO GET ATTENTION WHEN WE HAVE A FABULOUS FIRST LADY SENATOR HERE. LET ME JUST TELL YOU, I AM BACK, I PROMISED YOU I LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THE TERMINATOR IS THE GOVERNOR. SO I'LL BE SAYING, I'LL BE BACK. IN A FEW MINUTES YOU'LL HEAR FROM OUR NEXT FIRST LADY, TERESA HEINZ KERRY. WHO I REALLY BELIEVE IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST LATINO FIRST LADY, FOLKS. YES! BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH HARD WORK GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE GOTTEN RECORD NUMBERS OF DOLLARS FOR A MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND THAT MEDIA CAMPAIGN, FOLKS, IS ONE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE OUR OUTREACH TO OUR COMMUNITY. SO WITHOUT TOO MUCH FURTHER ADO, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT -- LET ME MAKE A LITTLE COMMENT. THIS MORNING, I WAS ON AN INTERVIEW AND THEY ASKED ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIRST LADIES, FIRST LADY HILLARY CLINTON AND TERESA HEINZ KERRY. AND I SAID THEY'VE BOTH INTELLIGENT, BOTH BEAUTIFUL, BOTH TRUE WOMEN OF FEMININE CHARACTER AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS ONE OF THEM IS LATINO AND THE OTHER IS NOT. BUT WE LOVE THEM BOTH BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE WELL BY US IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY. WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE ARE SOME BEAUTIFULLY MADE VIDEO THAT WE'RE ROLLING OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT. IT'S A MESSAGE THAT SPEAKS TO US AND SPEAKS TO ALL AMERICANS. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LET'S ROLL IT OUT. THANK YOU. I'LL BE BACK. (music) [SPEAKING SPANISH] A LIST OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO JOHN KERRY READS LIKE A LIST OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY. AFTER GROWING UP AS ONE OF FOUR CHILDREN WITH LOVING PARENTS AND NOW WITH A WIFE AND CHILDREN OF HIS OWN, JOHN KERRY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE FAMILY IS ONE OF THE MOSE IMPORTANT THINGS IN OUR LIVES. FAMILY IS THERE TO GIVE US STRENGTH WHEN WE NEED IT. JUST AS WE GIVE OF OUR STRENGTH WHEN OUR FAMILY IS IN NEED. >> WORKING FAMILIES ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE LIVING BY THE OLDEST AND THE GREATEST OF AMERICAN VALUES. >> [SPEAKING SPANISH] >> SUPPORTING LATINOS IS MORE THAN SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND OUR CULTURAL VALUES AND HOW IMPORTANT FAMILY IS. >> JOHN KERRY HAS WORKED AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD MAKING FAMILIES STRONGER. REMOVING THOSE THINGS THAT HOLD THEM BACK. GIVING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO GROW AND PROSPER. >> THE VALUES THAT BUILT AMERICA, STRONG FAMILIES, DEEP FAITH. >> OUR FAITH IS WHAT GUIDES US. TELLING US WHAT'S RIGHT. WITH FAITH AS HIS GUIDING PRINCIPLE, JOHN KERRY WILL UNITE OUR COUNTRY AGAIN WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. AND BRING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TOGETHER AS ONE NATION UNDER GOD. >> [SPEAKING SPANISH] >> HONOR IS ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY'S MOSE HIGHLY VALUED QUALITIES. WITH HONOR COMES COURAGE AND A DEEP SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN HE VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY IN VIETNAM, HE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS EASY. >> WE WERE JUST BROTHERS, ALL OF WHOM FOUGHT UNDER THE SAME FLAG AND PRAYED TO THE SAME GOD. >> LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM, HE DID IT BECAUSE HE FELT IT WAS HIS DUTY. HE WAS WOUNDED, HE WAS DECORATED FOR VALOR, AND AS A LEADER OF MEN AT AN EARLY AGE, HE WAS QUIET AND RESERVED IN THE CALL UNDER FIRE. JUST AS HE LED HIS MEN TO SAFETY IN WARTIME, HE'LL LEAD OUR PEOPLE TO A BETTER PLACE AS PRESIDENT. BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, HE'LL INCREASE THE EARNINGS TO HAVE SEVEN MILLION WOMEN AND WHEN BY ABOUT $3,800 A YEAR. THIS MEANS MORE FOOD ON THE TABLE, A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND A DEEPER SENSE OF SECURITY THAN OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES. [SPEAKING SPANISH] >> AND OUR COMMUNITY TOMORROW WILL BE MADE UP OF OUR CHILDREN OF TODAY. JOHN KERRY RECOGNIZES THAT THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT CANNOT CONTINUE BEING UNDERFUNDED AND OUR CHILDREN CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE SHORTCHANGED. OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR COUNTRY'S MOSE PRECIOUS RESOURCE AND WORTHY OF OUR COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC RESOURCES. >> [SPEAKING SPANISH] >> HEAD START, SMART START, EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. >> JOHN KERRY BELIEVES THERE ARE FAMILIES HEALTH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS ANY POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S WHY HE'LL GIVE EVERY AMERICAN ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ALREADY HAVE. >> AND WE NEED TO MAKE THAT SAME PLAN AVAILABLE TO ALL AMERICANS. >> JOHN KERRY'S HEALTH CARE PLAN WILL PROTECT OUR MOSE VULNERABLE CITIZENS BY COVERING EVERY CHILD AND PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING MEDICARE. >> THE FAMILY, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE ARE THEMES THAT RESONATE WITH OUR LATINO FAMILIES AND TOUCH JOHN KERRY'S HEART. >> LIVES WILL BE BETTER WHEN WE DO WHAT IS FAIR AND WHAT IS RIGHT. TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN, SEEING TO THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR FAMILIES. [SPEAKING SPANISH] THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO JOHN KERRY. >> WE CAN BRING BACK OUR MIGHTY DREAM AGAIN. WE CAN MAKE AMERICA ALL THAT IT CAN BECOME. LET AMERICA BE AMERICA AGAIN. [SPEAKING SPANISH] >> THIS IS HENRY SISNAROS AND I SUPPORT JOHN KERRY AS THE LEADER WHO WILL HELP US FULFILL OUR DREAM. [NO AUDIO] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS. THANK YOU. >> WE CAN GO OUT THERE AND WIN THIS ONE BECAUSE LATINOS ARE ORGANIZED AND UNITED AND WORKING HARD NOT ONLY IN THE PARTY BUT EVERY PART OF OUR COMMUNITY WILL TURN OUT AND VOTE. AND OUR VOTE HAS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE LATINOS WHO DO NOT VOTE. BUT WE HAVE TO VOTE STRONGER AND IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO GET OUT OUR VOTE. SO LET'S MAKE SURE WE DO THAT. LET ME INTRODUCE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WORKING HARD IN THEIR STATE PARTY ORGANIZING THE STATE PARTY AND DOING A GREAT JOB. FIRST OF ALL, ART TORES FROM CALIFORNIA. HE'S THE STATE PARTY CHAIR. ART, STAND UP. WE ALSO HAVE FROM NEVADA, A STATE WE NEED AND A STATE WE CAN GET, MARTINEZ. WE CAN PULL IT OFF IN THAT STATE. THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE HISPANIC CAUCUS, MR. NELSON DIAZ. PLEASE STAND. LET ME TURN IT BACK OVER TO MY VICE CHAIR. >> THANK YOU, MADAME VICE CHAIR. FOR PURPOSES OF AN INTRODUCTION, SISTERS AND BROTHERS, LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN WHO HAS OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS HE'S BEEN IN CONGRESS PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE AN ADVOCATE FROM FOR ARIZONA AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, WORKERS' RIGHTS AND HE'S BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE TRULY NOT JUST REPRESENTING THE INTEREST OF THE STATE THAT HE COMES FROM, BUT FROM REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF ALL OF US. PLEASE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE A VERY PERSONAL HERO OF MINE, A MAN THAT I BELIEVE HAS DONE MANY GREAT THINGS FOR ALL OF US, THE CONGRESSMAN FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA, ED PASTOR. ED? >> THANK YOU. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] THIS MORNING, I HAVE A GREAT HONOR OF INTRODUCING TO YOU TERESA HEINZ KERRY. IT WAS EARLY FEBRUARY WHEN WE HAD THE ARIZONA PRIMARY AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET HER AND ONE OF THE EVENTS WAS A MEET-AND-GREET IN THE PASTOR HOUSE. MY WIFE [SPEAKING SPANISH] I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THIS GREAT WOMAN. AND SINCE THEN, I'VE HAD GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET HER, TALK TO HER AND GET TO KNOW HER BETTER. LET ME TELL YOU, SHE DOES HAVE OPINIONS. [APPLAUSE] AND THANK GOD THOSE OPINIONS FAVOR US! SHE KNOWS THE BITTER TASTE OF PREJUDICE. THE BAD MEMORY OF BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. AND WHAT IT IS TO FIGHT AS AN IMMIGRANT IN THIS COUNTRY. [SPEAKING SPANISH] IF YOU BELIEVE THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED A NEED A BETTER EDUCATION, THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER HEALTHCARE, SEND TERESA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IF YOU THINK THAT OUR SENIOR CITIZENS DESERVE A BETTER HEALTH PLAN, A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE, SEND HER TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED AND IMMIGRATION REFORM COMES ABOUT, SEND TERESA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [SPEAKING SPANISH] THE FIRST LADY OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY, TERESA HEINZ KERRY! >> PEACE. PEACE TO YOU. PEACE. THANK YOU FOR THE PEACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I AM HERE TODAY BOTH AS AN EXPRESSION AND AS A HOPE THAT OWL OF US WHO COME TO THIS COUNTRY HOLD AND BURNISH IN OUR HEARTS WHICH IS FOR SOME OF US, THE HOPE OF FREEDOM, THE HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY, THE HOPE FOR A CHANCE TO RUN AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. I TALKED ABOUT WOMEN LAST NIGHT BECAUSE FOR MUCH TOO LONG, THE VALUE, THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF WOMEN HAS NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN ANY MEASURE IN THE GOVERNMENTS. INDEED, IN NUMBERS IN THE G.D.P. OF OUR NATION. AND, YOU KNOW, IN MOST OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS, IF NOT ALL, THE G.D.P. OF THEIR NATIONS INCLUDES THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT THE WORTH, THE VALUE OF WORK THAT IS DONE WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD, WITHIN THE FAMILY MOSTLY BY WOMEN, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY. WHICH IS ABOUT 30% TO 40% OF G.D.P. IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IT'S HUGE. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS SPEND ANY MONEY. IT'S NOT A TAX PLAN, IT'S NOT A TAX BENEFIT. IT'S RESPECT. IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND IT'S DIGNITY. AND WHEN WE DO THAT, WE GIVE THOSE CAREGIVERS A SENSE OF THEMSELVES BEYOND ""THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND BEYOND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO."" IT'S A SENSE OF COLLABORATION, A SENSE OF A JOB WELL DONE. AND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM SOCIETY AND WE NEED TO DO THAT. FOR MOST LATIN PEOPLE, AND I'M ABOUT 7/8 LATIN, AND REALLY MIXED UP. I MEAN, TALKED ABOUT MIXED UP, ITALIAN, PORTUGUESE. I TRY EVERY DAY. AND FRENCH. YOU KNOW THAT FOR US ALL LIFE AROUND THE FAMILY IS THE GLUE, THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, IS MANY AND VERY OFTEN THE PLACE WHERE YOU FIND JOY, WHERE YOU FIND ORDER AND WHERE YOU FIND PAIN TOGETHER. RECENTLY, A COLUMNIST CHIDED ME SAYING THAT I REALLY WASN'T AN IMMIGRANT. BECAUSE ""I CAME FROM A COLONIAL POWER AND I WAS NOT POOR."" HELLO? NEVER HEARD OF REFUGEES AND PEOPLE WHO FLEE FROM DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES? NEVER HEARD OF WAITING FOR TWO YEARS FOR A VISA AS I DID? NEVER HEARD OF BEING SINGLE, ALONE, WORKING IN NEW YORK CITY AT 25 YEARS OLD AND IN A TOUGH JOB, FAR, FAR AWAY FROM YOUR PARENTS IN AFRICA? NEVER HEARD OF RAISING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF COUNSEL AND THE ARMS OF GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND AUNTS WHICH IS WHAT I GREW UP. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS. THE ONES WITH FAMILY ARE VERY FORTUNATE, BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY SHACKLED OR POOR TO KNOW WHAT AN IMMIGRANT LIFE IS. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ALL MORNING TAKING AWAY ALL YOUR SPACE AND TIME FROM OTHER PEOPLE, BUT ONE THING I LEARNED THE OTHER DAY WHICH I HAVE TO ADMIT MY IGNORANCE TO OR ABOUT, I WAS MEETING WITH SEVERAL WOMEN GROUPS IN FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA ON SMALL START-UP BUSINESS -- THE DIFFICULTIES OF CREDIT, BORROWING, ETC. ALL PRACTICAL THINGS. VERY INTERESTING. AND I AM INTERESTED IN THAT. BUT I WAS TALKING TO CUBAN-AMERICANS AS WELL AS OTHER AMERICANS, AND THE ONE THING THIS WOMAN SAID WAS SO INTERESTING. WAS, YOU KNOW, CUBANS REALLY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS HISPANICS. OH. AND THEN I WENT HOME AND I PHOTOGRAPHED THAT. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE STORIES ONE HEARS, THAT THE CUBANS GO WITH THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE, AND THE OTHERS WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, I SAID THIS IS SUCH TUMMY ROT, YOU KNOW? WHY? BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THE CONCLUSION THAT I CAME TO AND WHY A LOT OF CUBANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF MORE OF MY AGE THAT LOST -- LOST EARLY, NOT THEIR CHILDREN, IS THAT WHAT THEY LOST AS I DID WHEN MY COUNTRY IN MOZAMBIQUE BECAME A COMMUNIST COUNTRY AND MY PARENTS LOST EVERYTHING AT AGE 73 AND HAD TO LEAVE, IS THAT WHEN YOU LOSE THAT, NOT BEING ABLE TO GO BACK, IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SCAR. IT'S A TERRIBLE WOUND, AND SO WHEN WE HEAR OF CUBANS BEING VERY ANGRY, BEING VERY HOT, EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE ISSUES AS OPPOSED TO OTHER LATSEN AMERICANS WHO LEFT FOR OTHER REASONS, I NOW UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I REMEMBER. I STILL FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT MY COUNTRY TOO. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE TO EVERY DAY. HAVING SAID THAT, I SAY THIS FOR THE CUBAN COMMUNITY. WHAT WE HAVE MANY COMMON AND THE HISTORY WE HAVE TO BUILD FOR THE FUTURE IS SO MUCH MORE EXCITING THAN ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT OR HURTFUL OR THE VICIVE RIGHT NOW AND THIS'S WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT FROM NOW ON, THE FUTURE. SO, ARE THERE ANY BRAZILIANS HERE, FOR PETE'S SAKES? I KNOW -- [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] ANYWAY, YOU SEE THIS IS A WHOLE BIG FAMILY. AND WE HAVE A LOT -- A LOT TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN. AS WOW KNOW, I HAVE THREE BOYS. MY LATE HUSBAND AND I HAVE A GRANDCHILD. AND MY OLDEST SON IS TEACHING MY GRANDCHILD ALL THE PORTUGUESE SONGS, NURSERY RHYMES, WORDS THAT I TAUGHT HIM WHEN HE WAS LITTLE. AND IT'S SO CUTE TO SEE THAT. AND I'M JUST PRAYING THAT WHEN THINGS QUIET DOWN, I WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP AND TEACH EVEN MORE AND MORE GRANDCHILDREN. SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, THE ISSUES OF ACCESS, THE ISSUES OF LOANS AN CREDIT, THE ISSUES OF DIGNITY, OF RESPECT, OF INCLUSION, OF OPPORTUNITY,, THE ISSUES OF PRIDE AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT SO MUCH MATTER, TO ALL OF US, TO ALL PEOPLE REALLY, BUT CULTURALLY VERY MUCH TO LATIN PEOPLE. THEY'RE ISSUES THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR VERY HARD BECAUSE WITHOUT THOSE RESULTS, ANYTHING ELSE WE DO IS FOR NAUGHT. SO TO OUR FAMILIES AND A BRIGHT FUTURE, WE NEED YOUR HELP. IF YOU ALLOW ME, I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF YOU. ONE OF YOUR HONORARY. THANK YOU. [SPEAKING SPANISH] >>",2015-11-07 17:33:08,2004-07-28,Boston,Massachusetts

YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHERE I VOTE IN NEW YORK, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING THERE CHECKING US IN, THEY'RE LIKE ALL OVER 80 YEARS OLD. THEY EVER WORKED FOR DECADES. THEY DESERVE A REST. WE NEED TO BE THERE, BEING POLL WORKERS AND POLL WATCHERS, TO MAKE SURE THAT NO AMERICANS VOTE IS COUNTED OUT. BECAUSE IF WE COUNT ALL THE VOTES, ESPECIALLY OF HISPANIC AMERICANS, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO? WE'LL MEET AGAIN IN JANUARY AT THE INAUGURATION OF JOHN KERRY FOR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. >> LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. COME ON, FOLKS, GIVE HER A BIG SENDOFF. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE WAITING FOR THE NEXT FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES TO ARRIVE. TERESA HEINZ KERRY. SHE'S ON HER WAY, SHE'S GOING TO BE HERE. SO I ASK ALL OF YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEATS AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING AGAIN IATA UP TO SHOW SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE KERRY CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN DOING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO LET'S TAKE OUR SEATS.

IN A FEW MINUTES YOU'LL HEAR FROM OUR NEXT FIRST LADY, TERESA HEINZ KERRY. WHO I REALLY BELIEVE IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST LATINO FIRST LADY, FOLKS. YES! BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH HARD WORK GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE GOTTEN RECORD NUMBERS OF DOLLARS FOR A MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND THAT MEDIA CAMPAIGN, FOLKS, IS ONE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE OUR OUTREACH TO OUR COMMUNITY. SO WITHOUT TOO MUCH FURTHER ADO, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT -- LET ME MAKE A LITTLE COMMENT. THIS MORNING, I WAS ON AN INTERVIEW AND THEY ASKED ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIRST LADIES, FIRST LADY HILLARY CLINTON AND TERESA HEINZ KERRY. AND I SAID THEY'VE BOTH INTELLIGENT, BOTH BEAUTIFUL, BOTH TRUE WOMEN OF FEMININE CHARACTER AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS ONE OF THEM IS LATINO AND THE OTHER IS NOT. BUT WE LOVE THEM BOTH BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE WELL BY US IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY. WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE ARE SOME BEAUTIFULLY MADE VIDEO THAT WE'RE ROLLING OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT. IT'S A MESSAGE THAT SPEAKS TO US AND SPEAKS TO ALL AMERICANS. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LET'S ROLL IT OUT. THANK YOU. I'LL BE BACK. (music) [SPEAKING SPANISH] A LIST OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO JOHN KERRY READS LIKE A LIST OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY. AFTER GROWING UP AS ONE OF FOUR CHILDREN WITH LOVING PARENTS AND NOW WITH A WIFE AND CHILDREN OF HIS OWN, JOHN KERRY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE FAMILY IS ONE OF THE MOSE IMPORTANT THINGS IN OUR LIVES. FAMILY IS THERE TO GIVE US STRENGTH WHEN WE NEED IT. JUST AS WE GIVE OF OUR STRENGTH WHEN OUR FAMILY IS IN NEED. >> WORKING FAMILIES ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE LIVING BY THE OLDEST AND THE GREATEST OF AMERICAN VALUES. >> [SPEAKING SPANISH] >> SUPPORTING LATINOS IS MORE THAN SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND OUR CULTURAL VALUES AND HOW IMPORTANT FAMILY IS. >> JOHN KERRY HAS WORKED AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD MAKING FAMILIES STRONGER. REMOVING THOSE THINGS THAT HOLD THEM BACK. GIVING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO GROW AND PROSPER. >> THE VALUES THAT BUILT AMERICA, STRONG FAMILIES, DEEP FAITH. >> OUR FAITH IS WHAT GUIDES US. TELLING US WHAT'S RIGHT.

WITH HONOR COMES COURAGE AND A DEEP SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN HE VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY IN VIETNAM, HE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS EASY. >> WE WERE JUST BROTHERS, ALL OF WHOM FOUGHT UNDER THE SAME FLAG AND PRAYED TO THE SAME GOD. >> LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM, HE DID IT BECAUSE HE FELT IT WAS HIS DUTY. HE WAS WOUNDED, HE WAS DECORATED FOR VALOR, AND AS A LEADER OF MEN AT AN EARLY AGE, HE WAS QUIET AND RESERVED IN THE CALL UNDER FIRE. JUST AS HE LED HIS MEN TO SAFETY IN WARTIME, HE'LL LEAD OUR PEOPLE TO A BETTER PLACE AS PRESIDENT. BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, HE'LL INCREASE THE EARNINGS TO HAVE SEVEN MILLION WOMEN AND WHEN BY ABOUT $3,800 A YEAR. THIS MEANS MORE FOOD ON THE TABLE, A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND A DEEPER SENSE OF SECURITY THAN OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES. [SPEAKING SPANISH] >> AND OUR COMMUNITY TOMORROW WILL BE MADE UP OF OUR CHILDREN OF TODAY.

THANK YOU. >> WE CAN GO OUT THERE AND WIN THIS ONE BECAUSE LATINOS ARE ORGANIZED AND UNITED AND WORKING HARD NOT ONLY IN THE PARTY BUT EVERY PART OF OUR COMMUNITY WILL TURN OUT AND VOTE. AND OUR VOTE HAS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE LATINOS WHO DO NOT VOTE. BUT WE HAVE TO VOTE STRONGER AND IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO GET OUT OUR VOTE. SO LET'S MAKE SURE WE DO THAT. LET ME INTRODUCE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WORKING HARD IN THEIR STATE PARTY ORGANIZING THE STATE PARTY AND DOING A GREAT JOB. FIRST OF ALL, ART TORES FROM CALIFORNIA. HE'S THE STATE PARTY CHAIR. ART, STAND UP. WE ALSO HAVE FROM NEVADA, A STATE WE NEED AND A STATE WE CAN GET, MARTINEZ. WE CAN PULL IT OFF IN THAT STATE. THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE HISPANIC CAUCUS, MR. NELSON DIAZ. PLEASE STAND. LET ME TURN IT BACK OVER TO MY VICE CHAIR. >> THANK YOU, MADAME VICE CHAIR. FOR PURPOSES OF AN INTRODUCTION, SISTERS AND BROTHERS, LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN WHO HAS OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS HE'S BEEN IN CONGRESS PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE AN ADVOCATE FROM FOR ARIZONA AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, WORKERS' RIGHTS AND HE'S BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE TRULY NOT JUST REPRESENTING THE INTEREST OF THE STATE THAT HE COMES FROM, BUT FROM REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF ALL OF US. PLEASE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE A VERY PERSONAL HERO OF MINE, A MAN THAT I BELIEVE HAS DONE MANY GREAT THINGS FOR ALL OF US, THE CONGRESSMAN FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA, ED PASTOR. ED? >> THANK YOU. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] THIS MORNING, I HAVE A GREAT HONOR OF INTRODUCING TO YOU TERESA HEINZ KERRY. IT WAS EARLY FEBRUARY WHEN WE HAD THE ARIZONA PRIMARY AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET HER AND ONE OF THE EVENTS WAS A MEET-AND-GREET IN THE PASTOR HOUSE. MY WIFE [SPEAKING SPANISH] I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THIS GREAT WOMAN. AND SINCE THEN, I'VE HAD GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET HER, TALK TO HER AND GET TO KNOW HER BETTER. LET ME TELL YOU, SHE DOES HAVE OPINIONS. [APPLAUSE] AND THANK GOD THOSE OPINIONS FAVOR US! SHE KNOWS THE BITTER TASTE OF PREJUDICE. THE BAD MEMORY OF BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. AND WHAT IT IS TO FIGHT AS AN IMMIGRANT IN THIS COUNTRY. [SPEAKING SPANISH] IF YOU BELIEVE THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED A NEED A BETTER EDUCATION, THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER HEALTHCARE, SEND TERESA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IF YOU THINK THAT OUR SENIOR CITIZENS DESERVE A BETTER HEALTH PLAN, A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE, SEND HER TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED AND IMMIGRATION REFORM COMES ABOUT, SEND TERESA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [SPEAKING SPANISH] THE FIRST LADY OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY, TERESA HEINZ KERRY! >> PEACE. PEACE TO YOU. PEACE. THANK YOU FOR THE PEACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I AM HERE TODAY BOTH AS AN EXPRESSION AND AS A HOPE THAT OWL OF US WHO COME TO THIS COUNTRY HOLD AND BURNISH IN OUR HEARTS WHICH IS FOR SOME OF US, THE HOPE OF FREEDOM, THE HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY, THE HOPE FOR A CHANCE TO RUN AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. I TALKED ABOUT WOMEN LAST NIGHT BECAUSE FOR MUCH TOO LONG, THE VALUE, THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF WOMEN HAS NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN ANY MEASURE IN THE GOVERNMENTS. INDEED, IN NUMBERS IN THE G.D.P. OF OUR NATION. AND, YOU KNOW, IN MOST OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS, IF NOT ALL, THE G.D.P. OF THEIR NATIONS INCLUDES THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT THE WORTH, THE VALUE OF WORK THAT IS DONE WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD, WITHIN THE FAMILY MOSTLY BY WOMEN, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY. WHICH IS ABOUT 30% TO 40% OF G.D.P. IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IT'S HUGE. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS SPEND ANY MONEY. IT'S NOT A TAX PLAN, IT'S NOT A TAX BENEFIT. IT'S RESPECT. IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND IT'S DIGNITY. AND WHEN WE DO THAT, WE GIVE THOSE CAREGIVERS A SENSE OF THEMSELVES BEYOND ""THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND BEYOND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO."" IT'S A SENSE OF COLLABORATION, A SENSE OF A JOB WELL DONE. AND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM SOCIETY AND WE NEED TO DO THAT. FOR MOST LATIN PEOPLE, AND I'M ABOUT 7/8 LATIN, AND REALLY MIXED UP. I MEAN, TALKED ABOUT MIXED UP, ITALIAN, PORTUGUESE. I TRY EVERY DAY. AND FRENCH. YOU KNOW THAT FOR US ALL LIFE AROUND THE FAMILY IS THE GLUE, THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, IS MANY AND VERY OFTEN THE PLACE WHERE YOU FIND JOY, WHERE YOU FIND ORDER AND WHERE YOU FIND PAIN TOGETHER. RECENTLY, A COLUMNIST CHIDED ME SAYING THAT I REALLY WASN'T AN IMMIGRANT. BECAUSE ""I CAME FROM A COLONIAL POWER AND I WAS NOT POOR."" HELLO? NEVER HEARD OF REFUGEES AND PEOPLE WHO FLEE FROM DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES? NEVER HEARD OF WAITING FOR TWO YEARS FOR A VISA AS I DID? NEVER HEARD OF BEING SINGLE, ALONE, WORKING IN NEW YORK CITY AT 25 YEARS OLD AND IN A TOUGH JOB, FAR, FAR AWAY FROM YOUR PARENTS IN AFRICA? NEVER HEARD OF RAISING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF COUNSEL AND THE ARMS OF GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND AUNTS WHICH IS WHAT I GREW UP. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS. THE ONES WITH FAMILY ARE VERY FORTUNATE, BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY SHACKLED OR POOR TO KNOW WHAT AN IMMIGRANT LIFE IS. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ALL MORNING TAKING AWAY ALL YOUR SPACE AND TIME FROM OTHER PEOPLE, BUT ONE THING I LEARNED THE OTHER DAY WHICH I HAVE TO ADMIT MY IGNORANCE TO OR ABOUT, I WAS MEETING WITH SEVERAL WOMEN GROUPS IN FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA ON SMALL START-UP BUSINESS -- THE DIFFICULTIES OF CREDIT, BORROWING, ETC. ALL PRACTICAL THINGS. VERY INTERESTING. AND I AM INTERESTED IN THAT. BUT I WAS TALKING TO CUBAN-AMERICANS AS WELL AS OTHER AMERICANS, AND THE ONE THING THIS WOMAN SAID WAS SO INTERESTING. WAS, YOU KNOW, CUBANS REALLY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS HISPANICS. OH. AND THEN I WENT HOME AND I PHOTOGRAPHED THAT. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE STORIES ONE HEARS, THAT THE CUBANS GO WITH THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE, AND THE OTHERS WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, I SAID THIS IS SUCH TUMMY ROT, YOU KNOW? WHY? BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THE CONCLUSION THAT I CAME TO AND WHY A LOT OF CUBANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF MORE OF MY AGE THAT LOST -- LOST EARLY, NOT THEIR CHILDREN, IS THAT WHAT THEY LOST AS I DID WHEN MY COUNTRY IN MOZAMBIQUE BECAME A COMMUNIST COUNTRY AND MY PARENTS LOST EVERYTHING AT AGE 73 AND HAD TO LEAVE, IS THAT WHEN YOU LOSE THAT, NOT BEING ABLE TO GO BACK, IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SCAR. IT'S A TERRIBLE WOUND, AND SO WHEN WE HEAR OF CUBANS BEING VERY ANGRY, BEING VERY HOT, EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE ISSUES AS OPPOSED TO OTHER LATSEN AMERICANS WHO LEFT FOR OTHER REASONS, I NOW UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I REMEMBER. I STILL FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT MY COUNTRY TOO. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE TO EVERY DAY. HAVING SAID THAT, I SAY THIS FOR THE CUBAN COMMUNITY. WHAT WE HAVE MANY COMMON AND THE HISTORY WE HAVE TO BUILD FOR THE FUTURE IS SO MUCH MORE EXCITING THAN ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT OR HURTFUL OR THE VICIVE RIGHT NOW AND THIS'S WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT FROM NOW ON, THE FUTURE. SO, ARE THERE ANY BRAZILIANS HERE, FOR PETE'S SAKES? I KNOW -- [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] ANYWAY, YOU SEE THIS IS A WHOLE BIG FAMILY. AND WE HAVE A LOT -- A LOT TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN. AS WOW KNOW, I HAVE THREE BOYS. MY LATE HUSBAND AND I HAVE A GRANDCHILD. AND MY OLDEST SON IS TEACHING MY GRANDCHILD ALL THE PORTUGUESE SONGS, NURSERY RHYMES, WORDS THAT I TAUGHT HIM WHEN HE WAS LITTLE. AND IT'S SO CUTE TO SEE THAT. AND I'M JUST PRAYING THAT WHEN THINGS QUIET DOWN, I WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP AND TEACH EVEN MORE AND MORE GRANDCHILDREN. SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, THE ISSUES OF ACCESS, THE ISSUES OF LOANS AN CREDIT, THE ISSUES OF DIGNITY, OF RESPECT, OF INCLUSION, OF OPPORTUNITY,, THE ISSUES OF PRIDE AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT SO MUCH MATTER, TO ALL OF US, TO ALL PEOPLE REALLY, BUT CULTURALLY VERY MUCH TO LATIN PEOPLE. THEY'RE ISSUES THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR VERY HARD BECAUSE WITHOUT THOSE RESULTS, ANYTHING ELSE WE DO IS FOR NAUGHT. SO TO OUR FAMILIES AND A BRIGHT FUTURE, WE NEED YOUR HELP. IF YOU ALLOW ME, I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF YOU. ONE OF YOUR HONORARY. THANK YOU. [SPEAKING SPANISH] >>",2015-11-07 17:34:03,1996-08-28,Chicago,Illinois
http://www.c-span.org/video/?74644-1/arkansas-delegation-meeting,Arkansas Delegation Meeting,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. ARE WE PUMPED UP? >> YEAH! >> OH, COME ON, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE GREATEST CAUCUS. ARE WE PUMPED UP? >> YEAH! >> WE -- ARE WE SENDING GEORGE BUSH BACK TO TEXAS? >> YEAH! >> ARE WE SENDING JOHN KERRY TO 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE? >> YEAH! >> BEAUTIFUL. FOLKS, THANK YOU. IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. ARE YOU PUMPED UP? >> YEAH! >> OH, GOD BLESS YOU. LET ME ASK THIS FIRST QUESTION. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR FIRST TWO DAYS UP HERE IN BOSTON? [APPLAUSE] HOW ABOUT THAT LINE-UP OF SPEAKERS, HOBBIT OBAMA LAST NIGHT, WAS ME SOMETHING? >> YEAH! >> YOU KNOW WHY IT'S ALL GOING SO SMOOTH? THE GREATEST CONVENTION CHAIR IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS, BILL RICHARDSON. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, IT'S AN DEPITING TIME. WE'RE HERE IN BOSTON -- EXCITING TIME. WE'RE HERE IN BOSTON. THIS PARTY IS MORE UNIFIED THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN COMING INTO A CONVENTION. IT IS AN EXCITING TIME, WE'RE RARING TO GO AND I REALIZE WE CAN'T WIN WITHOUT THE LARGEST TURNOUT EVER IN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARTY. I NEED YOUR HELP TO HELP ME DO THAT AND I MADE A LOT OF PROMISES 3 1/2 YEARS AGO WHEN I RAN FOR CHAIR OF THIS PARTY AND I'M PROUD TO STAND HERE AND SAY THAT IT WORKED. NAMING THE BILL RICHARDSON, WE CHANGED THE PRIMARY CALENDAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 25 YEARS SO WE CAN ALLOW STATES LIKE ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO TO BE RIGHT UP IN THE FRONT. WE HOSTED THE FIRST SPANISH RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE UNION EVER BEFORE. WE PUT OUR FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN NEW MEXICO, OUR THIRD DEBATE IN ARIZONA. TO SHOW THIS PARTY'S COMMITMENT TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. SO FOLKS, SOMEONE MUST HAVE JUST WALKED IN THE ROOM. [APPLAUSE] THEY DIDN'T JUMP UP HERE WHEN I WALKED IN THE ROOM. FOLKS, I NEED YOUR HELP. THIS IS THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO SAY. THIS PARTY HAS MET ITS COMMITMENT. WHAT WE SAID TO YOU WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED. WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS TOGETHER. WITH YOU I ASK YOU RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THIS ELECTION WILL BE WON OR LOST BY ONE VOTE. THAT PERSON YOU DIDN'T STOP MAY BE THE PERSON THAT DECIDES THIS ELECTION. YOU STOP EVERY PERSON YOU SEE. IF THEY DON'T STOP, YOU TACKLE THEM, YOU GET THEM TO THE POLLS AND GET THEM TO VOTE FOR JOHN KERRY AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT. LET'S GO GET THEM! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> TERRY MCCOULOUGH. SISTERS AND BROTHERS, FOR THE PURPOSES OF AN INTRODUCTION, STATE SENATER FROM THE 20TH DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS IRIS MARTINEZ. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I AM SO HONORED BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? WOMEN ARE MAKING STRIDES. I'M THE FIRST LATINO IN THE STATE SENATE IN ILLINOIS AND I'M VERY PROUD. THANKS TO ALL OF YOU HERE. I'M EXCITED BECAUSE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO IN ILLINOIS, I WAS AWARDED THE HILLARY CLINTON LEADERSHIP AWARD AND THAT'S BECAUSE ALL OF THESE GREAT WOMEN WHO I AM GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. THE STATE OF ILLINOIS HAS GOT SOME GREAT PEOPLE. OUT OF THAT STATE, WE CAME -- SENATOR CLINTON FROM ILLINOIS. AND GUESS WHAT? OUT OF THE STATE SENATE, WE HAVE BARACK OBAMA, SO I'M VERY HAPPY. BUT I KNOW THAT IN THIS ROOM, THIS LADY NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION. SHE'S THE VERY BEST THAT WE HAVE IN THE U.S. SENATE RIGHT NOW. SHE WAS A GREAT FIRST LADY, SOMEONE WHO ALL WOMEN ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD LOVE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. WOW! WHAT IS GREAT, GREAT TURNOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IRIS MARTINEZ, THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SO MANY GREAT LEADERS HERE TODAY AND I AM PROUD AND HONORED TO CALL SO MANY OF THEM MY FRIENDS. I COME TO YOU WITH ALL THE PASSION AND ENERGY THAT WE CAN MUSTER TOGETHER. TO ASK YOU TO DO WHAT I HEARD TERRY MCCOULOUGH PREACHING ABOUT -- WE CANNOT AFFORD -- I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF AMERICAN WE ARE, WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE DISASTEROUS PATH THAT GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY HAVE PUT THIS COUNTRY ON. I WANT TO THANK GLORY MALINA AND LINDA CHAVEZ, AND OF COURSE, TERRY MCCOULOUGH AND WE HAVE CONGRESSMAN ED PASTER, MY DEAR FRIEND HENRY SISNAROS, AND WHERE IS RUAL? THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS AND YEARS OF WORK ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. AND OF COURSE, FROM NEW YORK, I KNOW WE HAVE MARGARITA LOPEZ, ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO I WORK WITH ALL THE TIME. THERE ARE SO MANY OF YOU, I CAN'T GO DOWN THIS PATH OR I'LL GET IN TROUBLE. OH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR MR. PEREZ FROM CONNECTICUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS TOO MUCH FUN. [APPLAUSE] LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS, BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A BUSY SCHEDULE. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WANTING TO COME AND TALK WITH YOU. WASN'T IT GREAT TO HAVE A FUTURE FIRST LADY SPEAKING FLUENT SPANISH LAST NIGHT FROM THE PODIUM OF THE CONVENTION? [APPLAUSE] AND WON'T IT BE GREAT WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ORDER FOR AMERICA TO LEAD THE WORLD YOU CANNOT TURN YOUR BACK ON YOUR FRIENDS IN LATIN AMERICA, YOU MUST REACH OUT A HAND OF SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP. AND WON'T IT BE NICE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE ECONOMIES OF SO MANY COUNTRIES IN THE CARIBBEAN AND IN LATIN AMERICA ARE FUELED BY THE MONEY THAT COMES FROM HARD-WORKING PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND THAT WE MUST STOP THE PREDATORY PRACTICES THAT DENY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SO MANY OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN TO SEND THOSE DOLLARS BACK HOME. AND WON'T BE IT WONDERFUL WHEN WE HAVE A NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE NO PEOPLE MORE COMMITTED TO MILITARY SERVICE, MORE PATRIOTIC AND THEREFORE DESERVE MORE RESPECT THAN LATINO AMERICANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY WITH HONOR AND DISTINCTION. AND WON'T IT BE GREAT AGAIN TO HAVE A VICE PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT WORKING PEOPLE AND KNOWS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THOSE WHO GET UP EVERY DAY AND WORK HARD FOR A LIVING, THAT THE HALLIBURTONS AND THEIR EXECUTIVES CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND DO SO VERY WELL. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. THAT'S WHAT THIS CONVENTION IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT CHARGING US UP, ENERGIZING US, SENDING US OUT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE MESSAGE TO EVERYONE, BECAUSE IN THE 2000 ELECTION, HISPANIC AMERICANS SHOWED THE WAY. THEY REJECTED ZPWB OVERWHELMINGLY. NOW WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND MAKE SURE EVERY VOTE COUNTS AND WE GET THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR. SO I'M HERE TO THANK YOU, TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT, TO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING MY HUSBAND AND SUPPORTING ME, TO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, TO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING JOHN KERRY AND JOHN EDWARDS. BUT, ALL OF THIS ENERGY WILL NOT AMOUNT TO ANYTHING IF WE DON'T REGISTER PEOPLE TO VOTE AND MOTIVATE THEM TO VOTE. SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT EVERYONE YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT MAY SURPRISE YOU TO FIND OUT SOMEONE YOU KNOW WELL, SOMEONE FROM WORK, SOMEONE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, SOMEONE WHO YOU THINK YOU KNOW SOIRBLELY MAY NOT BE REGISTERED -- SOCIALLY MAY NOT BE REGISTERED OR MAYBE NEVER VOTE. SO WE CAN'T ASSUME ANYTHING. I DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANT IT. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THIS ELECTION IS FINALLY OVER. AND I KNOW VERY WELL THAT RIGHT NOW IN CRAWFORD, TEXAS, THEY'RE PLOTTING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY WIN INSTEAD OF US. SO WE GOT TO DO OUR PART. SO LET ME ASK YOU TO DO JUST THREE THINGS. PLEASE, TALK TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW, PARTICIPATE AND REGISTER VOTERS. YOU CAN GO TO MY WEBSITE, DOWNLOAD REGISTRATION FORMS FOR EVERY STATE IN THE UNION. WE HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED 10,000 PEOPLE. I WANT TO REGISTER TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN THIS ELECTION. I WANT TO WIN THIS FOR AMERICA AND THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN. AND THEN FINALLY, MAKE SURE WE MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO VOTE. TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, GET ON THOSE PHONE BANKS AND THAT EMAIL NETWORK, GET OUT THERE AND TURN OUT THE VOTE. AND EVEN IF YOU'RE IN A STATE THAT LOOKS LIKE, YOU KNOW, SENATOR KERRY WILL WINE, LIKE NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA, STILL TURN OUT THE VOTE, BECAUSE WE NEED TO RUN UP A BIG MARGIN. LAST NAME AL GORE GOT 500,000 MORE. I WANT JOHN KERRY TO GET FIVE MILLION MORE AND WE NEED TO GET THEM OUT OF NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY, PLEASE BE PART OF MAKING SURE EVERY VOTE COUNTS. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHERE I VOTE IN NEW YORK, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING THERE CHECKING US IN, THEY'RE LIKE ALL OVER 80 YEARS OLD. THEY EVER WORKED FOR DECADES. THEY DESERVE A REST. WE NEED TO BE THERE, BEING POLL WORKERS AND POLL WATCHERS, TO MAKE SURE THAT NO AMERICANS VOTE IS COUNTED OUT. BECAUSE IF WE COUNT ALL THE VOTES, ESPECIALLY OF HISPANIC AMERICANS, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO? WE'LL MEET AGAIN IN JANUARY AT THE INAUGURATION OF JOHN KERRY FOR PRESIDENT.

SHE KNOWS THE BITTER TASTE OF PREJUDICE. THE BAD MEMORY OF BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. AND WHAT IT IS TO FIGHT AS AN IMMIGRANT IN THIS COUNTRY. [SPEAKING SPANISH] IF YOU BELIEVE THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED A NEED A BETTER EDUCATION, THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER HEALTHCARE, SEND TERESA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IF YOU THINK THAT OUR SENIOR CITIZENS DESERVE A BETTER HEALTH PLAN, A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE, SEND HER TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED AND IMMIGRATION REFORM COMES ABOUT, SEND TERESA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [SPEAKING SPANISH] THE FIRST LADY OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY, TERESA HEINZ KERRY! >> PEACE. PEACE TO YOU. PEACE. THANK YOU FOR THE PEACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I AM HERE TODAY BOTH AS AN EXPRESSION AND AS A HOPE THAT OWL OF US WHO COME TO THIS COUNTRY HOLD AND BURNISH IN OUR HEARTS WHICH IS FOR SOME OF US, THE HOPE OF FREEDOM, THE HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY, THE HOPE FOR A CHANCE TO RUN AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. I TALKED ABOUT WOMEN LAST NIGHT BECAUSE FOR MUCH TOO LONG, THE VALUE, THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF WOMEN HAS NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN ANY MEASURE IN THE GOVERNMENTS. INDEED, IN NUMBERS IN THE G.D.P. OF OUR NATION. AND, YOU KNOW, IN MOST OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS, IF NOT ALL, THE G.D.P. OF THEIR NATIONS INCLUDES THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT THE WORTH, THE VALUE OF WORK THAT IS DONE WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD, WITHIN THE FAMILY MOSTLY BY WOMEN, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY. WHICH IS ABOUT 30% TO 40% OF G.D.P. IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IT'S HUGE. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS SPEND ANY MONEY. IT'S NOT A TAX PLAN, IT'S NOT A TAX BENEFIT. IT'S RESPECT. IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND IT'S DIGNITY. AND WHEN WE DO THAT, WE GIVE THOSE CAREGIVERS A SENSE OF THEMSELVES BEYOND ""THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND BEYOND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO."" IT'S A SENSE OF COLLABORATION, A SENSE OF A JOB WELL DONE. AND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM SOCIETY AND WE NEED TO DO THAT. FOR MOST LATIN PEOPLE, AND I'M ABOUT 7/8 LATIN, AND REALLY MIXED UP. I MEAN, TALKED ABOUT MIXED UP, ITALIAN, PORTUGUESE. I TRY EVERY DAY. AND FRENCH. YOU KNOW THAT FOR US ALL LIFE AROUND THE FAMILY IS THE GLUE, THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, IS MANY AND VERY OFTEN THE PLACE WHERE YOU FIND JOY, WHERE YOU FIND ORDER AND WHERE YOU FIND PAIN TOGETHER. RECENTLY, A COLUMNIST CHIDED ME SAYING THAT I REALLY WASN'T AN IMMIGRANT. BECAUSE ""I CAME FROM A COLONIAL POWER AND I WAS NOT POOR."" HELLO? NEVER HEARD OF REFUGEES AND PEOPLE WHO FLEE FROM DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES? NEVER HEARD OF WAITING FOR TWO YEARS FOR A VISA AS I DID? NEVER HEARD OF BEING SINGLE, ALONE, WORKING IN NEW YORK CITY AT 25 YEARS OLD AND IN A TOUGH JOB, FAR, FAR AWAY FROM YOUR PARENTS IN AFRICA? NEVER HEARD OF RAISING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF COUNSEL AND THE ARMS OF GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND AUNTS WHICH IS WHAT I GREW UP. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS. THE ONES WITH FAMILY ARE VERY FORTUNATE, BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY SHACKLED OR POOR TO KNOW WHAT AN IMMIGRANT LIFE IS. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ALL MORNING TAKING AWAY ALL YOUR SPACE AND TIME FROM OTHER PEOPLE, BUT ONE THING I LEARNED THE OTHER DAY WHICH I HAVE TO ADMIT MY IGNORANCE TO OR ABOUT, I WAS MEETING WITH SEVERAL WOMEN GROUPS IN FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA ON SMALL START-UP BUSINESS -- THE DIFFICULTIES OF CREDIT, BORROWING, ETC. ALL PRACTICAL THINGS. VERY INTERESTING. AND I AM INTERESTED IN THAT. BUT I WAS TALKING TO CUBAN-AMERICANS AS WELL AS OTHER AMERICANS, AND THE ONE THING THIS WOMAN SAID WAS SO INTERESTING. WAS, YOU KNOW, CUBANS REALLY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS HISPANICS. OH. AND THEN I WENT HOME AND I PHOTOGRAPHED THAT. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE STORIES ONE HEARS, THAT THE CUBANS GO WITH THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE, AND THE OTHERS WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, I SAID THIS IS SUCH TUMMY ROT, YOU KNOW? WHY? BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THE CONCLUSION THAT I CAME TO AND WHY A LOT OF CUBANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF MORE OF MY AGE THAT LOST -- LOST EARLY, NOT THEIR CHILDREN, IS THAT WHAT THEY LOST AS I DID WHEN MY COUNTRY IN MOZAMBIQUE BECAME A COMMUNIST COUNTRY AND MY PARENTS LOST EVERYTHING AT AGE 73 AND HAD TO LEAVE, IS THAT WHEN YOU LOSE THAT, NOT BEING ABLE TO GO BACK, IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SCAR. IT'S A TERRIBLE WOUND, AND SO WHEN WE HEAR OF CUBANS BEING VERY ANGRY, BEING VERY HOT, EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE ISSUES AS OPPOSED TO OTHER LATSEN AMERICANS WHO LEFT FOR OTHER REASONS, I NOW UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I REMEMBER. I STILL FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT MY COUNTRY TOO. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE TO EVERY DAY. HAVING SAID THAT, I SAY THIS FOR THE CUBAN COMMUNITY. WHAT WE HAVE MANY COMMON AND THE HISTORY WE HAVE TO BUILD FOR THE FUTURE IS SO MUCH MORE EXCITING THAN ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT OR HURTFUL OR THE VICIVE RIGHT NOW AND THIS'S WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT FROM NOW ON, THE FUTURE. SO, ARE THERE ANY BRAZILIANS HERE, FOR PETE'S SAKES? I KNOW -- [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] ANYWAY, YOU SEE THIS IS A WHOLE BIG FAMILY. AND WE HAVE A LOT -- A LOT TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN. AS WOW KNOW, I HAVE THREE BOYS. MY LATE HUSBAND AND I HAVE A GRANDCHILD. AND MY OLDEST SON IS TEACHING MY GRANDCHILD ALL THE PORTUGUESE SONGS, NURSERY RHYMES, WORDS THAT I TAUGHT HIM WHEN HE WAS LITTLE. AND IT'S SO CUTE TO SEE THAT. AND I'M JUST PRAYING THAT WHEN THINGS QUIET DOWN, I WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP AND TEACH EVEN MORE AND MORE GRANDCHILDREN. SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, THE ISSUES OF ACCESS, THE ISSUES OF LOANS AN CREDIT, THE ISSUES OF DIGNITY, OF RESPECT, OF INCLUSION, OF OPPORTUNITY,, THE ISSUES OF PRIDE AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT SO MUCH MATTER, TO ALL OF US, TO ALL PEOPLE REALLY, BUT CULTURALLY VERY MUCH TO LATIN PEOPLE. THEY'RE ISSUES THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR VERY HARD BECAUSE WITHOUT THOSE RESULTS, ANYTHING ELSE WE DO IS FOR NAUGHT. SO TO OUR FAMILIES AND A BRIGHT FUTURE, WE NEED YOUR HELP. IF YOU ALLOW ME, I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF YOU. ONE OF YOUR HONORARY. THANK YOU. [SPEAKING SPANISH] >>",2015-11-07 17:34:20,1996-08-26,Chicago,Illinois

THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES -- >>> I WAS ON THE GULF COAST WITH MY FAMILY FOR A SHORT VACATION ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO WHEN I WAS CONTACTED BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF SENATOR CRUZ EXPRESSING HIS DESIRE TO SPEND THIS HISTORIC DAY IN HIS LIFE AT LIBERTY UNIVERSITY. I WAS THRILLED AND HONORED HE HELD LIBERTY IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM. WE IMMEDIATELY SAW THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WOULD BEEN SCHEDULED TO SPEAK AND INFORMED THEM THAT SENATOR WOULD BE SHARING THE STAGE WITH THE GOVERNOR THIS MORNING. WE ALSO OFFERED TO MOVE THE SENATOR'S SPEECH TO THE LEADER IN THE AFTERNOON AS A SECOND OPTION. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE GRACIOUSLY EXPLAINED THE GOVERNOR HAD AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE HE WANTED TO DELIVER TO YOU, THE STUDENTS OF LIBERTY UNIVERSITY AND HE PREFERRED TO DO IT ON ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT THESE DISTRACTIONS. WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S VISIT AND RESCHEDULE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOUR WARM RECEPTION WHEN HE SPOKE HERE I STEER WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN HIS DECISION TO CHOOSE TO COME HERE AND ADDRESS YOU FIRST. AS YOU KNOW, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY DOES NOT SUPPORT OR OPPOSE CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE AND THAT SENATOR'S APPEARANCE SHOULDN'T BE INTERPRETED BY ANY AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF HIS CANDIDACY. WE ARE PROUD WE CAN OFFER A PLATFORM OF LIBERTY WHERE OUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO HEAR REGULARLY ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES AND IDEAS FROM PUBLIC SERVANTS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. BORN INTO A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY AFTER HIS FATHER HAD ESCAPED CUBA DURING THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION IN 1957, HIS CALL TO PUBLIC SERVICE WAS INSPIRED BY HIS OWN FAMILY PURSUIT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AFTER GRADUATING FROM PRINCETON AND THEN HARVARD LAW SCHOOL COMMITTEE BECAME THE FIRST HISPANIC TO EVERY CLERK FOR THE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. [CHEERING] AND IN 2003 BECAME THE SOLICITOR GENERAL OF TEXAS AND THE YOUNGEST IN THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME AND LEFT AFTER BECOMING THE LONGEST-SERVING SOLICITOR GENERAL IN TEXAS FOR THE UNPRECEDENTED SERIES OF LANDMARK NATIONAL VICTORIES BEFORE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. ELECTED TO THE SENATE FOLLOWING THE TREMENDOUS WAY SUCCESSFUL GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN THE ""WASHINGTON POST"" CALLED IT THE BIGGEST UPSET OF 2012, HE QUICKLY BECAME RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE STRONGEST MOST PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE LEADERS IN THE COUNTRY AND WHILE MANY HAVE BEEN TO THE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO COMPROMISE, TED HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW VOICES FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE FREEDOMS OUR FOREFATHERS FOUGHT AND DIED TO SECURE IT IS EASY TO LEAD THE CHARGE WHEN YOU HAVE AN ARMY BUT I'VE WATCHED THE SENATOR STAND ON THE PRINCIPLE WHY ONLY A HANDFUL OF SENATORS ARE STANDING BEHIND HIM. TED CRUZ HAS GONE AGAINST THE TIDE AND HAS TAKEN THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED AND HAS PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE A MAN OF GREAT CHARACTER. TODAY HE ARRIVES WITH HIS WIFE AND THEIR TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS ALL OF WHOM WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE WITH US TODAY SO PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING BACK TO LIBERTY, SENATOR TED CRUZ. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THANK YOU SO MUCH, PRESIDENT. GOD BLESS LIBERTY UNIVERSITY. [CHEERING] IEM THRILLED TO JOIN YOU TODAY OF THE LARGEST CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD. TODAY I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. IMAGINE YOUR PARENTS WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN. IMAGINE A LITTLE GIRL GROWING UP IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE. DURING WORLD WAR II DAUGHTER OF HYDROGEN AND ITALIAN CATHOLIC FAMILIES WORKING CLASS, HER UNCLE RAN NUMBERS IN WILMINGTON AND SHE GREW UP WITH DOZENS OF COUSINS BECAUSE HER MOM WAS THE SECOND YOUNGEST OF 17 KIDS. SHE HAD A DIFFICULT FATHER, A MAN WHO DRANK FAR TOO MUCH AND FRANKLY DIDN'T THINK THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE EDUCATED. AND YET THIS GIRL PRETTY AND SHY WAS DRIVEN AND WAS INQUISITIVE AND SHE BECAME THE FIRST PERSON IN HER FAMILY EVER TO GO TO COLLEGE. IN 1956, MY MOM A LOT GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN MATH AND BECAME A PIONEERING COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN THE 1950s AND 1960s. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE A TEENAGE BOY NOT MUCH YOUNGER THAN MANY OF YOU HERE TODAY GROWING UP IN CUBA. BLACK HAIR, SKINNY AS A RAIL. [LAUGHTER] INVOLVED IN THE STUDENT COUNCIL AND YET CUBA WASN'T AT A PEACEFUL TIME AND THEY WERE CORRUPT AND THIS TEENAGE BOY JOINED A REVOLUTION. HE JOINED A REVOLUTION AND BEGAN FIGHTING WITH OTHER TEENAGERS TO FREE CUBA FROM THE DICTATOR. THIS WAY AT AGE 17 FINDS HIMSELF THROWN IN PRISON, FINDS HIMSELF TORTURED, BEATEN AND THEN AT AGE 18 HE FLEES CUBA AND COMES TO AMERICA. IMAGINE FOR A SECOND OF THE HOPE THAT WASN'T HIS HEART AS HE RODE THE FERRY BOAT AND GOT ON A GREYHOUND BUS TO HEAD TO AUSTIN TEXAS. TO BEGIN YOU BEGIN WORKING WASHING DISHES MAKING 50 CENTS AN HOUR COMING TO THE ONE LAND ON EARTH THAT HAS WELCOMED SO MANY MILLIONS. WHEN MY DAD CAME TO AMERICA IN 1957 HE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR HIM. IMAGINE A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE LIVING TOGETHER IN THE 1970s, NEITHER ONE OF THEM HAS A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS. THEY HAVE A LITTLE BOY AND THEY ARE BOTH DRINKING FAR TOO MUCH. THEY ARE LIVING A FAST LIFE. WHEN I WAS THREE, MY FATHER DECIDED TO LEAVE MY MOTHER AND ME. WE WERE LIVING IN CALVARY AT THE TIME AND HE GOT ON A PLANE AND FLEW BACK TO TEXAS IF HE DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE MARRIED ANYMORE. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A FATHER TO HIS 3-YEAR-OLD SON. YET WHEN HE WAS IN HOUSTON, A FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE INVITED HIM TO THE BAPTIST CHURCH AND BEAR MY FATHER GAVE HIS LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST. [APPLAUSE] AND GOD TRANSFORMED HIS HEART AND HE DROVE TO THE AIRPORT, DOT A. PLANE TICKET AND FLEW BACK TO BE WITH MY MOTHER AND ME. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WONDER IF FAITH IS REAL. I CAN TELL YOU IN MY FAMILY THERE ISN'T A SECOND OF DOUBT BECAUSE WERE IT NOT FOR THE TRANSFORMATIVE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST, I WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED BY A SINGLE MOTHER WITHOUT MY FATHER IN THE HOUSE. IMAGINE ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL LIVING IN AFRICA IN KENYA AND NIGERIA. THAT'S A DIVERSE CROWD. [LAUGHTER] COMING BACK TO CALIFORNIA -- [CHEERING] THE PARENTS WHO HAD BEEN MISSIONARIES IN AFRICA RAISED HER ON THE CENTRAL COAST AND SHE STARTS A BUSINESS MAKING BREAD. SHE CALLS IT HEIDI'S BAKERY. SHE AND HER BROTHER BAKE THOUSANDS OF LOAVES OF BREAD AND THEY GO TO THE LOCAL APPLE ORCHARD WHERE THEY SELL THE BREAD TO PEOPLE COMING TO PICK APPLES. SHE GOES ON TO A CAREER IN BUSINESS EXCELLING AND RISING TO THE HIGHEST PINNACLES, AND THEN HEIDI BECOMES MY WIFE AND MY VERY BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] HEIDI BECOMES AN INCREDIBLE MOTHER TO OUR TWO PRECIOUS LITTLE GIRLS, CAROLINE AND KATHRYN, THE JOYS AND LOVE OF OUR LIVES. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE ANOTHER TEENAGE BOY BEING RAISED IN HOUSTON, HEARING STORIES FROM HIS DAD ABOUT PRISON AND TORTURE IN CUBA. HEARING STORIES ABOUT HOW FRAGILE LIBERTY IS. BEGINNING TO STUDY THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, LEARNING ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE PROTECTIONS WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT PROTECTS THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN. EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES AT HOME IN THE MID-80s THE CRISIS AND THE PARENTS BUSINESS GO BANKRUPT. HEADING OFF TO SCHOOL OVER A THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM HOME IN A PLACE WHERE HE KNEW NOBODY, WHERE HE WAS ALONE AND SCARED AND HIS PARENTS GOING THROUGH BANKRUPTCY MEANT THERE WAS NO FINANCIAL SUPPORT AT HOME SO AT THE AGE OF 17, THEY WENT TO GET TO JOBS TO HELP PAY HIS WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. IT TOOK OVER $100,000 IN SCHOOL LOANS THAT I SUSPECT A LOT OF YOU CAN RELATE TO. LOANS THAT I WILL POINT OUT I JUST PAID OFF A FEW YEARS AGO. [CHEERING] THESE ARE ALL OF OUR STORIES. THESE ARE WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS. AND YET, FOR SO MANY AMERICANS, THE PROMISE OF AMERICA SEEMS MORE AND MORE DISTANT. IT IS THE PROMISE OF AMERICA, THE IDEA THAT A THE REVOLUTIONARY IDEA OF THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED UPON WHICH IS THAT OUR RIGHTS DON'T COME FROM MEN. AND AS THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE CONSTITUTION AS THOMAS JEFFERSON PUT IT IT IS TO SERVE AS THE CHAIN TO BUY IT AT THE MISTRESS OF GOVERNMENT -- THE MISCHIEF OF GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WHAT HAS ENABLED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME TO AMERICA WITH NOTHING BUT TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING. AND THEN THE AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM THAT HAS MADE THIS NATION A CLARION VOICE FOR FREEDOM IN THE WORLD A SHINING CITY ON A HILL. THAT IS THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS NATION AND INDISPENSABLE AND UNIQUE NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YET SO MANY FEAR THAT TODAY THAT PROMISE IS UNATTAINABLE AND THAT IT IS SLIPPING AWAY FROM OUR HANDS. I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU THIS MORNING ABOUT REIGNITING THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. 240 YEARS AGO ON THIS DAY, A 38-YEAR-OLD LAWYER NAMED PATRICK HENRY -- [CHEERING] -- STOOD UP JUST A HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA -- [CHEERING] -- AND SAID GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO IMAGINE, IMAGINE MILLIONS OF COURAGEOUS CONFIRM IT IS ALL ACROSS AMERICA RISING UP TOGETHER TO SAY IN UNISON THE DAY OF OUR LIBERTY -- WE DEMAND OUR LIBERTY. [APPLAUSE] TODAY, ROUGHLY HALF OF BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN ARE NOT VOTING. THEY ARE STAYING HOME. IMAGINE INSTEAD BILLIONS OF PEOPLE OF FAITH ALL ACROSS AMERICA COMING OUT TO THE POLLS AND VOTING. [APPLAUSE] TODAY MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SCARED, WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE, WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE WILL HOLD. IMAGINE ALIENS OF YOUNG PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER AND STANDING TOGETHER SAYING THAT WE WILL STAND FOR LIBERTY. THINK JUST HOW DIFFERENT THE WORLD WOULD BE. THE IMAGINE INSTEAD OF ECONOMIC STAGNATION, BOOMING ECONOMIC PROGRESS. [APPLAUSE] INSTA THAT SMALL BUSINESSES GOING OUT OF BUSINESS IN RECORD NUMBERS, IMAGINE SMALL BUSINESS IS GROWING AND PROSPERING AND IMAGINE YOUNG PEOPLE COMING OUT OF SCHOOL WITH FOUR, FIVE, SIX JOB OFFERS. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE THRIVING ON THE GOVERNMENT AS REGULATORS AND TAX COLLECTORS ARE KEPT AT BAY AND MORE OPPORTUNITY IS CREATED. IMAGINE AMERICA FINALLY BECOMING ENERGY SELF-SUFFICIENT WITH MILLIONS OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS CREATED. [APPLAUSE] FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED OBAMACARE INTO LAW. WITHIN HOURS, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY WENT TO COURT FILING A LAWSUIT TO STOP BACK BILL. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF THE MILLIONS FORCED INTO PART-TIME WORK AND SKYROCKETING HEALTH-INSURANCE PREMIUMS, IMAGINE IMAGINE AND 2017 A NEW PRESIDENT SIGNING LEGISLATION REPEALING EVERY WORD OF OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE HEALTH CARE REFORM THAT KEEPS GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DOCTORS AND MAKES HEALTH-INSURANCE VERSATILE AND AFFORDABLE. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF THE TAX CODE THAT IMPOSES BURDENS ON FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET, IMAGINE A SIMPLE FLAT TAX. [CHEERING] THAT LETS EVERY AMERICAN FELL OUT OF HIS OR HER TAX IS ON A POSTCARD. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE ABOLISHING THE IRS. [CHEERING] INSTEAD OF THE LAWLESSNESS AND THE PRESIDENT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXECUTIVE AMNESTY, IMAGINE A PRESIDENT IS FINALLY, FINALLY SECURES THE BORDERS. [CHEERING] AND A MATCHING A LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT WELCOMES AND CELEBRATES THOSE THAT COME TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WAGES AN ASSAULT ON OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY THAT GOES AFTER HOBBY LOBBY AND THE SISTERS OF THE POOR AND AFTER LIBERTY UNIVERSITY IMAGINE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT STANDS FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF EVERY AMERICAN. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS TO UNDERMINE OUR VALUES AND IMAGINE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WERE TO DEFEND THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. [APPLAUSE] AND TO UPHOLD THE SACRAMENT OF MARRIAGE. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS TO UNDERMINE THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND TO BAN OUR AMMUNITION -- IMAGINE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT PROTECTS THEIR RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS OF ALL LAW ABIDING AMERICANS -- [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF A GOVERNMENT THAT SEIZES YOUR E-MAILS AND CELL PHONES, IMAGINE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF EVERY AMERICAN. [CHEERING] INSTEAD OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT SEEK TO DICTATE SCHOOL CURRICULUM THROUGH COMMON CORE. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE REPEALING EVERY WORD OF COMMON CORE. IMAGINE EMBRACING SCHOOL CHOICE AS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF THE NEXT GENERATION. [APPLAUSE] THAT EVERY SINGLE CHILD, REGARDLESS OF RACE, ETHNICITY, WEALTH OR ZIP CODE, EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA HAS THE RIGHT TO A QUALITY EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT'S TRUE FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE WHETHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR CHARTER SCHOOLS OR CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS OR -- EVERY CHILD. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF A PRESIDENT WHO BOYCOTTS PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU, IMAGINE A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP OLD JETTA -- UNAPOLOGETICALLY WITH ISRAEL. [CHEERING] INSTEAD OF A PRESIDENT THAT SEEKS TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES IMAGINE A PRESIDENT THAT SAYS I WILL HONOR THE CONSTITUTION AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL IRAN BE ALLOWED TO ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE A PRESIDENT THAT SAYS WE WILL STAND UP AND DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL CALL IT BY ITS NAME. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL DEFEND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF THESE SEEM DIFFICULT AND INDEED TO SOME DAY MAY SEEM UNIMAGINABLE JUST IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY IMAGINE IN 1775 U. AND I SITTING THERE IN RICHMOND LISTENING TO PATRICK HENRY SAY GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH. IMAGINE 1776 AND WE ARE WATCHING THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE STAND TOGETHER AND PLEDGE THEIR LIVES AND THEIR SACRED HONOR TO IGNITE THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. IMAGINE IT WAS 1777 AND WE WERE WATCHING GENERAL WASHINGTON AS HE LOST BATTLE AFTER BATTLE IN THE FREEZING COLD AS HIS SOLDIERS WITH NO SHOES WERE DYING FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM AGAINST THE MOST POWERFUL ARMY IN THE WORLD. THAT SEEMED UNIMAGINABLE. IMAGINE IT'S 1933 AND WE WERE LISTENING TO PRESIDENT FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT TOLD AMERICA IN THE TIME OF CRUSHING DEPRESSION AND THE TIME OF A GATHERING STORM ABROAD THAT WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF. IMAGINE IT'S 1979 AND YOU AND I WERE LISTENING TO RONALD REAGAN. [APPLAUSE] AND HE WAS TELLING US THAT WE WOULD CUT MARGINAL TAX RATES FROM 70% ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 28%, THAT WE WOULD GO FROM CRUSHING STOOD ASIAN TO BOOMING ECONOMIC GROWTH TO MILLIONS LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY AND PROSPERITY AND THE VERY DAY THAT HE WAS SWORN IN, OUR HOSTAGES LANGUISHING IN IRAN WOULD BE RELEASED AND THAT WITHIN A DECADE WE WOULD WIN THE COLD WAR AND TEAR THE BERLIN WALL TO THE GROUND. ABOUT WOULD HAVE SEEMED UNIMAGINABLE BUT YET WITH THE GRACE OF GOD THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. [APPLAUSE] FROM THE DAWN OF THE COUNTRY AT EVERY STAGE OF AMERICA HAS IN JOY THE BLESSING. OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN WE FACE AN IMPOSSIBLE ODDS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE. COMPARED TO THAT, REPEALING OBAMACARE AND ABOLISHING THE IRS ISN'T ALL THAT TOUGH. THE AMERICAN POWER OF THE PEOPLE WHEN WE RISE UP AND STAND FOR LIBERTY DOES NO BOUNDS. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE READY TO JOIN A GRASSROOTS ARMY ACROSS THIS NATION COMING TOGETHER AND STANDING UP FOR LIBERTY I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO BREAK A RULE HERE TODAY AND TAKE OUT YOUR CELL PHONES AND STOOD THE WORD CONSTITUTION TO THE NUMBER 33733. YOU CAN ALSO TEXT IMAGINE. WE ARE VERSATILE. ONCE AGAIN, CONSTITUTION 233733. GOD'S BLESSING HAS BEEN ON AMERICA FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS NATION AND I BELIEVE GOD IS NOT DONE WITH AMERICA'S YET. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE IN YOU AND THE POWER OF MILLIONS OF COURAGEOUS CONSERVATIVES RISING UP TO REIGNITE THE PROMISE OF AMERICA AND THAT IS WHY TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING THAT I'M I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] IT IS THE TIME FOR TRUTH. IT IS THE TIME TO RECLAIM THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] I AM HONORED TO STAND WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU COURAGEOUS CONSERVATIVES AS WE COME TOGETHER TO RECLAIM THE PROMISE OF AMERICA AND THE MANDATES AND HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE STAND TOGETHER FOR LIBERTY. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THIS IS OUR FIGHT. THE ANSWER WILL NOT COME FROM WASHINGTON. IT WILL COME ONLY FROM THE MEN AND WOMEN AND DEVELOPERS OF LIBERTY AND PEOPLE WHO RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION IT WILL ONLY COME AS IT HAS DURING EVERY OTHER TIME OF CHALLENGE IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STAND TOGETHER AND SAY WE WILL GIVE BACK TO THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. WE WILL GET BACK AND RESTORE THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL THAT IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

I WANT TO RECOGNIZE MY MOTHER AND FATHER, THE GOOD RIDGES, WHO [INDISCERNIBLE] THEY HELPED US PULL THIS OFF. I AM LUCKY IN MY IN-LAWS. MY MOM AND DAD, WHO ARE OVER HERE. . WE BOTH HAVE STRONG, TOUGH MOTHERS. IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO MEET MY MOM AND DAD I HOPE YOU'LL MAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT. FOUR YEARS AGO AND THE LAST PRIMARY SEASON WE HAD A LOT OF CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SERIOUS, CREDIBLE CANDIDATES. IF GOVERNOR BUSH WERE TO BECOME A CANDIDATE HE IS THE ONE PERSON ANTIDOTE FOR THAT PROBLEM. HIS FAMILY HAS DISTINGUISHED ITSELF IN SERVICE TO OUR NATION. GOVERNOR BUSH WAS A SUCCESSFUL, FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE TWO-TERM GOVERNOR OF A BIG AND DIVERSE STATE. EDUCATION REFORM AND INNOVATION WAS A SIGNATURE ISSUE WHILE GOVERNOR. I APPRECIATE GOVERNOR BUSH HAS BEEN A LEADING VOICE ON FIXING AND MODERNIZING OUR BROKEN INNER RATION -- BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. JOIN ME IN WELCOMING GOVERNOR JEB BUSH. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS. THIS IS MY INAUGURAL VOYAGE AT A HOUSE PARTY THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS AT LEAST. [LAUGHTER] I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR COMING. YOU COULD BE DOING OTHER THINGS. IT IS FRIDAY NIGHT. IM HUMBLED YOU WOULD COME TO HEAR ME TALK AND TO ASK ME QUESTIONS AND LET ME HAVE IT. BEFORE I START I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF. PEOPLE DO KNOW ME AS GEORGE AND BARBARA'S BOY. AND GEORGE W'S BROTHER PRE-ALL OF THAT I AM PROUD OF. WHEN I WAS BORN IN MIDLAND, TEXAS, MY EYES OPEN AND THERE I WAS CRYING FOR OXYGEN, AND BARBARA BUSH WAS THERE. I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME BUT I WON THE LOTTERY. [LAUGHTER] I AM BLESSED AND SO MANY WAYS. IF I'M GOING TO GO BEYOND THE CONSIDERATION OF RUNNING I HAVE TO SHARE MY HEART AND TELL MY LIFE STORY AND GIVE PEOPLE THE SENSE THAT I HAVE IDEAS TO HELP PEOPLE RISE UP. MY LIFE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY MY WIFE OF 41 YEARS BREED I MET HER IN MEXICO WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS OLD AND IN EXCHANGE PROGRAM. I FELL MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER. HEAD OVER HERE HEELS IN LOVE. IT ALLOWED ME TO -- I WANTED TO MARRY HER. I HAD TO FIGURE A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING. IT IS HARD TO MAKE THE PITCH WITHOUT HAVING WHEREWITHAL TO DO IT. I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL IN TWO YEARS AND STARTED WORKING, I WORKED ALL OF MY ADULT LIFE WITHOUT MISSING MORE THAN A WEEK OFF. THAT EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN PART OF MY LIFE. I SIGNED THE FRONT SIDE OF A PAYCHECK. I THINK WE NEED MORE PEOPLE WITH PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THAT ENDEAVOR, THE HEARTBEAT OF OUR COUNTRY, IN WASHINGTON DC . WE SEE THIS OPPRESSIVE RULES ON TOP OF OLDER RULES THAT CREATE COMPLEXITY THAT MAKES IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE RISING INCOME. I WAS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA, WHICH I RECOMMEND HIGHLY, FOR ANY YOUNG PEOPLE. TWO PIECES OF ADVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN POLITICS, RUN FOR GOVERNOR, DON'T SETTLE FOR SOMETHING NOT NEARLY AS INTERESTING, AND RUN AGAINST A BAD CANDIDATE IF YOU CAN. IT IS EASIER. [LAUGHTER] OR DON'T RUN AGAINST A GUY WHO NEVER LOST. BETTER TO HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN. I HAD A CHANCE TO SERVE. WHEN I WAS A CANDIDATE IN 1998, I HAVE THESE VIEWS ABOUT EDUCATION. I THINK THIS HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE START FIXING PROBLEMS IN WASHINGTON. MY VIEWS DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH WHEN I RAN BETWEEN 1994 AND 1998. I WANTED TO TAKE THESE DEEPLY HELD VIEWS OF TURNING THE SYSTEM UPSIDE DOWN AND SHAKING IT SO IT COULD BECOME MORE STUDENT CENTERED. I WENT TO VISIT 250 SCHOOLS. IT WAS A SPECTACULAR EXPERIENCE. PEOPLE SAW ME FOR WHO I WAS. I SHOWED MY HEART. I STOOD MY GROUND. I LEARNED A LOT. I LEARNED TO SHARE THE NEED TO REFORM OUR SCHOOLS AND A HUMAN CONTACTS. IT GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO DO IT. IN FLORIDA WE HAVE LED THE NATION IN MANY CATEGORIES IN TERMS OF RISING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, PARTICULARLY KIDS AND POVERTY THAT ARE ALWAYS LEFT BEHIND. THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER EXCUSE. WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT ANYMORE. OUR COUNTRY IS 56 PERCENT MAJORITY MINORITY. 57% FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH QUALIFIED. WE HAD A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE POOR, WHICH IS FINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE EVERY CHANCE TO RISE UP IF WE GET IT RIGHT. CHANGING THESE BIG THINGS, I HAD A CHANCE TO DO AS GOVERNOR, WE CREATED THE FIRST STATEWIDE VOUCHER PROGRAM, THE INCREASE IN CHARTER SCHOOLS, WE ELIMINATED SOCIAL PROMOTION IN THIRD GRADE. WE ADVANCED LITERACY TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN, THE GAPS DIDN'T START EARLY. WE HIT IT ON ALL CYLINDERS. FLORIDA DID SEE BIG GAINS. WE ALSO BUILD A BETTER BUSINESS CLIMATES. I CUT TAXES TO $19 BILLION. WE REDUCE THE STATE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE BY 13,000 WE COULD ON THE INTERESTS IN OUR STATE, THE TRIAL BAR, OR THE FOLKS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THE WORKER'S COMP. SYSTEM. WE HAD 1.3 MILLION NET NEW JOBS DURING MY EIGHT YEARS. I DIDN'T DO IT. I WAS PART OF THE 13,000 DECREASED IN JOBS. I WAS STATE GOVERNOR. THE PRIVATE SECTOR DID A LOT BETTER. WE WERE THE ONLY STATE WHO WENT TO AAA. WE WERE FRUGAL. GOVERNMENT DIDN'T GROW FASTER THAN PEOPLE'S INCOME. THEY CALLED MEET VITO CORLEONE. MAYBE I CALLED MYSELF THAT. [LAUGHTER] WE'VE VETOED SOMETHING LIKE 2500 SEPARATE LINE ITEMS IN THE BUDGET TO CREATE DISCIPLINE AND FOCUS ON HOW THE BUDGET WORKS. THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY RESPONDED. MY POINT IS, YOU CAN BE A CONSERVATIVE, YOU CAN DO IT WITH JOY IN YOUR HEARTS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ANGRY ABOUT THIS. DO IT IN A WAY THAT DRAWS PEOPLE TOWARDS OUR CAUSE AND YOU CAN WIN IN A PURPLE STATE. IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO WIN . WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND REACH OUT TO PEOPLE OF EVERY WALK OF LIFE, NOT WITH A DIVISIVE MESSAGE, ONE THAT IS UNIFIED. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO RISE UP. EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE GOD-GIVEN BILLS TO ACHIEVE OUR OWN SUCCESS. IF I GET BEYOND THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS, I BELIEVE THIS COUNTRY IS ON A PRECIPICE OF THE GREATEST TIME TO BE ALIVE. IF WE HAD A STRATUS THEY -- STRATEGY OF HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH WERE INCOME BEGINS TO RISE NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP THIS COUNTRY. WE SHOULD REFLECT ON OUR GREATNESS, NOT JUST OUR HISTORY, BUT OUR INNOVATIVE SPIRIT AND ABILITY TO DO THINGS THAT THE FIVE IMAGINATION OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE SHOULD BE OPTIMISTIC AND BEGIN TO GOVERN TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS SO EVERYBODY GETS OPTIMISTIC. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT TIME TO BE YOUNG. I WOULD RATHER BE YOUR AGE THAN MINE. [LAUGHTER] I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THIS IS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. YES? >> I APPRECIATE YOUR PRINCIPLED STANCE ON COMMON CORE. WHO DO YOU -- WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION OF COMMON CORE? >> THIS IS A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF EDUCATION. I OPPOSE THAT. THE BEST WAY TO DISPROVE THAT IS FOR THE REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT IN CONGRESS NOW. IN THAT ACT, IN THE REAUTHORIZATION, THERE IS A PROVISION THAT SAYS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH STANDARDS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CONTENT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CURRICULUM. COMMON CORE STANDARDS -- [APPLAUSE] COMMON CORE STANDARDS ARE HIGHER STANDARDS THAN THE STANDARDS OF MANY STATES. AS THEY HAVE BEEN EMBRACED, SOME STATES DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEM, FINE. THEY SHOULD JUST HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS. CALL THEM SUNSHINE STATE STANDARDS. CALL THEM WHAT YOU WANT. THE FACT IS WE HAVE DUMBED DOWN EVERYTHING OVER A LONG TIME. THIS IS NOT A NEW THING. AS WE HAVE DUMBED IT DOWN AND HAVE THE POLITICALLY -- POLITICALLY CORRECT CURRICULUM WE HAVE 80% GRADUATION RATE IN HIGH SCHOOL. THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. IT HAS GOTTEN BETTER. A THIRD OF OUR KIDS ARE COLLEGE AND CAREER READY. WHO IS FOOLING WHOM? WE ARE GIVING PEOPLE A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS YOU ARE A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. THEN THEY GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND FIND OUT SORRY, YOU HAVE TO RETAKE HIGH SCHOOL READING AND HIGH SCHOOL MATH. WHO IS FOOLING WHOM? ARE WE GOING TO BE A GREAT NATION THAT HAS HIGHER ASPIRATIONS FOR PEOPLE ARE WE GOING TO SAY IT IS SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT, KIDS IN POVERTY CAN'T LEARN. TOO MUCH BUREAUCRACY. WE SHOULD PUT AWAY THE EXCUSES AND RECOGNIZE KIDS HAVE THE TALENT TO DO THIS. THEY HAVE THE TALENT. WE HAVE THE TEACHERS TO DO THIS. AN ELEMENT THAT IS IMPORTANT AS HIGH STANDARDS. HIGH STANDARDS MATTERS A LOT. I HATE THE POISONOUS ENVIRONMENT THAT COMMON CORE HAS BROUGHT BECAUSE THE WE OUGHT TO BE FOCUSING ON IS HIGHER STANDARDS, ACCURATE IT SAYS IT'S, ROBUST ACCOUNTABILITY, SCHOOL CHOICE, ADVANCING THE CAUSE OF RISING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENTS, AND THAT IS MY PASSION. I AM ALL IN ON THAT. AM NOT BACKING DOWN BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THIS, WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT THIS. I HAVE TIRE MARKS DOING THIS. [LAUGHTER] THEY CAN TELL YOU THE STORIES OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE. IT WASN'T EASY. THE UNIONS, I TRIED TO FIND COMMON GROUND. WE COULDN'T. I WAS THEIR POSTER CHILD IN THE REELECTION. THE CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT THESE BIGGER IDEAS. I WON REELECTION BUT IT IS HARD TO GET THROUGH THESE THINGS. YOU HAVE TO STAY THE COURSE AND MAKE IT WORK. FLORIDA GAINS ARE REAL. NO ONE CAN DENY THEM. THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT. >> YOU TALK ABOUT IOWA LEADING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. WHICH STATES ARE LACKING? [INAUDIBLE] >> I HAVE BEEN ON A LOT OF BUSINESS TO AURIZON MINES REAL-LIFE -- TOURS IN MY REAL LIFE. AGRICULTURE IN GENERAL DOESN'T DO THE RECOGNITION OF HOW INNOVATIVE AND HOW TECHNOLOGICALLY DRIVEN IT IS, WHETHER IT IS THE BIOTECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS FOR HAVING CROPS GROW IN DROUGHT RESISTANT WAY, OR THE YIELD INCREASE, FARMERS AND INCREASE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY TENFOLD IN'S 19 THE. IT IS AN AMAZING STORY. TECHNOLOGY NORMALLY MEANS THIS AREA AROUND HERE, SO THE NEW >> TECHNOLOGY IS ACROSS THE BOARD IN EVERY SECTOR. THERE ARE GREAT COMPANIES IN FLORIDA. I FEEL COMPELLED AS A FORMER GOVERNOR TO TO TO MY IMPORTANT -- TO TOOT MY OWN HORN. THERE IS INCREDIBLE STUFF HAPPENING. I WENT TO SEE THE GUYS THAT WHEN GOOGLE. -- THAT RUN GOOGLE. HE PULLED UP HIS COMPUTER INTERMEDIATE -- AND SHOWED ME THE UBER CARS RUNNING AND IT SHOWED ME THE PEOPLE VIOLATING LAW AT MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. WE HAVE A CLOSET THAT PROHIBIT THESE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES. EVENTUALLY THOSE WILL GO AWAY. WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY AND INNOVATION. THE QUESTION IS -- ARE OUR CHILDREN GOING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY IT? OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE FIXED SO THAT WE START BUILDING FOR WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. IT IS A BENEFIT, RATHER THAN OUR DETRIMENT. YES MA'AM. ARE YOU A REPORTER? >> I AM, SIR. >> LATER. [LAUGHTER] >> CITIZEN OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. >> WE WILL SPEAK WITH YOU GUYS LATER. >> HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS ENSURING OUR ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE SECURITY? >>JEB>> THE QUESTION IS HOW WOULD YOU BALANCE THE ANSWERS TO BOTH? THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE NARROWED TO ONE SPECIFIC FIELD ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO, WHICH IS BASIC RESEARCH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT HAVE A VENTURE-CAPITAL ARM, PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT WAS. -- WE SAW HOW BAD IT WAS. TO DISRUPT THE ADVANCES OF IT TECHNOLOGY AND -- THE ADVANCES OF TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY,. BEYOND THAT, WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE MARKETPLACE. IT WORKS FAR BETTER/ THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE OBVIOUS ONE. A DECADE AGO, 12 YEARS AGO, NATURAL GAS PRICES WERE DOUBLE-DIGIT. THE END WAS NEAR. WE HAD LESS THAN 10 YEARS OF SUPPLY. YOU MAY REMEMBER YOUR THERE WAS AN AIRPORT FACILITY BEING BUILT FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BRING EXPENSIVE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS TO SUPPLY OUR NATURAL GAS NEED IN THIS COUNTRY. THOSE ARE ABANDONED. THE THREE OR FOUR THAT WERE BUILT OR GONE. A GUY NAME GEORGE MITCHELL AND A PRIVATE COMPANY, THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR, TOOK TWO EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES -- HYDRAULIC FRACKING AND DRILLING, AND CREATED A REVOLUTION. WE'VE GONE FROM 10 YEARS OF SUPPLY TO OVER 100 YEARS OF SUPPLY. THE PRICE HAS GONE FROM DOUBLE DIGITS DOWN TO $2, $3. SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE PRICE FOR OIL. THAT IS AMERICA AT ITS BEST, WHERE PEOPLE PURSUE THEIR DREAMS, SOME OF THEM SUCCEED, SOME OF THEM DON'T, AND IT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF US. THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR HAS CREATED ENORMOUS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS COUNTRY. AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. IT ALSO HAS ANOTHER BENEFIT, WHICH IS NOT ONLY HAS CARBON REDUCTIONS BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE OF THIS, WHICH IT HAS -- MANY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE ARE FLAT LIGHTING IN TERMS OF THEIR PRODUCTION. WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE BECAUSE IT HAS LESS C02 IN MISSIONS. IT HAS ALSO CREATED A OPPORTUNITY FOR US. WE COULD BE ENERGY SECURE WITHIN FIVE YEARS IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT IT. WE WOULD HAVE THE LOWEST COST OF ENERGY. THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS THAT WE COULD REALLY INDUSTRIALIZE THE COUNTRY TO CREATE MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS. IT WOULD ALWAYS ALLOW US TO NOT HAVE A HEAVY FOOTPRINT AROUND THE WORLD. THAT OUR FOREIGN POLICY BE BASED ON OUR VALUES AND NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO USE NATURAL GAS AND OIL AS A TOOL. TO DEAL AS A TOOL TO DEAL WITH THE INSTABILITY IN THE WORLD. I DON'T THINK WE NEED INDUSTRIAL PLANNERS TELLING US WHAT TO DO. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THOUSAND GEORGE MITCHELLS CREATING THE KIND OF INNOVATION THAT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE FORWARD. LIMIT GOVERNMENT'S POWER, AND TO LET THE MARKET PLACE WORK IS PROBABLY THE BEST APPROACH. YES MA'AM? >> TO AMERICA, IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL TO THE DANGER OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM. MY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING IS THAT RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE OF OBAMA, OUR BORDER IS FAR MORE WIDER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. MY QUESTION IS, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, BUT BEYOND THAT, 2 YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO HAVE THAT PORTER OPENED -- THAT BORDER OPEN. WHAT CAN WE DO? >> CONGRESS NEEDS TO PRIORITIZE SPENDING ON THE BORDER. AND PRESCRIBING THROUGH THE BUDGET A STRATEGY TO BE EFFECTIVE ON THAT. SECONDLY, THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE MONEY AND A STRATEGY ON THE PART THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU CONCERN, WHICH IS THAT 40% OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COME WITH A VISA AND THEN DON'T LEAVE. THERE NEEDS TO BE A MUCH BETTER MECHANISM OF WHEN THE VISA EXPIRES TO EITHER HAVE IT THE RENEWED, OR FOR THE PERSON TO LEAVE. THAT NEEDS TO BE THE FIRST PRIORITY. THERE IS NO TRUST, ESPECIALLY WITH THE OBAMA AND HIS STATION, TO DO ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THAT. WHETHER IT IS PUBLIC HEALTH REPRESENTATIVES, NOT AS NATIONAL AS SECURITY THREATS, AND THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THIS HAS TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR SURE. THAN IT YOU CAN GET TO THE BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, WHICH MAKES IT MORE ECONOMICALLY DRIVEN. WE HAVE A SYSTEM TODAY WHERE 80% OF ALL LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, THROUGH FAMILY PETITION. IT IS A NOBLE THING,, DON'T GET ME WRONG. BUT WE HAVE THE BROADEST DEFINITION OF WHAT FAMILY IS. LIKE EVERY COUNTRY, WE HAVE ADULT SIBLINGS AND ADULT PARENTS. WE PUT QUOTAS BY COUNTRY. THAT RESULT IS, WE DON'T HAVE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS STRATEGIC AS IT RELATES TO POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE HAVE A NOBLE INTEGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS LEGAL, THAT IS FINE. BUT I THINK WE SHOULD NARROW IT DOWN TO WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE. WE SHOULD CREATE THE FIRST 500,000 FIRST ROUND DRAFT PICKS, IF YOU WILL. THE PEOPLE THAT WILL CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR LESS. WE WILL NOT GET THERE UNTIL WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE BORDERS ARE ENFORCED AND THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS APPLIED CONSISTENTLY. >> GOVERNOR, I AM A VETERAN AND WORK AT THE VA IN A VENTURE. LAST YEAR, WE HEARD ABOUT VETERANS NOT GETTING PROPER CARE. WHAT IS YOUR MISSION TO ENSURE THAT VETERANS GET BETTER CARE? JEBV BUSH: DO YOU HAVE THE SAME ISSUE IN MANCHESTER? >> WE HAVE NEVER HAD A SECRET WAITLIST OR ANYTHING. I'M NOT SAYING IT IS A PERFECT FACILITY, BUT WE GET POSITIVE REMARKS. >>JEB BUSH: KNOW, IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS PROBLEM. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WHEN YOU HAVE JOHN MCCAIN AND BERNIE SANDERS AGREEING ON A BILL. [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THE FEW LAWS AND BILLS THAT CONNECT RETURN TO A LOT IN THE LAST 4-5 YEARS. IT WAS AN EFFORT TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF REFORMING, I DON'T THINK IT IS THE FULL COMPREHENSIVE REFORM THAT IS NECESSARY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DID, AND YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH US SINCE YOU ARE WORKING AT THE VA HOSPITAL, BUT I THINK IT IS ESSENTIAL GIVEN THE UNIQUENESS OF PEOPLE TO CUSTOMIZE THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE FOR VETERANS. YOU HAVE HEALTH CHALLENGES, LONG-TERM DISABILITY ISSUES, YOU HAVE ISSUES OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WHERE THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM VIETNAM. ALL OF THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD EMPOWER VETERANS TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS. WHERE THEY HAVE THE CHANCE TO PICK THE PLACE AND THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THAT THEY WANT. IN THIS LAW THAT PASSED LAST YEAR, IT ALLOWS FOR -- I HAVE TO CALL IT A DOCTOR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO CALL IT. -- CLALL IT A VOUCHER. I AM ALL INTO THE DOCTOR THING. -- THE VOUCHER THING. SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO MANCHESTER, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL TO MANCHESTER TO GET MEDICAL CARE? YOU ARE GETTING SOMEONE AT THE CHOICE TO GO THEMSELVES. THEY CAN GO TO THE VETERANS HOSPITAL, NO ONE IS SUGGESTING WE SHUT DOWN THE PA SYSTEM. -- DOWN THE VA SYSTEM. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS IS VERY LOW. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE OUTREACH TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO GO TO PRIVATE HOSPITALS IF NECESSARY IF THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR OWN DR.. THIS HAS TO BE A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT, FOR SURE. THERE IS NO ARGUMENT IN TERMS OF BUDGET. THERE HAVE BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASES IN THE BUDGET. IT HAS PROBABLY FLATLINED NOW GIVEN THE SEQUESTER. BUT I TOTALLY AGREE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY. >> FOR THE RECORD, WHOEVER CAN GET THE MOST EFFICIENT AND TIMELY TREATMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY CAN GO. >> ANY IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE COSTS IONN OBAMACARE? JEB BUSH: THE OBVIOUS WAY TO REDUCE UTILIZATION IS TO HAVE PEOPLE BE HEALTHY. THE SYSTEM WE HAVE PRE-OBAMACARE IS NOT A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, IT IS A SICK CARE SYSTEM, IN EFFEC T. ULTIMATELY, I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE TO A PLAN THAT HAS HHAS, HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PREMIUM COVERAGE, WHERE COVERAGE IS ON CATECHOL -- IS ON CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE. SOMETIMES YOU HAVEN'T SERVICES THAT ARE PREVENTED IT, AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T. IF YOU ADDED THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO THIS, WHICH IS KEEPING THE MONEY THAT ROLLS OVER TAX-FREE SO THAT YOU ARE BUILDING UP AN ETHIC TO DEAL WITH HARDER, MORE COSTLY HEALTH CARE NEEDS, YOU ARE GOING TO BEND THE COST CURVE OF THE SYSTEM. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE TORT REFORM. IN FLORIDA, WE FOUGHT HARD FOR THIS. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS OBVIOUSLY A DRIVER, THE UNCERTAINTY OF LAWSUITS CREATE A LOT OF DEFENSIVE MEDICINE THAT WE DON'T NEED. THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. BUT THE INSURANCE PART NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON MOVING BACK TO A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE, LOWER PREMIUM HSA ATTACHED PLAN. I HAVE THIS, THIS IS PREHISTORIC -- THIS IS A PEBBLE. [LAUGHTER] I CAN DO MY STRIDES, MY PULLS, I CAN KNOW HOW LONG I AM SLEEPING, I TAKE IT ON AFTER I WAKE UP. BUT THESE DEVICES -- APPLE JUST ANNOUNCED THEIR DEVICE THIS WEEK -- THESE DEVICES AND MANY OTHERS, MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THIS THING, WILL ALLOW US TO MONITOR OUR OWN HEALTH CARE. WE WILL BE ABLE TO WIRELESSLY SEND MESSAGES TO YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T INGEST A PILL AT THE RIGHT TIME. 40% OF ALL RESEARCH AND DRUGS ARE TAKEN IN THE WRONG WAY. -- OF ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE TAKEN INTO RUNWAY. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE BEST SYSTEM IS WHERE EVERYONE IS ENGAGED IN THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. THAT IS THE AMERICAN WAY. AS WE MOVE AWAY FROM THAT, OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS HAVE GONE UP AND HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN WORSE. TECHNOLOGY GIVES US A CHANCE TO MOVE BACK WHERE WE ARE ENGAGED IN ALL THIS. MAYOR? >> INA SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WITH MY TWO BROTHERS. I POOLED MY EMPLOYEES TO SEE WHAT THEY WANTED ME TO ASK Q. -- TO ASK YOU. >> ONE QUESTION WITH TWO PARTS. >> THE FIRST ONE WILL BE ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU STAND -- ARE YOU ON A FULL REPEAL, OR DO YOU WANT TO TAKE IT WITH PARTS? THE SECOND QUESTION, WHERE DO YOU STAND ON MINIMUM WAGE? JEB BUSH: IS THE QUESTION IS MINIMUM WAGE, I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WAGE THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AS IT RELATES TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAL AND REPLACE. IT MAY END UP IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYEES WOULD WALK, WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE PRETENSES -- HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OF ANY PLAN. IS A SMALL NUMBER, BUT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO STAY ON THEIR PARENTS PLANS UNTIL THEIR 26, I DON'T HAVE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT. I AM NOT PASSIONATE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN HAVE IN A NEW PLAN. THE IDEA THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THESE MASSIVE SUBSIDIES, IS GOING TO BE -- AND EXCHANGES WHERE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF EMPLOYER MANDATED SERVICES THAT INCREASE THE COST OF INSURANCE, IF IT IS GOING TO WORK OVER THE LONG HAUL, I FIND IT FLAWED TO THE CORE. WHAT I DESCRIBE IS A BETTER PLAN IS THE REPLACEMENT PLAN. >> THANK YOU. >> GOVERNOR, I FIND THE MOST TELLING PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES IS OUR INDEBTEDNESS. DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO CONTROL THAT INDEBTEDNESS? JEB BUSH: THE DEBT IS NOT A PROBLEM IN THE HERE AND NOW OF WASHINGTON DC. DON'T TAKE OUT OF CONTEXT. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS A COMMA. BECAUSE WE HAVE LOWERED INTEREST RATES TO ZERO AND WE HAVE INSURED MAJORITY OF THE DOUBLING OF DEBT. UNDER THE PRESIDENT, WE HAVE DOUBLED THE DEBT AND SHRUNK THE MATURITY SO THAT SOMETHING LIKE 60% OF ALL THAT COMES DUE IN 3 YEARS. AS YOU SHRINK THE MATURITIES, THERE IS NO INTEREST. THE DEBT SERVICE TODAY IS LOWER THAN IT WAS 12 YEARS AGO. IS LIKE PASSING THE BOTTLE OF BOURBON AND GETTING THE KEYS TO THE MASERATI TO A 14-YEAR-OLD. [LAUGHTER] IT IS NO REAL EFFORTS TO CHANGE THIS. WHAT HAPPENS IF INTEREST RATES GO UP AFTER HISTORIC LEVELS? YOU HAVE TO RENEW THE DEBT IF YOU CAN, INTEREST RATES WILL GROW EXPONENTIALLY. IT WILL CROWD OUT ALL OF THE THINGS -- NATIONAL SECURITY, VETERANS AFFAIRS, INFRASTRUCTURE. EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE SQUEEZED OUT. FIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD RESTRUCTURE OUR DEBT TO BAKE IT LONG-TERM RATHER THAN SHORT-TERM. SECONDLY, WE OUGHT TO CREATE A HIGH-GROWTH STRATEGY ABOVE ALL ELSE. THE IDEA THAT WE WILL GROW AT 2% PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT DECADE WILL MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR US TO TRULY SERVICE THE DEBT. IF WE GREW AT 4%, WHICH IS HISTORICALLY WHERE AMERICA HAS GROWN, AND THERE ARE DISCRETE, IMPORTANT THINGS TO MAKE THAT WORK. MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR REGULATORY SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. OUR TAX CODE IS CREATING INVESTMENT -- INCENTIVE FOR INVESTMENT OVERSEAS. EMBRACING THE ENERGY REVOLUTION. ALL OF THOSE ENDS WILL HELP US GROW AT 4%. IF YOU WORKOUT THE 2% DIFFERENCE , I WASN'T A BIG MATH GUY, BUT TAKE 1.02 TIMES 18, IN THE 10TH YEAR, WE WOULD CREATE AN ADDITIONAL GERMANY OF ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY. AND ADDITIONAL GERMANY GRADES $1 TRILLION OF REVENUE AT THE STATE, LOCAL, AND FEDERAL LEVEL BASED ON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF TAXATION. THAT IS A FAR BETTER IDEA THAN ANY EXOTIC FORM OF TAXATION BARACK OBAMA WOULD LIKE TO IMPOSE ON US. HIGH GROWTH IS THE FIRST STEP TO DEALING THIS FISCAL, STRUCTURAL PROBLEM. AND IT IS STRUCTURAL. SECONDLY, WE HAVE TO GO TO SOUND BUDGETING PRACTICES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE, BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT, IT PROVIDES THE TREASURY SOMETHING ABOUT $70 BILLION ROCKETS -- $70 BILLION OF PROFITS. THAT IS NOT REVENUE THAT WILL STICK AROUND. THERE WILL BE LOSSES, AND WHEN THOSE LOSSES TAKE PLACE, IT BECOMES PART OF THE DEFICIT. WHETHER IT IS FREDDIE AND FANNIE, THE LOAD PROCESSES, ALL OF THESE THINGS RELATED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND ACCOUNTING PROBLEMS WE HAVE, IT ALL BENEFITS THE GOVERNMENT. LET US BE REAL ABOUT IT. YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE PRESSURE FOR PEOPLE TO SOENDPEND LESS, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO DO. SPENDING LESS WILL BE A HUGE PROBLEM IF WE DON'T FIX OUR ENTITLEMENT PROBLEMS. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT IS -- IT'S NOT -- BUT THE ENTITLEMENT CHALLENGE WILL OVERWHELM EVERYTHING ELSE. THE DEFICITS WE HAVE TODAY WILL PALE BY COMPARISON AT ONE WE GET TO THE BABY BOOMERS ARE BEING RETIRED RECEIVING SOCIAL SECURITY AND RECEIVING MEDICARE. THE EXPANSION OF OUR MEDICAID POPULATION IS EXPLOSIVE FOR OUR DEBT. WE HAVE TO DO WITH THAT ISSUE WHILE CREATING A HIGH-GROWTH STRATEGY. THANK YOU. >> GOVERNOR, OUR FOREIGN POLICY -- WELL, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY. JEB BUSH: WE DO. >>OUR FOREIGN POLICIES ONE OF RETRENCHMENT, DISENGAGEMENT, ONE OF THE THINGS AMERICA'S PRESENCE AND POWERS IN THE WORLD IS NOT A FORCE FOR GOOD. I LOVE READING BOOKS ABOUT HISTORY PARTICULARLY. IF YOU TAKE A PAUSE AT OUR OWN HISTORY, WE HAVE BEEN A FORCE FOR GOOD CONSISTENTLY. SHE IDEA THAT WE ARE NOT IS QUITE DANGEROUS. THE TWO THINGS THAT MATTER IN FOREIGN POLICY IS THAT OUR FRIENDS KNOW THAT WE HAVE THEIR BACK. AND THAT OUR ENEMIES FEAR US A LITTLE BIT -- NOT A LOT, BUT JUST ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE CONSEQUENCE, IF THEY BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT IS DANGEROUS FOR THE REGION OR THE WORLD, THAT WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. OUR CONSISTENT FRIENDS DON'T BELIEVE AMERICA IS RELIABLE. THIS IS A TEST I AM DO THIS ALL THE TIME. YOU'RE GOING TO GO FIRST. [LAUGHTER] NAME A COUNTRY WHERE THE AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP IS BETTER TODAY THAN WHEN BARACK OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE. >> CAN'T DO IT. >> CUBA. JEB BUSH: CONGRATULATIONS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA. MIRROR MARK PERHAPS. BUT NOT CANADA, ABSOLUTELY NOT. NOT LATIN AMERICA. NOT EGYPT. NOT JORDAN, NOT TURKEY, NOT SAUDI ARABIA, NOT THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST, NOT THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES EITHER. THE SIMPLE THING IS THAT THE THIS ENGAGEMENT CREATE SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT -- THE DISENGAGEMENT CREATES SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT THAT PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW WHERE WE STAND. CREATING A PRESENCE IN THE WORLD WOULD BE A POWERFUL FIRST STEP TO BE CREATING MORE SECURITY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO REENGAGE IN A WAY TO DEAL WITH THE THREATS THAT ARE AMONGST US, ISIS BEING ONE OF THOSE. RUSSIA NOW MOVING WITH GREAT AUTHORITY INTO EASTERN EUROPE, AND PERHAPS THE BALTICS. CHALLENGING WHETHER ARTICLE FIVE OF NATO IS A VIABLE TREATY. PEOPLE BEGAN TO HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THAT. THE EMERGENCE OF CHINA AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING THEIR AGENDA IN ASIA. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SERIOUS THREATS. THEN INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN TO LEGITIMIZE THE REGIME, WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE SANCTIONS ON THEM. THEY WOULD HAVE COME TO THE TABLE. $35 A BARREL FOR OIL OVER A YEAR IN IRAN WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE DYNAMIC. INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATING DOWNWARD TO A DEAL THAT WILL CREATE PERMANENCY FOR THE REGIME, WE COULD HAVE CREATED A POLICY THAT WOULD HAVE WEAKENED IRAN IN THEIR SUPPORT OF SURROGATES IN THE REGION AND PROHIBITED THEM FROM GAINING POWER. YES SIR? >> I WOULD LIKE YOUR OPINION ON WHETHER THE HOUSE AND SENATE SHOULD HAVE ONLY FUNDED HOMELAND SECURITY WITHOUT DEALING WITH THE PRESIDENTS, I BELIEVE ILLEGAL ORDER DEALING WITH IMMIGRATION. JEB BUSH: I THINK YOU ARE CORRECT, THE PRESIDENT HAVE AUTHORITY IN EITHER CASE. HE USED THIS CONCEPT OF PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION. WHICH I READ IN TRADITION, BY AND LARGE AS SAYING THAT YOU TAKE THESE CASE-BY-CASE. THERE ARE A LOT OF UNIQUE CASES AND IMMIGRATION. HE USED IT FOR 3 MILLION PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK HE HAS THE AUTHORITY, NOR DOES THE FEDERAL JUDGE. MY GUESS IS THAT THIS WILL ULTIMATELY BE RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL. MY HOPE, TO BE HONEST AND CLEAR, I THINK CONGRESS NEEDS TO PASS A BUDGET. PUT THE PRIORITIES, CONSERVATIVE PRIORITIES ON THE TABLE. GET CONSENSUS AMONG REPUBLICANS FIRST, IF YOU NEED TO DO THAT, GET THE 50 VOTES TO PASS THE BUDGET, USE THE POWER OF THE BUDGET, PASS A BUDGET FOR CRYING ALOUD. THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS IN LANGUAGE AND THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T BE DONE THAT CONTINUE BECAUSE OF THE RESOLUTION APPROACH. THAT BUDGET, THERE ARE WAYS SHOW THE OPPOSITION THE USE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS. I WOULD FULLY FUND THE HOMELAND SECURITY. FURTHER TO YOUR POINTS -- HOW ARE WE GOING TO SECURE THE BORDER? THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT. THERE IS A TIME FOR MAKING A PRINCIPLED OPPOSITION TO THE PRESIDENT. THEN THERE IS A TIME TO GOVERN AND LEAD. REPUBLICANS NEED TO START SHOWING THAT WE CAN'T GOVERN AND LEAD. I'M TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT WE CAN. DEMOCRATS HAVE CONTROL OF THE CONGRESS. AND NO BUDGET PASSED, A STIMULUS PASSED, BEYOND THAT NO BUDGET. IT HAPPENED THROUGH THE SEQUESTER RATHER THAN A NORMAL WAY OF PUTTING PRIORITIES ON THE TABLE. WE NEED TO INCREASE SPENDING ON DEFENSE AND HOMELAND SECURITY AND REDUCE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS. ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW. LET THE PROCESS WORK AGAIN, THAT IS WAS MISSING. EVERY STATE GOVERNMENT, SOMETIMES UGLY, SOMETIMES CLEAN, HAS A BALANCE BUDGET REQUIREMENT. AS CRAZY AS IT IS, AT THE END OF THE DAY, THOSE STATES PASS A BALANCED BUDGET. WASHINGTON IT NEEDS TO DO THE SAME THING. >> I THINK YOU WILL HAVE 20 OF MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE QUESTIONS. I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WILL BE THE CASE. THINK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. WE DID A GREAT JOB. [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE] [CHATTER] JEB BUSH: WHERE ARE WE LOOKING AT? THIS GUY? JEB BUSH: THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO. KEEP TEACHING. JEB BUSH: YOU LOOK JUST LIKE SOMEONE I KNOW IN FORT MEYERS. WE SHOULD TAKE THIS PICTURE AND I'LL SEND IT TO HER. IT IS STRIKING HOW YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HER. THAT IS A GOOD THING, BY THE WAY, JUST FOR THE RECORD. THANK YOU, I'LL SEND THAT TO HER. YOU HAVE HIM TAKING THE PICTURE. >> HELLO GOVERNOR. >> DID YOU GET IT? THANK YOU SO MUCH GOVERNOR. >> DO YOU THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING NOW? JEB BUSH: YES, I THINK IT JUST TAKES TIME. >> PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM, BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND COMMON CORE. JEB BUSH: I THINK IT SHOULD BE A COMBINATION OF BOTH. BUT WITH COMMON CORE -- >> YOU'RE BREAKING IT DOWN AND GIVING PEOPLE A DIFFERENT WAY TO LOOK AT. JEB BUSH: REAUTHORIZATION OF THE K01-12 WOULD TAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE OFF THE TABLE, WHICH I THINK WOULD BE GOOD. WHAT DID YOU THINK? >> WE LOVED IT. JEB BUSH: THIS IS HOW YOU GET YOUR NOURISHMENT. I GET A LOT OF ENERGY LEARNING FROM PEOPLE. >> JEB BUSH HOSTED THIS EVENING AT THE HOME OF THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE GOP. SENATOR TED CRUZ WHEN NOT BE WELCOME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE HE "" REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND NOT INTERESTED IN APPEALING TO ALL AMERICANS, ONLY THE FRENCH, -- THEO THE FRINGE.""

I WILL GRADUATE IN MAY, THEN I WILL HEAD TO AN APPLE IS THE NAVAL ACADEMY TO MAJOR IN ENGINEERING. HILLARY CLINTON: GOOD LUCK. >> I AM A JUNIOR. STARTED TAKING CLASSES MY SOPHOMORE YEAR AT KIRKWOOD, AN ONLINE CLASS. I AM CURRENTLY IN ARTS AND SCIENCES. AND BY THE TIME I GRADUATE, I WILL HAVE 48 CREDIT HOURS DONE. HILLARY CLINTON: WOW, THAT IS GREAT. OK. DIANE: MY NAME IS DIANE AND I HAVE SPENT THE LAST 21 YEARS AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. SIX OF THOSE YEARS PART-TIME AS AN ADJUNCT INSTRUCTOR. HILLARY CLINTON: GREAT. >> I HAVE BEEN A TEACHER. WELCOME TO MONTICELLO. HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. [INDISCERNIBLE] [LAUGHTER] DREW: I AM DREW AND I AM CURRENTLY TAKING BIOTECH CLASSES HERE. I HAVE HAD A GREAT TIME IN THIS COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. I PLAN TO GO ON TO DO SOMETHING WITH ENGINEERING. HILLARY CLINTON: GREAT, GOOD. >> I AM A NONTRADITIONAL COLLEGE STUDENT. I AM TAKING ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT AND I AM ALSO DOING OTHER PROGRAMS AT KIRKWOOD. HILLARY CLINTON: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. AT THE COLLEGE AND I JUST HAD A TERRIFIC FOR OF -- TOUR OF THE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING LABORATORY, AND TALKED WITH THE INSTRUCTOR, THE STUDENTS, ALL FORMER HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ARE DOING WORK LIKE WHAT YOU DESCRIBED, THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MIX YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARS WITH COLLEGE LEARNING AND COLLEGE CREDITS. THAT IS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. AND I AM REALLY PLEASED TO BE AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT IS SO VISIONARY AND EFFECTIVE IN TRYING TO SERVE AS A BRIDGE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NONTRADITIONAL, BUT COMING BACK TO ADD TO THEIR SKILLS, ALL THE WAY TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COLLEGE AND THE HIGH SCHOOL. IT IS SOMETHING I WANT TO SEE MORE OF. THIS IS A REAL MODEL FOR HOW WE CAN PROVIDE MORE CONTINUOUS LEARNING, STARTING IN HIGH SCHOOL, BUT GOING AS FAR AS NECESSARY. -- TO HELP PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE, AND ALL PEOPLE, FOR THE ECONOMY THAT IS RAISING US. FOR WE GET STARTED, I WANT TO HEAR FROM EACH OF YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE AS THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE IN YOUR EDUCATION, BUT THE STUDENTS AND AS EDUCATORS. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU HOPE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY I AM HERE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT AMERICANS HAVE COME BACK FROM SOME TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. AND OUR COUNTRY IS MUCH BETTER OFF, BECAUSE AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE BASICALLY DONE WHATEVER IT TOOK TO MAKE IT WORK. BUT I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE DECK IS STILL STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE ALREADY AT THE TOP. AND THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH -- WHEN CEOS MAKE 300 TIMES MORE THAN A TYPICAL WORKER. WHAT AMERICAN WORKERS KEEP GETTING MORE PRODUCTIVE, AS I JUST SAW, AND IT IS A VERY POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF EDUCATION AND SKILLED TRAINING, BUT THAT PRODUCTIVITY IS NOT MATCHED IN OTHER PAYCHECKS. AND THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HEDGE FUND MANAGERS PAY LOWER TAX RATES THAN NURSES OR THE TRUCKERS AND THAT I SAW ON I-80 AS IT WAS DRIVING HERE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. AND THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THOUGH DEEPLY INTO DEBT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE EDUCATION AND SKILLS THEY NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BEST OF THEIR OWN LIVES. AND I LOOK AT THE FIGURES, THE AVERAGE IOWA GRADUATE FROM A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE COMES OUT WITH NEARLY $30,000 IN DEBT. AND THAT IS THE NINTH HIGHEST DEBT LOAD IN THE COUNTRY. AND PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING ON THAT. I MET EARLIER TODAY WITH A YOUNG STUDENT WHO IS PIECING TOGETHER WORK, LOANS, KNOWING FULL WELL THAT HE IS GOING TO COME OUT OWING A LOT OF MONEY. SO, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IN THIS COUNTRY HOW TO GET BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT AMERICA AND ITS FAMILIES NEED A CHAMPION. I WANT TO BE THAT CHAMPION. I WANT TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CANNOT JUST GET I COME IN BUT GET AHEAD AND THEY CAN STAY AHEAD. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE ASKED ME, WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS AND WHAT MOTIVATES YOU I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF MY MOTHER'S EXAMPLE. SHE HAD A DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD, WAS MISTREATED, NEGLECTED, BUT SHE NEVER GAVE UP. SHE WAS BASICALLY ON HER OWN FROM THE AGE OF 14 AND SHE KEPT GOING. AND MY FATHER, WHO WAS A SMALL BUSINESS MAN AND BELIEVED YOU HAD TO WORK HARD TO MAKE YOUR WAY INTO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE SUCCESSFUL, AND PROVIDED A GOOD LIVING FOR OUR FAMILY. THEN I WAS THINKING TO ABOUT THE LESSONS I LEARNED FROM MY CHURCH. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE BACK. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP OTHERS. AND THAT IS WHAT I TRY TO DO. WE WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WE GO FORWARD, WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AND -- I WORKED FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, WE WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR, THIS IS BACK IN THE 1970'S, WHEN KIDS WITH DISABILITIES WERE BASICALLY SHUT OUT OF SCHOOLS AND THANKS TO YOUR GREAT FORMER SENATOR, THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE. BUT I WAS KNOCKING ON DOORS SAYING, IS THERE ANYBODY SCHOOL AGE NOT IN SCHOOL? AND FINDING BLIND KIDS, DEAF KIDS, KIDS IN WHEELCHAIRS AND I WAS ABLE TO WORK TO TRY TO IMPROVE EDUCATION THERE AND GET MORE KIDS CHANCES WHO REALLY DESERVED THEM. AND AS FIRST LADY, FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM, UNTIL WE GOT HEALTH CARE INSURANCE FOR KIDS. AND AS SENATOR, DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE NEW YORK AFTER 9/11 AND TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE GET WHATEVER THEY NEEDED, THE VICTIMS'FAMILIES AND FIRST RESPONDERS. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE HONOR TO DO THAT. AND AS SECRETARY OF STATE, STANDING UP FOR OUR COUNTRY. WHEN I LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, I AM SO ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THERE ISN'T ANYBODY ANYWHERE THAT CAN OUTCOMPETE US, WHO HAS THAT ARE VALUES, HE COULD DO MORE TO PROVIDE MORE PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR OWN GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. WE CANNOT TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. SO, I WANT TO BE THE CHAMPION WHO GOES TO BAT FOR AMERICANS IN FOR BIG AREAS -- 4 BIG FIGHT, BIG AREAS, AND THOSE WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH ME, WE NEED TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY OF TOMORROW, NOT YESTERDAY. WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES, THAT IS WHERE IT STARTS. WE NEED TO FIX DYSFUNCTIONAL POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND IT UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF IT, EVEN IF IT TAKES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. AND WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY FROM THREATS THAT WE SEE AND THE ONES ON THE HORIZON. SO, I AM HERE TO BEGIN A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT. AND TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND, WITH THE CHALLENGES YOU SEE ARE AND I WILL WORK HARD TO MEET AS MANY PEOPLE, I WILL BE ROLLING OUT IDEAS AND POLICIES ABOUT WHAT I THINK WILL WORK, BUT I WANT IT TO BE INFORMED BY WHAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING. AND I WANT TO BUILD ON WHAT HAS WORKED, GOING FORWARD. AND TO STAND UP AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE A DIFFERENT VISION OF OUR COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT ONE MAN I GREW UP WITH AND A DIFFERENT ONE THAN I THINK WHAT IS BEST FOR EVERYBODY. WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO IS ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND HEAR FROM FOLKS ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AND TRY TO LEARN WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE WAYS OF HELPING YOUR YOUNG PEOPLE GET THE KIND OF EDUCATION THEY NEED, WITHOUT HAVING THE PERSONAL BANK BE BROKEN AND PUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT FINANCIAL RISK. IF I COULD START WITH YOU, YOU ARE GOING TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY? THAT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE FEW HIGHER EDUCATION OF SUCH HIGH QUALITY THAT IS FREE. THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN RECRUITED INTO OUR MILITARY ACADEMIES ARE GIVEN JUST A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION. CAN YOU MAYBE DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU LEARNED IN THE BIOTECH CLASSES YOU TOOK AND HOW YOU THINK THAT HAS HELPED YOU WITH TAKING THIS NEXT STEP? >> WE HAD ALL THE COMPUTERS IN THE LAB, THEY SAID HE WILL FIND THIS HERE, TAKE EVERYTHING OF THE COMPUTER AND FOR BACK. IT WAS VERY HANDS-ON, IT WASN'T SITTING BEHIND A COMPUTER, LEARNING HOW TO GO THROUGH THIS AND THAT. READING FROM A LAB LOOK, TAKING NOTES, IT WAS PHYSICALLY DOING WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN THE INFOTECH FIELD. WE DO A LOT WITH THE TECH FIELD BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF THE KIDS GOING INTO THE ACADEMY LOOK FOR, SOMETHING WITH I.T., SOFTWARE DESIGN. IT IS SOMETHING I WOULD DO, IF I GOT A CAREER IN THAT FIELD. AND WITH BIOTECH, I WILL PROBABLY NOT DO TOO MUCH WITH BIOLOGY, BUT I TOOK A BECAUSE OF THE ENGINEERING BACKGROUND AND -- ANYTIME WE DO EXPERIMENTS, WE WRITE DOWN THESE REACTIONS, YOU TAKE NOTES ON EVERYTHING THAT CHANGES, ANY SHAPE OR FORM, AND THEN IT PREPARES ME FOR THE KIND OF ENGINEERING WORK, LIKE BEING IN A LAB SITUATION. IT IS THE KIND OF THING I WILL SEE. AND WHILE THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND PUBLIC, THERE IS NO DROP-OFF IN QUALITY. I AM GETTING THE KIND OF SKILLS I WOULD GET IN WILL GET AT THE ACADEMY. HILLARY CLINTON: YOU SOUND LIKE YOU WILL BE WELL PREPARED FOR A RIGOROUS CURRICULUM THAT WILL DEMAND A LOT OF YOU. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE EITHER FORMER OR CURRENT MIDSHIPMAN AND I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING THE STUDY IS. YOU FEEL LIKE THIS HAS GIVEN YOU THE HANDS ON EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN TRANSFER. JASON, EXPLAIN THE IDEA ABOUT HOW THE HIGH SCHOOLS COORDINATE WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES, BECAUSE PART OF THE REASON I AM HERE IS BECAUSE THIS IS A ROLE MODEL, THIS IS NOT BY ACCIDENT THAT I ENDED UP AT KIRKWOOD, BECAUSE WE LOOKED FOR THOSE MODELS. LIFELONG LEARNING, CONNECTING US, THE HIGH SCHOOL WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES, OTHER PROGRAMS, GIVE ME A SENSE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THAT? >> WELL, IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS. THE PARTNERSHIP, THE WAY IT WORKS, KIRKLAND AND THEIR APPROACH, THEY ARE PART OF A GROUP, THERE ARE EIGHT SCHOOLS. OUR PARTICULAR SCHOOL IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST, MAYBE 45 KIDS IN THE GRADUATING CLASS. THE BIGGEST ONES, MAYBE MONTICELLO, THEY HAVE A HUNDRED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, WE EACH LOOK AT EACH OTHER LIKE, HAD WE HAVE A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR MANUFACTURING LAB IN OUR SCHOOL, YOU CAN DO IT. WHERE DO WE SEND THEM. WE CAN'T PUT THEM IN A CAR AND DRIVE THERE. WHAT THEY DID IS THEY STARTED HAVING A CONVERSATION, AT THE END OF THE DATE, THE KIRKWOOD PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE SCHOOLS, WE COMMIT TO SENDING -- AND WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY, WE SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT KIDS, AND WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION, I WOULD LOVE TO OFFER AS MANY THINGS IN OUR SCHOOL AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. I DON'T HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES TO ADD 15 NEW TEACHERS AND 15 NEW PROGRAMS. COLLECTIVELY THOUGH, WE CAN. THIS IS A PERFECT MODEL. OUR KIDS, AT THE OF THE DAY THE REASON IS, BECAUSE IT GIVES OUR KIDS MORE OPTIONS AND IT IS STUFF -- YOU HAVE A FOUR-YEAR CAREER, DOES RIGOROUS COURSE WORKS THAT CAN GET THEM READY, AND A SEGUE FOR COLLEGE, YOU ARE IN COLLEGE, YOU ARE NOT. HE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH PARENTS, I WENT TO THIS AND I FEEL PREPARED AND READY. THROW THEM OUT THERE. AND THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS, WE HAVE AUDIO TECH, MANUFACTURING, THEY ARE DIRECTED TOWARD A CAREER. AND CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE, THE GETTY FOCUS OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND WE HELP THEM GET IT. NOW THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT. >> AND CONFIDENCE. >> AND WE HELD IN STILL THAT. -- HELP INSTILL THAT. THEY FEEL CONFIDENT AND THEY ARE CERTIFIED, NOW I WANT TO GO ON AND BE A NURSE, NOW I WANT TO DO THIS IN THE FACTORY, AND THEY KNOW I AM GOOD, I CAN GET A JOB. IT IS GREAT. HILLARY CLINTON: SO IF YOU ARE ENROLLED IN A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL, IT IS FREE? >> RIGHT, AND WE ARE SUPPORTED, IT IS POSTED IN VERY -- POST SECONDARY. IT IS GREAT TO SEE THESE KIDS GET THESE JOBS, WHEN THEY ARE HERE THEY ARE HELPING EACH OTHER AND THEY BRING EACH OTHER TO ANOTHER LEVEL. THEY ARE READY TO EXCEL AND TO KEEP GOING. I LOVE THAT THESE KIDS ARE AROUND THAT. AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, -- AND COLLECTIVELY WE WILL HAVE ALL KIDS LIKE THAT. THE KIDS GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER, THEY LEARN FROM EACH OTHER, NOT JUST IN THEIR EDUCATION, BUT THEY KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE IN COLLEGE. THEY MEET KIDS FROM OTHER YOU SEE SOMEONE. YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS IN COLLEGE AND YOU MEET KIDS ARE MOTHER SCHOOLS? HILLARY CLINTON: WE CALLED COLLECT IN THOSE DAYS. JASON: WE'RE STILL THERE, COUNSELORS AND PRINCIPLES ARE THERE. I AM OFF TO COLLEGE AND I HAD A ROUGH START. I DID NOT HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM SO IT IS A NICE SEGUE FOR OUR KIDS. THEY LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THEIR TIMES. THEY GET A CAREER OUT OF THIS. THEY GO OFF AND GET A JOB. I'M A HUGE FAN OF WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO INCREASE THAT RIGOR, WITHOUT HAVING TO HIRE 10 NEW TEACHERS. THIS IS A GREAT MODEL. HILLARY CLINTON: I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. TRUE, TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOU ARE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU STILL HAVE ANOTHER YEAR. HOW DID YOU END UP HERE, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT IT, DID A COUNSELOR TELL YOU ABOUT IT? >> WE HAD MEETINGS, THEY COME BACK AND SHARE ABOUT IT. KIRKWOOD SEEMED FUN, SO MANY DIFFERENT CLASSES, YOU GET THE COLLEGE FEEL. IT IS DIFFERENT FROM OWING TO HIGH SCHOOL. BEING ABLE TO COME HERE AND PARTICIPATE IN ALL THIS STUFF, I AM IN OF THE AUDIO TECH ACADEMY. SO, WE GET TO DO EVERYTHING HANDS ON. THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS, WE ARE OUT WORKING ON CARS. WE ARE EXPERIENCING EVERYTHING. IT IS GREAT TO GET OUT AND DO STUFF AND NOT JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT FOR WEEKS ON END AND THEN MAYBE GO GOOD TO DO SOME OF THE STUFF. SO, IT IS GREAT. HILLARY CLINTON: IS IT YOUR EXPERIENCE WORKING ON AUTO, YOU HAVE TO LEARN A LOT OF MATH, COMPUTERS, THEY WERE TALKING TO ME ABOUT WITH THE COMPUTERIZED NUMERIC CONTROL, TRYING TO REALLY USE THEIR MATH SKILLS AND UPGRADE THEM SO THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH ALL OF THE COMPUTERIZATION? >> YES, CARS ARE CONTROLLED WITH COMPUTERS NOW, WE DO A TON OF WORK WITH COMPUTERS. THAT IS VALUABLE TO KNOW. IN ORDER TO BE CERTIFIED, GOING ON INTO THE MOTOR FIELD -- >> THAT IS THE INSTRUCTOR RIGHT THERE. >> -- HILLARY CLINTON: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING HERE? >> SIX YEARS. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS GREAT. I LIKE THIS MODEL, BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE IN HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY CAN GET HANDS ON AND FEEL LIKE THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING THEY LOVE, THAT MOTIVATES THEM TO LEARN THE MATH, TO LEARN THE COMPOSITION, LEARN THE SKILLS THAT WILL HELP THEM. WHAT I HAVE SEEN HAPPEN IN OTHER PLACES. >> THIS IS FOR EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT, THIS WAS STARTED SIX YEARS AGO. WE HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH THIS, THE PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE FORMED WITH THE STEEL PEOPLE, THIS -- ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA, BUT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTY SERVICE AREA. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL THAT WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT FOR A BOND ISSUE AND ASKED FOR THE AREA TO APPROVE DOLLARS TO BUILD MORE OF THESE. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE, THE SECOND ONE IS IN CEDAR RAPIDS, THE THIRD IN WASHINGTON, IOWA. AND THE FOURTH ONE WILL BE THE FIRST IN THE NATION WHERE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TOLD ON A FOUR-YEAR CAMPUS. THIS IS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. LAST YEAR, THIS YEAR, WE WILL SERVE OVER 500,000 HIGH SCHOOLERS. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE HIGH SCHOOLERS. SOME OF THEM ARE FIRST GENERATION. THEY GET A CHANCE, JUST LIKE THESE FOLKS, TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN HIGH SCHOOL. MAYBE AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE -- BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT, AND OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM. NOT ONLY FOR OUR COLLEGE AGE STUDENTS, BUT ALSO FOR K-12 PARTNERS AND THEY HAVE WIDELY SUPPORTED US. NOT ONLY DO THEY COME TO OUR CENTERS, BUT WE ALSO SEND OUR FACULTY INTO HIGH SCHOOLS. SO THEY GET WHAT IS CALLED DUAL CREDIT, LAST YEAR ALONE, IF YOU TALK ABOUT, IF YOU COME TO KIRKLAND -- KIRKWOOD, THOSE PARENTS WILL SAY $2.5 MILLION IN TUITION. IF THEY COME TO KIRKWOOD. IF THEY WENT TO IOWA, THE TUITION IS ABOUT TWICE AS HIGH, TRIPLE IF YOU GO PRIVATE. SO, LIKE SHE HAS, THAT WILL LOWER THE STUDENT DEBT. IT REALLY GIVES THEM THE EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE BEST PICTURES WE HAVE FOR HERE, ALL OF THE STUDENTS, THEY ALL COME JUST IN A FOOTBALL UNIFORMS AND VOLLEYBALL UNIFORMS AND GOLF AND CHEERLEADING AND EVERYTHING, WE TAKE A PICTURE. SO THAT NIGHT, THEY GO COMPETE ON THE FIELD, BUT HERE THEY LEARN TOGETHER. IT IS A PARTNERSHIP. AND I THINK THEY REALLY HAVE GROWN AND HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT. ANOTHER THING THAT WE REALLY THINK SETS US APART, A LOT OF OUR CTE COURSES ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED. WHEN THEY LEAVE HERE THEY WILL HAVE A CERTIFICATE. I JUST TALKED TO A YOUNG MAN IN WASHINGTON, HE IS A SENIOR, HE WILL GRADUATE WITH US. HE WILL HAVE A CERTIFICATE IN WELDING. HE HAS HAD FIVE JOB OFFERS AND HE WILL GO OUT AND MAKE $40,000 HIS FIRST YEAR, OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. THIS LAND WAS DONATED BY BUSINESS PERSON. HILLARY CLINTON: YOU PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND PEOPLE. PARENTS, BUSINESS, THEY CAN SEE THE RESULTS. WE HAVE GOT TO REBUILD THAT CONNECTION BECAUSE IN TOO MANY PLACES, THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS. AND BEING CREATIVE AS YOU HAVE BEEN ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES. I DID WANT TO ASK YOU, WHEN DID YOU START TAKING COURSES HERE? ELLEN: I STARTED MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I TOOK AN ONLINE COURSE. AND THEN I ACTUALLY STARTED TAKING THE KIRKWOOD ACADEMY. ARTS AND SCIENCES I. I ACTUALLY DO NOT TAKE A MAIN COURSE. I TAKE IT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. I GET CREDITS, HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CREDIT AND COLLEGE CREDIT, TOO. HILLARY CLINTON: SO YOU WILL HAVE 48 COLLEGE CREDITS WHEN YOU GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL? ELLEN: YEP. BECAUSE I AM ALSO TAKING AN ONLINE CLASS RIGHT NOW. I'LL TAKE A COURSE OUT HERE IN THE SUMMER AND I TOOK ONE LAST SUMMER. HILLARY CLINTON: ARE THERE MANY OTHER STUDENTS DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING AMONG YOUR FRIENDS? ELLEN: YEAH, THERE ARE A LOT OF MY CLASSMATES IN THE KIRKWOOD ACADEMY WITH ME BUT THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL DO SUMMER COURSES ON TOP OF THAT AND ALSO ONLINE CLASSES BECAUSE -- THIS YEAR, NOW AT OUR SCHOOL, WE STARTED WHEN CAN TAKE KIRKWOOD AND -- THE ONLINE KIRKWOOD CLASS. SO I CAN GET A LOT MORE CREDITS. HILLARY CLINTON: AND YOU'RE STILL DOING HER HIGH SCHOOL COURSES OR ID SUBSTITUTE FOR YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COURSES? ELLEN: THE ENGLISH CREDIT IS DIFFERENT. IT IS THE COMPOSITION I AND II CLASS. YOU GET COLLEGE CREDIT IN HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CLASSES. USUALLY IF YOU WOULD TAKE A KIRKWOOD CLASS, YOU WOULD GET AN ELECTIVE CREDIT. SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE YOUR ENGLISH CLASSES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. IT HELPS A LOT. HILLARY CLINTON: WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU WITH ALL THESE CREDITS? ELLEN: WELL, I PLAN ON GOING TO MT. MARCY. AND I THINK I'M GOING TO MAJOR IN BUSINESS BUT I WILL HAVE TWO YEARS DONE. I WILL ALMOST HAVE AN ASSOCIATES DEGREE. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS TERRIFIC. SO THEN, YOU WILL ONLY HAVE TO PAY FOR TWO YEARS OF FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. ELLEN: KIRKWOOD AND MONTICELLO HIGH SCHOOL, THE PARTNERSHIP HAS PROVIDED ME WITH A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES. I'M FORTUNATE TO BE A PART OF THAT. HILLARY CLINTON: YOU ARE WALKING ADVERTISEMENT FOR IT, FOR HOW IMPORTANT THIS OPTION IS. DIANE, AS AN INSTRUCTOR HOW YOU SEE THE BENEFIT OF THESE BLENDED PROGRAMS AND WHAT ISSUES HAVE YOU SEEN A RISE? HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A BETTER. DIANE: A GREAT QUESTION. JASON MENTIONED MANY OF THE POSITIVES THAT COME OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. I THINK THE BEST THING I SEE IS, ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE PREMISE OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, I DO FEEL AS FIF BY FOCUSING SO MUCH ON MAKING SURE EVERYONE IS PROFICIENTLY SOMETIMES DO NOT STRETCH THE HIGHER ACHIEVERS. THAT IS WHERE KIRKWOOD HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. IT HAS OFFERED PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS LIKE ELLEN WHO EXCEL IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO NEEDED EXTRA CHALLENGE. AND SOME TIMES, NOT JUST A CHALLENGE IN ENGLISH OR IN SPEECH BUT IN THE CTE AREAS. SO I THINK THAT HAS BEEN A GAP THAT THIS PROGRAM IS HELD FILL. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN EDUCATION REFORM FOR A LONG TIME, NOT IN RECENT YEARS IN AN ACTIVE WAY, BUT CERTAINLY IS A VERY INTERESTED OBSERVER. AND I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO OPEN UP OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO THAT WE ARE MEETING INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS WHERE THERE ARE AND WHERE THEY COULD BE WITH THE RIGHT MOTIVATION, THE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING, THE HANDS-ON, FOR EXAMPLE. AND I THINK WE DO HAVE TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES, BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE INDIVIDUALIZED LEARNING THAT NEEDS TO GO ON. SO, HOW WE DO THAT IN THIS GIGANTIC COUNTRY OF OURS, YOU CAN SEE HOW IT CAN WORK THROUGH A SCHOOL BY SCHOOL BASIS OF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN MONTICELLO AND KIRKWOOD AND I'M LOOKING FOR THOSE GOOD IDEAS. SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO GO FURTHER AND PROVIDE THEM TO MORE PEOPLE WITH PERHAPS NOT THE EXPOSURES THAT YOUR STUDENTS HAVE HAD. SO, YOU HAVE TAUGHT HOW MANY YEARS? DIANE: 21. HILLARY CLINTON: 21. PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL? DIANE: CORRECT. HILLARY CLINTON: HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE YOUR STUDENTS TODAY FROM THE STUDENTS YOU TAUGHT WHEN HE FIRST STARTED? DIANE: OH, ANOTHER VERY GOOD QUESTION. I THINK OUR STUDENTS ARE BOLDER TODAY. I THINK THEY ARE MORE WILLING TO TAKE RISK. I THINK THEY ARE ALSO MORE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE FUTURE. 20 YEARS AGO, A SET NUMBER OF STUDENTS BELIEVED, I'M GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE. AND ANOTHER SET SAID, I AM VERY CONTENT GETTING A JOB AND WORKING IN THE FAMILY FARM. SO THAT IS WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO DO. AND WE'VE SEEN A SHIFT IN EDUCATION WHERE THERE IS A LOT MORE PRESSURE TO GO ON AND PURSUE AN EDUCATION. AND A LOT OF THAT HAS COME FROM THE REPORTS OF FINANCIAL GAIN. WE SEE ALL THESE CHARTS ABOUT, WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE. WITH A TWO YEAR OR FOR YOUR DEGREE, THIS IS HOW YOUR OUTLOOK AND CHANGE. I THINK STUDENTS SEE THAT. IF I WANT TO LIVE THIS AMERICAN JIM, I HAVE GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE. 00--- TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. I THINK IT IS A POSITIVE PRESSURE THAT THEY WANT TO CHALLENGE THEMSELVES TO DO MORE. I THINK THEY ARE ALSO BECOMING VERY AWARE THAT THESE JOBS WHERE ONCE THEY ARE ABLE 20 YEAR SS AGO, THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL AND GET, NOW THEY DO NOT HAVE ALL THE TRAINING THEY NEED. I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER GAP KIRKWOOD HELPS FILL, SOME OF THAT TRAINING SO THEY CAN LEAVE -- JASON: I WOULD PIGGYBACK ON WHAT DIANE SAID. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 16 YEARS. WHAT A SCENE AS YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT EXCEPT ONE THING THAT IS DIFFERENT IS YOU HAVE TO -- KIDS HAVE TO BE MORE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THEIR CHOICES ARE. IF YOU GO BACK 20 YEARS AGO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT JOBS WERE PLENTIFUL. THE ECONOMY WAS GREAT. HILLARY CLINTON: I REMEMBER. JASON: THERE WAS SOMEONE HE WAS HELPING LEAD US THROUGH THAT. AND WHAT I'D SAY IT WAS KIND OF EASY TO GET A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE DEBT. THAT IS WHAT I SPENT A CONSIDERABLE OBAMA -- CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO SAVE THEM ONMONEY. SO SHE CAN MAKE A DECISION TO GET 48 CREDITS FOR THE RIGHT REASON. NOW ELLEN, MAN, I'VE GOT TO GET THIS CREDIT BECAUSE THIS GIVES ME TO MT. MERCY. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING? WE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION AND APRON I PRAY THAT THEY USED TO HAVE WHEN YOU ARE SENIOR. THE PRESSURE IS YOU HAVE TO BE PRECISE. THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE ROOMS LIKE THIS GET THEM NATIONALLY CERTIFIED. THEN YOU HAV E TO DO A JOB OF GETTING KIDS TO THAT PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS ANOTHER THING KIRKWOOD DOES, WHICH I WANTED TO ASK MITCH TO EXPLAIN. AS I UNDERSTAND, YOU DO A LOT OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR THE STUDENTS HERE. A LOT OF OUTREACH TO HELP THEM. YOU STARTED IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL NOT GOING TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND THE END OF AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THEN THEY ME CONTINUING HELP. MITCH: AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE VALUE OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE, THERE ARE A COUPLE THAT COME TO MIND. ONE IS WE ARE AT LOWER COST SO A STUDENT WHO DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP, THEY CAN START. THAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF OUR CENTERS. THEY CANE COME IN AS A SOPHOMORE OR JUNIOR AND THEY CAN THINK ABOUT-- FIND OUT THEY DO NOT LIKE -- I'M GOING TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE. PROBABLY THE BEST THING THIS DOES IS, AS YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DELIVERING, AND IT IS REALLY, WE'RE FOCUSED IN ON THOSE LITTLE SKILL JOBS WHICH ARE PLENTIFUL OUT THERE WERE PEOPLE, WHERE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO TAKE THOSE JOBS. SO A LOT OF OUR ACADEMIES FOCUSING ON THOSE. WE HAVE OVER 20 ACADEMIES. YOU CAN DO PRE-DENTAL, PRE-ENGINEERING, YOU NAME IT WE HAVE GOT IT. THERE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS CHOOSE FROM. THAT'S THE VALUE OF HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM AS YOU LOOK AT IT. IT IS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE WITH THE K-12. EVERY ONE OF TEHHEM IS INVOLVED IN OUR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT WHICH GIVES AN ADVANTAGE THERE. BUT I JUST, WE, WELL, WE DO ONE THING IN EIGHTH GRADE. WE BRING IN EVERY A GREATER INTO A FINANCIAL LITERACY DAY THROUGH OUR WORKPLACE LEARNING CONNECTION. AND SO, THAT'S -- I WON'T GO INTO WHAT THAT IS. THEY COME IN FOR A DAY, AND THEY HAVE, THEY WANT TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP AND EVERYBODY HAS TO DO THAT AT THE END OF EIGHTH GRADE. YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN. I HAVE A PLAN, IS WHAT IT IS CALLED. HILLARY CLINTON: ABOUT BEING PRECISE. THIS IS WHAT YOU SAY WANT TO DO AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. THAT'S SO IMPORTANT. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO ARE JUST AS CONFUSED AND APPREHENSIVE AS THEIR KIDS ARE. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AND HOW DO YOU DO IT? HOW DO I EVEN TALK TO MY KID ABOUT IT? THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE ARE HELPING TO SUPPORT THE CONVERSATION GOING ON INSIDE THE FAMILY'S. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR COMING TO SCHOOL AND WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE? ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. >> WORKED IN HOMELAND SECURITY. I DECIDED ON A CAREER CHANGE. SO I DECIDED TO COME TO KIRKWOOD. I'M SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE KIDS. THERE IS NO WAY COULD AFFORD ANYTHING OTHER THAN KIRKWOOD. I WAS ALLOWED TO WORK THE WORK-STUDY PROGRAM, AND I WAS GRANTED APELL GRANTS, WHICH HAVE HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY THROUGH THIS. BEING A PARENT OFA THAT IS GETTING READY TO COME TO KIRKWOOD NEXT YEAR, I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH BEING HERE TO HELP HER GET THROUGH THE REST OF IT BECAUSE COLLEGE HAS BECOME MORE OF A A NECESSITY THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE, I THINK. IN ORDER, WHICH IS WHY I CAME BACK TO KIRKWOOD, BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE PROFICIENT IN A SKILL THAT I COULD USE INA A VARIETY OF WAYS WHIC THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES THAT. HILLARY CLINTON: DOES THE WORK PROGRAM, PELL GRANT PAY FOR IT OR DO YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL COST? >> SO FAR. I AM GETTING TO A POINT WHERE I MAY HAVE TO TAKE OUT LOANS, WHICH I'M TRYING TO AVOID BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT A LARGE DEBT WHEN I'M DONE. WHEN I'M DONE WITH KIRKWOOD, I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE ON TO A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. HILLARY CLINTON: IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, THAT IS A GREAT GOAL. I FULLY SUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE, BUT EVEN IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING THE COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GOING TO COLLEGE FREE, THERE ALL THESE OTHER COSTS PEOPLE HAVE TO FIGURE HOW TO WAY TO PAY. AND SO, WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ACTUAL STUDENT AND THE STUDENTS FAMILY. WHAT CAN YOU AFFORD? WHAT AMOUNT OF DEBT AREE YOU WILLING TO TAKE ON? HOW THREE MAKE SURE IT IS AFFORDABLE AND IT CAN BE PAID BACK A STUN YOUR INCOME SO THAT YOU DO NOT GET PUSHED INTO AN ABSOLUTELY UNTENABLE FINANCIAL SITUATION RIGHT OUT OF SCHOOL? BUT THEN THEY ARE ALL THESE OTHER COSTS. WHETHER IT IS BOOKS OR ONLINE MATERIALS. WHATEVER YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY GO TO THE COURSES. AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME THAT THAT BECOMES A BIGGER PROBLEM. THAT, LIKE A PELL GRANT COVERS MOST OF NOT ALL OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COST. BUT A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE WORKING OR THEY ARE SINGLE PARENTS AND THEY HAVE ALL THESE OTHER EXPENSES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY HELP TRYING TO PAY. HOW DO YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? >> THAT IS WHERE THE WORK STUDY HAS COME IN, BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY WHILE I'M GOING TO SCHOOL. NOT ENOUGH TO RAISE MY FAMILY ON. BUT EVENTUALLY, IT WILL BE. I'LL GET THERE. HILLARY CLINTON: I THINK THAT LOOKING AT EDUCATION, IT TRULY DOES REMAIN NOT ONLY THE BEST PATHWAY -- ALTHOUGH NOT EVERYBODY HAS TO DO IT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. GETTING THESE NATIONAL CERTIFICATIONS THAT ENABLE YOU TO MAKE $40,000 BECAUSE YOU ARE A METAL WORKER OR AN AUTO WORKER, BUT STILL, GETTING THOSE SKILLS AND THAT EDUCATION AND GETTING THE CREDENTIALS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY. WE JUST HAVE TO GET BACK TO MAKING IT AFFORDABLE AND OPEN FOR EVERYBODY WILLING TO WORK FOR IT. IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NOW, WE HAVE THE COSTS ARE SO HIGH. SOME OF THE FOR-PROFIT SCHOOLS. SOME OF THE SCANDALS THAT HAVE ARISEN WHERE THEY TAKE ALL THIS MONEY AND PUT ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES INTO DEBT. EVEN IF THEY GRADUATE, THEY DO NOT HAVE CREDENTIALS THAT WILL GIVE THEM THOSE JOBS. OR THEY CAN'T GRADUATE BECAUSE THE OTHER COSTS ARE TOO GREAT. SO THEY DROPOUT BUT THEY STILL HAVE THE DEBT, AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE DEGREE. SO WE'VE GOT TO SORT THIS OUT, AND TAKE ON THOSE INTERESTS THAT WANT TO KEEP THE SYSTEM THE WAY THIS BECAUSE IT GENERATES A LOT OF MONEY AND INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR THEM. AND INSTEAD, GET BACK TO BASIS. HOW DO WE HAVE -- AN OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM? WE HAVE TO START THAT IN PREKINDERGARTEN. WE HAVE TO GIVE MORE KIDS THE CHANCE TO GET READY. WE WE HAVE TO START AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHERE YOU HAVE TO REALIZE YOU ARE GOING TO BABIES BRAIN BY TALKING AND READING AND SINGING TO THAT BABY. MY POOR GRANDDAUGHTER, HER FIRST WORDS ARE GOING TO BE, STOP IT. WE KNOW NEURONS ARE FIRING AND CONNECTIONS ARE BEING MADE. BY THE TIME A CHILD GETS TO KINDERGARTEN, MUCH OF THE VOCABULARY'S BEEN FORMED. A LOT OF. THEIR BRAIN TO ELEMENT HAS OCCURRED SO WE NEED AN OPPORTUNITY FROM BIRTH THROUGH LIFELONG ADULT LEARNING. WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING THAT IN COMING UP WITH THE BEST WAYS TO CREATE THE KIND OF PARTNERSHIP THAT YOU HAVE HERE IN MORE PLACE S. AND KIND OF FLESH OUT THE BAD ACTORS WHO ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF STUDENTS AND NOT REALLY PROVIDING MUCH IN IN RETURN AND LIFT UP THE GOOD ACTORS LIKE KIRKWOOD. HOW DO YOU SEE ALL THIS? MITCH: LET ME COMMENT. BESIDES WHAT WE DO DURING THE DAY, WE HAVE OVER 1000 STUDENTS TAKING CONTINUING ED. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIFELONG LEARNING, THERE IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYBODY TO KEEP THEIR BRAIN ACTIVE. BUT I'VE BEEN IN EDUCATION FOR A LONG TIME, 46 YEARS. AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IS WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THIS OPPORTUNITY SYSTEMS. NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO FIT INTO THAT SAME MOLD. AND WE NEED TO HAVE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THAT EACH ONE OF THESE STUDENT HAS TAKEN. WE NEED TO PROVIDE THAT IN THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY POSSIBLE. AND SO, WHEN YOU THINK PARTNERSHIPS, YOU THINK COLLABORATION, THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET IT DONE. WE DO THAT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. WE GOT ONE OF THE TAA CCP GRANTS FOR $13.5 MILLION IN IOWA TO FOCUS IN ON ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FOCUSING IN ON THAT. WHEN YOU PUT THE POWER OF THAT TOGETHER, I THINK YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND THE PRESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN IOWA, WE PUT TOGETHER A PROPOSAL THAT WE JUST ORDER TO PUT DOWN THE ROAD THAT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A WE HAVE HERE AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OTHERS OF THE STATE, BUT TO PUT THIS OPPORTUNITY IN THE ENTIRE STATE. SO DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE IN CEDAR RAPIDS OR MONTICELLO OR THE NRORTH PART OF THE STATE, YOU WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME OF THE COURSES THROUGH THE ACADEMY. SO, WE ARE SLOWLY MOVING THAT AHEAD. BEING DELIBERATE ABOUT IT. BUT I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. WE CANNOT LET BOUNDARIES DEFINE US. HILLARY CLINTON: YOU ARE SINGING MY SONG HERE. BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED A NEW VISION, NEW PARADIGM OF HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO EDUCATION THAT CAN GET PEOPLE EXCITED AGAIN INSTEAD OF WHAT IN TOO MANY PLACES HAS BECOME A BATTLE WITH A LOT OF ARGUMENTS BASED ON IDEOLOGY INSTEAD OF RESULTS. THERE HAS BEEN IT ANNOYS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH DONE IN EDUCATION. SOME REALLY GOOD DATA ABOUT WHAT WORKS. I THINK WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THAT. THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT RESULT ARE WHAT I HOPE WILL GUIDE US AS WE LOOK AT THE ROLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PLAY, BECAUSE THERE IS A WILL FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THE REAL WORK HAS TO BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. STARTING IN FAMILIES, THEN SCHOOLS, THEN COMMITTEE COLLEGES, FOUR YEAR COLLEGES. I BELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS RIPE FOR THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF FRUSTRATION. YOU MENTIONED NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. THERE WERE A LOT OF GOALS. WE HAVE LEARNED WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT WORK. WE ALL TO FOCUS ON THE FORMER. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE A SYSTEM THAT HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL AND HAS PRODUCED SO MANY POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR SO MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND JUST GET DOWN TO REALLY SORTING OUT HOW WE WORK TOGETHER INSTEAD OF ARGUING ABOUT EDUCATION, HOW WE WERE TOGETHER, GET EVERYBODY ACTING IN GOOD FAITH AROUND THE TABLE AND TRY TO SORT IT OUT BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES, THOSE ARE UNIQUELY AMERICAN INVENTION. THAT IS WHY AM REALLY STARTING HERE, BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT AMERICAN EDUCATION AND AMERICAN INNOVATION AND CREATING JOBS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD DID. NOW, I'VE SPENT YEARS TELLING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, LOOK OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT CAUGHT UNDER THE FIGURE. UNTIL THEY DO, LET'S MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE AND IN PARTNERSHIP. AND I'M THRILLED TO BE STARTING THIS CAMPAIGN IN IOWA, GOING OUT, LISTENING TO PEOPLE AND LEARNING FROM ALL OF YOU WHAT WORKS, WHAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT, WITH THE PROBLEMS ARE, BUT ALSO, WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THE FUTUR AND PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN -- IF WE REALLY FOCUS ON HOW WE RECENT RESPECT EACH OTHER AGAIN, TRUST EACH OTHER AGAIN, LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AGAIN, WORK WITH EACH OTHER AGAIN, LEAVE THE IDEOLOGY AND THE PARTISANSHIP AT THE DOOR AND COME IN AND SAY, HERE ARE THE GOALS WE SHOULD HAVE. OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM -- I'M GOING TO STEAL THAT. FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE STARTED BEFORE THEY GO INTO FORMAL SCHOOL AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH IN THE EDUCATION ARENA AND AND ALL THE OTHER AREAS THAT REALLY MATTER TO MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. THAT KNOW THAT THIS A WAY FORWARD. I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU WOULD TAKE TIME OFF TO SPEND WITH ME. I WANT TO GIVE ANYBODY A CHANCE TO SAY ANY LAST-MINUTE CONCERN OR ISSUE. ANDREW, ANYTHING? SINCE YOU ARE GOING TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY, HOW YOU SEE OUR SECURITY AND SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND YOUR SERVICE? DREW: I VISITED FOR A WEEK LAST SUMMER. AFTER MEETING WITH A LOT OF THE MIDSHIPMEN THERE, I MET WITH SOME THAT I JUST FINISH THEIR FIRST YEAR. A COUPLE THAT ARE ABOUT TO GO OUT AND -- THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT. I'LL GET PLENTY OF THAT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. HILLARY CLINTON: READY TO TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY? DREW: MORE THAN READY. WHAT ABOUT YOU, ELLEN? ELLEN: ONE THING THAT COMES TO MIND WITH ME, IT DOES NOT AFFECT ME BUT MY SISTER HAS A DISABILITY. SO IN SCHOOL, IT'S HARDER FOR HER TO GRASP CONCEPTS. AND SO I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT WERE YOUR POLICIES THAT YOU HAVE FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES? TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR EDUCATION. BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR HER IF SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE SUMMER TO CONTINUE HER EDUCATION. SHE CAN CONTINUE TO RISE. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS A IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE FOR MANY STUDENTS, THERE IS RESEARCH THAT HAVE DIFFICULTIES LEARNING. WHETHER IT IS BECAUSE OF DISABILITIES OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR LIVES. THEY LOSE A LOT OF THE GROUND THAT THEY GAINED DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR BECAUSE DURING THE SUMMER THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CONSTANT STIMULATION, EDUCATION THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO KEEP LEARNING AND KEEP BUILDING. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO MUCH MORE TO REALIZE THE PROMISE THAT TOM HARKIN WAS A CHAMPION OF TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE, BUT PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, HAVE THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THEY NEED. IN AN OPPORTUNITY SOCIETY, NOT EVERYBODY LEARNS THE SAME WAY OR AT THE SAME PACE. THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO LEARNED WITH THEIR HANDS, STUDENTS WHO LEARN BY LISTENING, STUDENTS WHO NEED A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TEACHER, OTHERS WHO DO IT ONLINE. WE HAVE GOT TO START SORTING THIS OUT. FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES, WE WANT THEM TO HAVE A PLACE IN SOCIETY THAT GIVES THEM SATISFACTION AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY EVEN TO MAKE A LIVING OR MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US EXPLORE MORE WAYS THAT WE CAN USE THE EXISTING SYSTEM TO PROVIDE, WHETHER IT HAS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE OR A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT OTHER PEOPLE COME TO PART OF, SO KIDS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THAT CONTINUING SUPPORT LIKE YOUR SISTER. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT. DIANE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT OTHER POINTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE? DIANE: I THINK WE ARE VERY BLESSED TO LIVE WHERE WE DO. WHERE EDUCATION STARTING VERY YOUNG THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, THIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE HAVE ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE ARE FORTUNATE HERE. I WORRY THAT NOT ALL OF THE AMERICAN GETS TO EXPERIENCE THIS TREASURE WE HAVE. AND I THINK THE COMMON CORE IS A WONDERFUL STUFF IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. OF IMPROVING AMERICAN EDUCATION. AND IT'S PAINFUL TO SEE THAT ATTACKED. I'M WONDERING WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BRING THAT HEART BACK TO EDUCATION? WHAT CAN WE DO SO THAT PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES BELIEVE IN AMERICAN EDUCATION AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE RESPECTED AND ARE COLLEGES ARE RESPECTED? AND WE OFFER A QUALITY EDUCATION TO ALL AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES? HILLARY CLINTON: WOW. THAT IS REALLY A POWERFUL, TOUCHING COMMENT THAT I EMBRACE. YOU KNOW, WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE REALLY UNFORTUNATE ARGUMENT THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON AROUND COMMON CORE, IT'S VERY PAINFUL BECAUSE THE COMMON CORE STARTED OFF AS A BIPARTISAN EFFORT. IT WAS ACTUALLY NONPARTISAN. IT WASN'T POLITICIZED. IT WAS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A CORE OF LEARN THAT WE MIGHT EXPECT STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY WERE IN, NO MATTER HOW POOR THEIR FAMILY WAS, THAT THERE WO ULDN'T BE TWO TIERSE OF EDUCATION. EVERYBODY WOULD BE LOOKING AT WHAT WOULD BE LEARNED DOING THEIR BEST TO ACHIEVE THAT. I THINK PART OF THE REASON WHY IOWA MAY BE MORE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS YOU HAVE HAD THE IOWA CORE FOR YEARS. U.S. HAD A SYSTEM PLUS THE IOWA ASSESSMENT TEST. I THINK I'M RIGHT IN SAYING THAT I TOOK THOSE WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THE IOWA TESTS. SO THAT IOWA HAS HAD A TESTING SYSTEM BASED ON A CORE CURRICULUM FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. YOU SEE THE VALUE OF IT. YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THAT HELPS YOU ORGANIZE YOUR WHOLE EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND A LOT OF STATES, UNFORTUNATELY, HAVEN'T HAD THAT. SO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF A CORE IN THE SENSE, A COMMON CORE, Y ES,ES, OF COURSE, YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY IN YOUR COMMUNITY TO REACH -- PUT YOUR QUESTION IS A LARGER ONE. HOW DO WE END UP AT A POINT WHERE WE ARE SO NEGATIVE ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT, NON-FAMILY ENTERPRISE AND THE RAISING OF THE NEXT GENERATION WHICH IS HOW OUR KIDS ARE EDUCATED? THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPLANATIONS, I SUPPOSE, BUT WHENEVER THEY ARE, WE NEED TO GET BACK INTO A BROAD CONVERSATION WHERE PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AGAIN AND TRY TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS IN MONTICELLO ARE NOT THE SAME PROBLEMS YOU WILL FIND IN THE INNER CITY OF OUR BIGGEST URBAN AREAS. THAT IS A GIVEN. WE HAVE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. IT SHOULD ALL BE DRIVEN BY THE SAME COMMITMENT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE DO EDUCATE EVERY CHILD. THAT IS WHY I WAS A SENATOR AND VOTED FOR, YOU KNOW, LEAVE NO CHILD BEHIND BECAUSE I THOUGHT EVERY CHILD SHOULD MATTER AND SHOULDN'T BE YOU ARE POOR OR YOU HAVE DISABILITIES SO WE WILL SWEEP YOU TO THE BACK, DON'T SHOW UP ON TEST DAY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO MESS UP OUR SCORES, NO, EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY. I THINK WE TO GET BACK TO BASICS AND HAVE TO LOOK TO TEACHERS TO LEAD THE WAY ON THAT. YOU ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE 21, 15, 40 -- 46 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. >> OH, GOSH. CLINTON: I THINK YOU MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT OBSERVATION ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING AND WHAT I HOPE I CAN DO IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND AS PRESIDENT. STEPHANIE? STEPHANIE: I'M WONDERING WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO OR WHAT THE SCHOOLS CAN DO TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF, SINGLE MOTHERS THAT ARE ARE STRUGGLING TO BETTER THEMSELVES AND BETTER THEIR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW, WHEN KIND OF ADVANTAGES CAN THEY HELP WITH? CLINTON: WELL, I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROGRAM I STARTED WHEN I LIVED IN ARKANSAS. AND WHEN I WAS TEACHING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS. AND I GOT TO KNOW A LOT OF THE STUDENTS WHO WERE SINGLE PARENTS, PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN, NOT ALL BUT MOSTLY. AND WHO WERE TRYING TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES, WORK AND GO TO SCHOOL AND IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT. SO I STARTED SOMETHING CALLED THE ARKANSAS SINGLE PARENT SCHOLARSHIP FUND. AND WE RAISED MONEY FIRST IN THE COUNTY WHERE I LIVED AND WHERE THE UNIVERSITY WAS AND NOW IT AS STATEWIDE PROGRAM IN ARKANSAS AND PEOPLE GIVE MONEY TO SUPPLEMENT THE NEEDS OF SINGLE PARENTS. IT IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. IF YOU ARE A SINGLE PARENT AND YOU HAVE AN OLD CLUNKY CAR AND IT BREAKS DOWN AND CAN'T BE FIXED, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY TO BUY A NEW CAR OR GET IT TOWED HERE TO TRY AND FIX IT? EITHER WAY, RIGHT? OR YOU HAVE CHILDCARE AND YOUR CHILDCARE FALLS APART, THE PERSON WHO YOU TRUSTED TO LOOK AFTER YOUR KIDS IS MOVING OR ARE GENTLEMENNING A DIFFERENT JOB. -- ARE GETTING A DIFFERENT JOB. WHERE DOES THE MONEY FROM THAT COME FROM? THE SINGLE PARENT SCHOLARSHIP FUND PROVIDES THESE KINDS OF EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND I THINK THE LAST TIME I CHECKED IT HELPED 35,000 SINGLE PARENTS GO TO COLLEGE, EITHER COMMUNITY AND GET THEIR ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE, FOUR YEAR AND GET THEIR BACHELOR'S AND IT HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER. FOR SO MANY PEOPLE YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN AND TRYING TO DO THIS AND MANAGE IT AND IT IS NOT EASY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT KIND OF PROGRAM AVAILABLE IN EVERY STATE AND IT IS ALL DONATIONS. IT IS EVERYBODY JUST CONTRIBUTES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP. AND EVERY COUNTY RUNS THEIR OWN VERSION OF THAT. STEPHANIE: EVEN WITH EMPLOYERS, IF YOU COULD GO OUT AND GET A FULL-TIME JOB AND STILL GO TO SCHOOL IF EMPLOYERS WERE WILLING TO WORK AROUND THE SCHOOL SCHEDULE RATHER THAN SAY NO, YOUR HOURS ARE 9:00 TO 5:00 OR 3:00 TO 11:00 OR WHATEVER. IF THEY HELPED YOU OUT LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE SUCH AN ADVANTAGE TO PEOPLE MYSELF. CLINTON: AND CREATE MORE LOYALTY AMONG EMPLOYEES. BE ROLLING OUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLICIES ABOUT HOW TO HELP FAMILIES BALANCE WORK AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT BUSINESS ALSO HAS TO STEP UP BECAUSE I THINK MANY BUSINESSES I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ALL BUT MANY BUSINESSES COULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE AND MORE UNDERSTANDING AND MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THE STRESSES THAT ARE ON MODERN FAMILIES TODAY. I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO INCENTIVE SIZE SOME OF THOSE BEHAVIORS SO THAT BUSINESS GET SOME SUPPORT FOR DOING AN APPROACH THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN ONE THEY WOULD PREFER BECAUSE IT IS EASIER IF YOU JUST COME AT 9:00 AND LEAVE AT 5:00 OR COME AT 3:00 AND LEAVE AT 11:00 AND UP WITH OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW IS THAT A LOT OF PLACES THERE IS NO PREDICTABILITY FOR SCHEDULE AT ALL. PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION YOU ARE IN NOW RAISING THREE KIDS, DOING YOUR WORK AND GOING TO CAL AND SUPPOSE YOU ARE WORKING AT A PLACE THAT CALLS YOU UP THE NIGHT BEFORE AND SAYS I DON'T NEED YOU TOMORROW DON'T SHOW UP SO YOU DON'T GET PAID OR CALL YOU UP AND SAY I WANT YOU TO COME ON TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY FROM 3:00 TO 11:00 AND YOU SAY I HAVE A CLASS AT 6:00, TO BAD YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP. PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT IS NOT RIGHT. THERE SHOULD BE PREDICTABILITY IN EMPLOY AND FLEXIBILITY ON THE SIDE OF THE EMPLOYER. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DO THAT. DREW? DREW: I WANT TO COMMENT ON HOW GREAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT CAREER FIELDS. YOU CAN ELIMINATE YOUR OPTIONS AND FINALLY TONIGHT, OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO GO TO AND SPEND THE MONEY TO GO TO SCHOOL FOR ALONG WITH THE JOB SHADOWS AND INTERNSHIPS AND GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT IS OUT THERE AND GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE AND REALLY GET A GOOD EDUCATION ON WHAT THERE IS AS WELL AS THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES FOR THE EDUCATION FROM THE PROGRAM. CLINTON: IT HAS REALLY BEEN A BIG PLUS FOR YOU, YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE IT HELPED YOU NOT ONLY LEARN SKILLS BUT HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN FUTURE? DREW: YES. CLINTON: JASON? JASON: ON THE DRIVE OVER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT. WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU IN IOWA. I KNOW IOWANS ARE PRAGMATIC PROUD PEOPLE I HAVE TO USE THE BEST WORD I CAN IS LIKE WE ARE JUST REGULAR PEOPLE AND APPRECIATE THAT YOU CAME HERE ON THE FIRST STOP AND COMING TO KIRKWOOD IS HUGE AND ONE REQUEST THAT I WOULD HAVE AS YOU START CAMPAIGNING AND MOVING AROUND IS REMEMBER THIS KID RIGHT HERE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE A LAWYER, IF YOU ARE DOCTOR, NO ONE HAS EVER DONE THAT JOB. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND PEOPLE GO I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT. IN EDUCATION, EVERYONE HAS BEEN IN SCHOOL SO EVERYONE FEELS LIKE THEY KNOW WHEN EDUCATION SHOULD BE. THAT IS GOOD AND ALSO PROBLEMATIC WHEN TRYING TO MAKE CHANGE. ONE THING THAT I HOPE YOU FOCUS ON NOT ONLY IN IOWA BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY EDUCATION IS REALLY I BELIEVE THE KEY TO EVERYTHING WE DO. THINK ABOUT IT, YOU ARE A TEACHER WHEN YOU WENT TO OTHER CUP INTERESTS AND TALKED TO THEM ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON YOU ARE TEACHING ABOUT WHEN IS GOING ON HERE. YOUR STUDENTS WERE THE WORLD. YOU WILL BE DOING THAT AS YOU MOVE ACROSS STATE AND COUNTRY AND HELP EVERYONE REMEMBER THAT EDUCATION IS HEART OF EVERYTHING WE DO AND WE NEED TO REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF THAT WHETHER HERE AT KIRKWOOD OR IN A HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE SETTING, I THINK EDUCATION SHOULD BE A BIG PART OF WHAT YOU ARING TO AND I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO DO THAT. CLINTON: ABSOLUTELY. BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED HEART ABOUT EDUCATION AND IT REALLY IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT I THINK WOULD NEED TO STAND FOR AND THE VALUES WE NEED TO PURSUE IN OUR COUNTRY AND I JUST WANT US TO TRUST AND RESPECT ESPECIALLY OUR TEACHERS AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THESE PATHWAYS FOR OPPORTUNITY. AND YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN SUCH A FAST-MOVING WORLD RIGHT NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO, DREW, WHEN YOU GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO WHEN YOU ARE JASON'S AGE OR WHAT ANDREW DECIDES IT DO COMING OUT OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY MAY NOT BE THE SAME OR ELLEN YOU MAY DECIDE TO USE YOUR EDUCATION FOR SOMETHING ELSE. THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF OUR SYSTEM. WE DO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. AND THERE IS NOT MANY OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT REALLY DO HAVE THAT. BUT WITH THAT FLEXIBILITY COMES A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE WELL PREPARED SO THAT THEY CAN BE ON A TRAJECTORY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO MAKE THE CHOICES THAT ARE BEST FOR THEM AS THEY GROW UP. AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SEE AGAIN. I NEVER DOUBTED THAT. WHEN I WAS, YOU KNOW, GROWING UP IN ILLINOIS, I NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF I GOT A GOOD EDUCATION THAT WAS PREACHED INTO ME EVERY SINGLE DAY BY MY PARENTS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD BE DOING. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SITTING HERE TELLING YOU I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BUT I KNEW THAT IF I GOT A GOOD EDUCATION I DID MY PART. I HAD TO WORK HARD I'M NOT JUSTCYING AROUND LETTING SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT BUT IF I DID THAT THIS COUNTRY HELD OUT SO MUCH PROMISE FOR ME. AND IT THEN WOULD BE UP TO ME TO TRY TO FIND MY WAY FORWARD AND MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT WERE BEST FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR EVERYBODY. I HAVE THIS NEW GRAND DAUGHTER AND I WANT HER TO HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY BUT I WASN'T EVERY CHILD IN OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT I DECIDED TO RUN BECAUSE BELIEVE ME I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY, THAT I WILL HAVE TO WORK HARD TO EARN EVERY SINGLE VOTE AND GET EVERY CAUCUS GOER I CAN ROUND UP TO SHOW UP NEXT FEBRUARY BUT I JUST FELT LIKE I COULDN'T WALK AWAY FROM WHAT I SEE AS THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND I WANT TO BUILD ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO GET OUT OF THE TERRIBLE RECESSION AND GET BACK ON OUR FEET. BUT WE HAVE TO RUN THE RACE. AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHOSE VIEWS ABOUT HOW WE RUN THAT RACE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY TO BE MAKE THE DECISIONS. SO I'M HERE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO TRAVELING AROUND THE STATE AND I THINK I WILL GO TO A FEW MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND LEARN SOME MORE BY TALKING TO THE PEOPLE AND SEEING WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND FINDING IDEAS THAT NO ONLY WORK IN IOWA BUT CAN WORK ANYWHERE. SO, THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CLINTON: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THESE WEEKEND,",2015-11-07 17:41:33,2015-04-14,Monticello,Iowa

[APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR HUTCHISON: THANK YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY EXCITING DAY FOR HOPE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A GREAT DAY FOR ARKANSAS. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR OUR NATION. [APPLAUSE] I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE, JUST AS YOU ARE PLEASED TO BE HERE, TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT TO MIKE AND JANET HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] 23 YEARS AGO, MIKE HUCKABEE DROVE UP FROM TEXARKANA TO MY OFFICE WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY, AND HE SAID, ASA, I WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS. I WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE. I DIDN'T TELL HIM, BUT I THOUGHT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. AND I SAW MY CUT COULD BE GO FROM A CANDIDATE -- SAW MIKE HUCKABEE GO FROM A CANDIDATE, TO A LEADER, TO A GOVERNOR, TO A GREAT NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. I'VE BEEN GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS FOR A LITTLE OVER 100 DAYS. DURING THAT TIME, I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF GOVERNING WITH A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND REPUBLICANS HOLDING THE OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL FOR ME, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, EVEN WITH A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, BEING GOVERNOR IS STILL A TOUGH JOB. I THINK BACK TO WHEN MIKE HUCKABEE WAS GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE FOR 10 YEARS AS A REPUBLICAN LEADER WITH A DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE, WHEN ARKANSAS WAS AS BLUE AS ANY STATE IN THE NATION. THOSE WERE TOUGH TIMES. MIKE HUCKABEE CAME INTO OFFICE TO GOVERN IN A BIPARTISAN WAY AND TO LEAD OUR STATE IN TROUBLING TIMES. HE LED OUR STATE WITH CONVICTION. HE LED OUR STATE WITH CONSERVATIVE VALUES. HE LOWERED TAXES. HE BALANCED OUR BUDGET FOR 10 YEARS. HE REFORMED EDUCATION. HE PRESERVED OUR HUNTING AND OUTDOOR CULTURE IN THIS STATE. HE LED OUR STATE AND HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AS A LEADER OF ARKANSAS. AND HE DID THAT, AGAIN, WHENEVER HE HAD TO REACH OUT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND SAY, JOIN ME IN THIS EFFORT. THAT IS THE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP THAT WE NEED ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] ""TIME"" MAGAZINE CALLED HIM ONE OF THE BEST GOVERNORS IN AMERICA. AND THEY WERE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. AND HE TOOK HIS -- [APPLAUSE] HE TOOK HIS LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AND WE, IN ARKANSAS, HAVE BEEN PROUD OF THE WAY HE HAS REPRESENTED US, HE HAS REPRESENTED OUR VALUES, AND HE HAS POINTED THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, HE HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY WHOM WE HAVE KNOWN AS THE WONDERFUL FIRST LADY, JANET HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] AND TODAY, WE ALL THINK ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TROUBLESOME TIMES AHEAD FOR OUR NATION. WE NEED A LEADER OF OUR COUNTRY WHO IS STEADY ON THEIR FEET, STUDY WITH THEIR CONVICTIONS, HAS A VISION FOR AMERICA WITH GOOD, CONSERVATIVE VALUES, AND WHO IS A PROVEN LEADER. MIKE HUCKABEE HAS EVERY ONE OF THOSE QUALITIES AND WILL MAKE A GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. OUR COUNTRY NEEDS THE LEADERSHIP OF MIKE HUCKABEE, AND WITH JANET BY HIS SIDE, MIKE AND JANET, WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT ARKANSAS IS ON YOUR SIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) >> AFTER OUR FIRST YEAR OF MARRIAGE, I STARTED EXPERIENCING SOME BACK PAIN. YOU DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THE WORD CANCER. ANY CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THE WORD MALIGNANT. I THINK MIKE REALLY WAS THE HERO IN ALL OF IT BECAUSE HE WOULD GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING, PACK ME INTO THE CAR. AND THEN BRING ME BACK HOME, AND BE IN CLASS THAT MORNING. PLUS HOLD A JOB DOWN. IFE SHOU HLDLEFT ME, HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT RIGHT THEN. AND HE CHOSE TO STICK IT OUT. SO, HE MADE A PROMISE TO ME, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, IN SICKNESS OR IN HEALTH. HE HAD TO LIVE UP TO THAT PROMISE RIGHT THEN IN OUR FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF MARRIAGE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN GO THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND NOT GET STRONGER. THE ONE THING I DID LEARN ABOUT MIKE IS HIS LEADERSHIP QUALITIES. HE HAD THE CAPACITY TO TAKE ANY SITUATION, LOOK AT IT, AND IT'S SEE HOW EACH DECISION HE COULD MAKE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD COULD AFFECT THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE. OUR STATE INHERITED 75,000 PEOPLE IN JUST A FEW DAYS. MIKE INSTANTLY SAID I WANTED ALL MY FAITH LEADERS TO COME FORWARD, ANY DENOMINATION THAT HAD A CAMP, FOR INSTANCE, WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEDS, PLAYGROUNDS, CAFETERIAS. HE SAID, I NEED YOU TO OPEN UP. EVERY CAMP BECAME ANOTHER LITTLE TOWN. THEY LOVED HIM. THEY TOOK THEM IN. SO MUCH SO THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. PEOPLE FIRST, PAPERWORK LATER. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PARTS OF REALLY RUNNING FOR ANY OFFICE, BUT PRIMARILY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, IS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO GIVE UP SOMETHING IN ORDER TO DO IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK. BUT I AM ALWAYS REMINDED OF THE SONG THAT SAID, MAY ALL WHO COME BEHIND US FIND US FAITHFUL. I HOPE THAT EVEN THOSE HEADLINES THAT MY CHILDREN, MY GRANDCHILDREN WILL SEE, THAT THEY WILL SEE THAT WE WERE FAITHFUL. NOT JUST WHAT WE WERE GIVEN AS GOVERNOR AND FIRST LADY, AS MOM AND DAD, OR AS A GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER, BUT THAT WE WERE FAITHFUL AND RUNNING OUR CAMPAIGN, THAT WE DID IT, YOU KNOW, TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES, BUT DID IT WITH GOOD CHARACTER AND NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT. AND TO BE PROUD OF WHAT WE DID. (music)[APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] JANET HUCKABEE: YOU DO KNOW I AM NOT THE MAIN EVENT, DON'T YOU? THANK YOU SO MUCH. IMAGINE YOURSELF AT A DINNER, AND YOUR DINNER GUESTS WERE GEORGE WASHINGTON, JOHN ADAMS, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, AND THOMAS JEFFERSON. AND YOU HAD 30 MINUTES TO DEFEND AMERICA. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO DEFEND AMERICA? WOULD YOU SAY THAT AMERICA IS GREAT? WOULD YOU SAY THE ECONOMY IS SOARING? WOULD YOU SAY OUR VALUE SYSTEM IS SOLID? OR WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS BEING TRAMPLED? THERE IS FIGHTING IN THE STREETS, CONGRESS IS DOING NOTHING. THE UNBORN IS NOT PROTECTED. AND THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP IN THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] WHERE IS THE PASSION THAT THOSE FOREFATHERS HAD? WHEN THEY LEFT THE COUNTRY TO COME AND START AMERICA. DO WE HAVE PASSIONS THE TODAY THAT THEY HAD? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD DIE FOR THAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN FIGHT TODAY FOR EVERYDAY WHEN THEY GO FIGHT? DO WE STILL HAVE THAT PASSION? AMERICA IS A GREAT STORY, BUT I THINK IT CAN BE GREATER. MIKE AND I STARTED OUR STORY RIGHT HERE IN HOPE, ARKANSAS. I MOVED HERE WHEN I WAS ONE AND A HALF. MY MOM HAD FIVE KIDS. IN SEVEN YEARS. THEY ARE ALL HERE TODAY. I AM VERY GRATEFUL. [APPLAUSE] PERHAPS SHE NEEDED CABLE TV, I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE HAD FIVE KIDS IN SEVEN YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY, SHE HAD THE RAISE THOSE KIDS WITHOUT GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE BY HERSELF. BUT MIKE AND I WERE EDUCATED HERE IN HOPE, ARKANSAS. AND ON GENERALLY 29, 1973, I HAD MY FIRST DATE. HE HAD TO WAIT FOR MY BASKETBALL GAME TO GET FINISHED. [LAUGHTER] AND HE HAD TO WAIT FOR ME TO CLEAN UP AND SHOWER. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, ALL OF THE RESTAURANTS IN HOPE, ARKANSAS WERE CLOSED. AND WE HAD TO TRAVEL TO FULTON, ARKANSAS, WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER, TO A 24-HOUR TRUCKSTOP. [LAUGHTER] I MIGHT ADD, IT WAS VERY QUIET AND ROMANTIC. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT WAS PERFECT FOR ME. AND THAT FOLLOWING YEAR, WE GOT MARRIED. AS YOU SAW IN THE VIDEO, THAT WAS 41 YEARS AGO. BUT I'M GOING FOR THE GOLD. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IN NINE YEARS, THAT COULD BE 50. I AM NOT TOO FAR OFF. WITH MY HISTORY OF CANCER, I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T MAKE IT TO 20, SO I REALLY EXCITED NOW THAT I MIGHT MAKE A 50 YEAR ANNIVERSARY. YOU SEE, WE HAVE LIVED THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND EVERYBODY OUGHT TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. BUT WITH THAT BATTLE OF CANCER, AND LATER WHEN WE HEARD WE MAY NOT HAVE CHILDREN, I FOUND OUT RIGHT AWAY I WAS PREGNANT WITH OUR FIRST SON. AND MIKE AND I DECIDED RIGHT AWAY THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM. [INDISCERNIBLE] HE HAD TO SELL THOSE GUITARS. AND HE MADE A SACRIFICE FOR US. AND WE HAD A WASHER AND DRYER. SEE, THAT IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT RIGHT AWAY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT, YOU FIND A WAY TO DO IT. AND YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY. I HAVE THREE WONDERFUL CHILDREN. SOON TO HAVE FIVE GRANDCHILDREN THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF. HE TOOK CARE OF THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY TIME MAGAZINE NAMED HIM ONE OF THE BEST GOVERNORS IN ERICAM [APPLAUSE] AMERICA IS A GREAT COUNTRY. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IT GREATER. WHAT STORY ARE WE GOING TO TELL? THAT WE GAVE UP? OR THAT WE FOUGHT WITH GREAT PASSION LIKE OUR FOREFATHERS DID? THAT IS IMPORTANT. THAT IS THE STORY WE HAVE TO TELL. OUR PRESIDENT PROMISED AMERICANS HOPE. OUR NEXT PRESIDENT SHOULD GIVE EVERY AMERICAN AND TAKE THEM FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS. [APPLAUSE] I LOVE YOU. (music) (music) >> GOVERNOR HUCKABEE'S DOOR WAS NAILED SHUT. IT WAS IN BILL CLINTON'S ARKANSAS. HE HAD HUGE MAJORITIES, ALL THE APPARATUS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALIGNED AGAINST MIKE. THIS REPUBLICAN COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND WINS. EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE AND POLITICS WAS A FIGHT. SOMETIMES IT WAS AN INTENSE ONE. ANY REDNECK CAN START A FIGHT. A LEADER ONLY STARTS A FIGHT HE IS PREPARED TO FINISH. AS GOVERNOR AS ARKANSAS I CUT TAXES AND WELFARE, AND RAISED FAMILY INCOME BY 50%. WE EMPOWERED PEOPLE TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE. I'M NOT A REPUBLICAN BECAUSE I GREW UP RICH. I'M A REPUBLICAN BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE POOR WAITING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RESCUE ME. >> ONE THING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN AMERICA IS MOVING THE POWER AWAY FROM WASHINGTON WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO DISCONNECTED FROM THE WAY THAT SO MANY ORDINARY AMERICANS LIVE. IT IS A DISASTER. POWER NEEDS TO BE LOCAL AND LIMITED. THE CLOSER GOVERNMENT IS TO THE PEOPLE, THE MORE ACCOUNTABLE IT IS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING GOVERNED. INSTEAD OF MINIMUM WAGE, I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS OR EVERY AMERICAN TO EARN HIS OR HER MAXIMUM WAGE. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. WASHINGTON HAS DONE ENOUGH LIGHTING AND STEALING. I WILL NEVER ROB SENIORS OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED. I WILL LEAD WITH MORAL CLARITY IN A DANGEROUS WORLD. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG, GOOD AND EVIL. I WILL KEEP ALL OF THE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE EVIL FORCES OF RADICAL ISLAM. WE BELIEVE IN THINGS, WE STAND BY THOSE THINGS, WE LIVE OR DIE BY THOSE THINGS. LET'S WIN THE FIGHT FOR WHAT MATTERS MOST. [APPLAUSE] [COUNTRY MUSIC] ANNOUNCER: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME NATIVE SON OF HOPE, ARKANSAS, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [CHANTING] MIKE HUCKABEE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOW. FOLKS, IT IS A LITTLE BRICK RED HOUSE ON A 2ND STREET IN HOPE ARKANSAS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] BUT HERE IN THIS SMALL TOWN CALLED HOPE, I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT WHERE A PERSON STARTED DIDN'T MEAN THAT IS WHERE HE HAD TO STOP. [APPLAUSE] I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT I KID CAN GO FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. AND LIKE A LOT OF AMERICANS, I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN THAT WAS FAR REMOVED FROM THE POWER, MONEY, AND INFLUENCE THAT RUNS THIS COUNTRY. BUT POWER, MONEY, AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE HAD LEFT A LOT OF AMERICANS LAGGING BEHIND. THEY WORK HARD, THEY LIFT HEAVY THINGS, AND THEY SWEAT THROUGH THEIR CLOTHES, BUT THEY CAN'T SEEM TO GET AHEAD OR STAY EVEN. MY PARENTS WERE LIKE THAT. MY DAD WAS NOT AN EDUCATED MAN, BUT HE WAS A SMART MAN. THEY DID NOT HAVE A WHOLE LOT, BUT THEY HAD HONESTY TO THE BONE. WE WERE TOLD TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS WE WOULD HAVE OTHERS DO UNTO US. [APPLAUSE] IT WAS HERE IN HOPE THAT I BONE. WE WERE TOLD TO DO UNTO OTHERS LEARNED TO READ, TO RIDE A BIKE, TO SWIM, AND TO PLAY FAIR. I LEARNED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG, AND I LEARNED THAT GOD LOVES ME AS MUCH AS ANYONE, BUT THAT HE DOESN'T LOVE SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I LEARNED ABOUT AMERICA. IN THIS KINDERGARTEN, AS WELL AS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, I LEARNED THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, THE LORD'S PRAYER, AND THE PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE PRAY AT THE START OF EACH DAY, AND WE PRAYED AGAIN FOR LUNCH. I LEARNED THAT THIS EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY COULD ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE PROVIDENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: IT WAS HERE IN HOPE THAT I LEARNED HOW TO HANDLE A FIREARM AND A FISHING POLE. I SPENT A LOT OF HOURS WITH BOTH. I GOT MY FIRST BB GUN AT AGE FIVE. IT WAS A DAISY MODEL 25. I STILL HAVE IT. IT IS IN MINT CONDITION. I LEARNED THE BASIC RULES OF GUN SAFETY, AND I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT USING A FIREARM TO MURDER SOMEONE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I RAN LINES ALL NIGHT SO THAT WE COULD CATCH CATFISH THAT WE WOULD FREEZE AND LIVE OFF OF FOR WEEKS. IT WAS HERE THAT I WAS BAPTIZED IN THE GARRET MEMORIAL BAPTIST CHURCH WHEN I WAS JUST 10 YEARS OLD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I TRULY WENT FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. IT WAS HERE THAT I MET THE GIRL THAT WOULD BECOME MY WIFE OF 40 YEARS AND GIVE ME THREE CHILDREN AND SHARE WHAT WILL SOON BE FIVE GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE KNEW EACH OTHER FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND WE STARTED DATING OUR SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS ALSO HERE THAT I GOT A JOB AT KXIR RADIO AT AGE 14. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT THE JOB WOULD NOT ONLY PAY MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL, BUT ALSO GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE MENTORED BY THE STATION MANAGER AND ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICANS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTY. [LAUGHTER] MIKE HUCKABEE: IT WAS HERE THAT I BECAME THE FIRST MALE IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY LINEAGE TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AT THE VERY SAME CAMPUS THAT STANDS TODAY ON MAIN STREET. AND IT WAS HERE THAT I WENT TO WASHITA BAPTIST UNIVERSITY. I ALSO RAN FOR OFFICE AT HOPE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: IT SEEMS PERFECTLY FITTING THAT IT WOULD BE HERE THAT I ANNOUNCE THAT I AM A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] [AUDIENCE CHANTING] MIKE HUCKABEE: THANK YOU. I AM GLAD YOU REACTED THAT WAY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY LONELY DAY IF YOU HAVE BEEN QUIET. IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT I YOUNG, UNTESTED, INEXPERIENCED, AND VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN FRESHMAN A SENATOR MADE GREAT SPEECHES ABOUT HOPE AND CHANGE. BUT EIGHT YEARS LATER, ARE GET MORE THAN DOUBLED, -- OUR DEBTS MORE THAN DOUBLED, OUR LEADERSHIP HAS COMPLETELY EVAPORATED, IN THE COUNTRY IS MORE POLARIZED THAN EVER IN MY LIFETIME. 93 MILLION AMERICANS DON'T HAVE JOBS AND MANY OF THEM WHO DO HAVE SEEN THEIR FULL-TIME JOB WITH BENEFITS THEY ONCE HAD BECOME TWO PART-TIME JOB WITH NO BENEFITS AT ALL. WE WERE PROMISED HOPE, BUT IT WAS JUST TALK. AND NOW WE NEED THE KIND OF CHANGE THAT REALLY COULD GET AMERICA FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: VETERANS WHO KEPT THEIR PROMISE TO AMERICA, WHO HAVE KEPT US FREE, NOW WAIT FOR MONTHS FOR OUR COUNTRIES PROMISE FOR THE SCARS FROM THE VERY WARS THAT WE SENT THEM TO FIGHT. [APPLAUSE] OUR VETERANS SHOULD BE GETTING THE FIRST SERVING FROM OUR TREASURY, NOT THE LEFTOVERS. MY FRIENDS, WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, OUR VETERANS ARE NOT GOING TO BE LEFT ON THE STREETS AND WAITING ROOMS TO ROT, BUT THEY WILL BE TREATED WITH THE DIGNITY THEY HAVE EARNED AND DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WHEN I MEET MEN WHO HAVE AN AMERICAN LEGION CAP OR ONE THAT SAYS ""VETERAN"" I NEVER TRY AND FAIL TO SAY THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME MY FREEDOM. WE OWE THEM MORE THAN A PAT ON THE BACK. WE NEED TO TAKE THEM FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] WASHINGTON IS MORE DYSFUNCTIONAL THAN EVER, AND HE DOES BECOME SO BOLD TO THE DONOR CLASS WHO HAS FILLED THE CAMPAIGN COFFERS, THAT IT IGNORES THE FACT THAT 1 IN 4 AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE PAYING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME JUST FOR HOUSING. HOME OWNERSHIP HAS THE LOWEST LEVEL IN DECADES. A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH HEAVY STUDENT DEBT ARE LIKELY TO AFFORD THEIR FIRST HOME FOR A LONG WHILE. OUR FEDERAL POLICIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AREN'T DESIGNED TO PROTECT FAMILIES, BUT RATHER TO PROTECT BUREAUCRATS. WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENROLLED IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS LIKE FOOD STAMPS, AND IT IS NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO BE IN POVERTY. IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THE BOTTOM 90% OF WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY WHOSE WAGES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT FOR THE PAST TWO 40 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THE WAR ON POVERTY HASN'T ENDED POVERTY, IT HAS PROLONGED IT. I DON'T JUDGE SUCCESS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF GOVERNMENT. I JUDGE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD JOBS AND DON'T NEED GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND WE DON'T CREATE GOOD JOBS FOR AMERICAN BY S BY ENTERING INTO UNBALANCED TRADE DEALS THAT FORGO CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY AND THEN LOOK OVER THE LOSS OF THAT WE CAN IMPORT LOW-WAGE LABOR, UNDERCUT AMERICAN WORKERS, AND DRIVER WAGES LOWER THAN THE DEAD SEA. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO, I COVERED IN A STATE THAT WAS THE MOST LOPSIDED AND PARTISAN IN THE COUNTRY. NO REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR HAD MORE DEMOCRATS. I CHALLENGE THE POLITICALLY ENTRENCHED MACHINE THAT RAN THIS STATE. IT WAS TOUGH SLEDDING, BUT I LEARNED HOW TO GOVERN, AND I LEARNED HOW TO LEAD. EVEN IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, WE PASSED 94 TAX CUTS, REBUILT OUR ROAD SYSTEM, SAW DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT TEXT SCORES, AND FOUGHT SO THAT WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE WOULD BE GIVEN A FAIR SHAKE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE SAW FAMILY INCOME INCREASED BY 50% DURING MY TENURE. THERE ARE SOME WHO PROPOSE THAT TO SAVE THE SAFETY NETS LIKE MEDICARE AND SECURITY, WE OUGHT TO CHOP OFF THE PAYMENTS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SAFELY HAVE THEIR PAYCHECKS WAITING FOR THEM WHEN THEY ARE OLD AND SICK. MY FRIEND, YOU ARE FORCED TO PAY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE FOR 50 YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT GRABS THE MONEY FROM OUR PAYCHECKS AND SAYS IT WILL BE WAITING FOR US WHEN WE TURN 65. IF CONGRESS WANTS TO TAKE AWAY SOMEONE'S RETIREMENT, LET THEM TAKE THEIR OWN CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS, NOT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. BECAUSE HOW CAN ANYONE EVER TRUST GOVERNMENT AGAIN, IF THEY STEAL FROM US AND LIE TO US? IT DIDN'T HELP WHEN CONGRESS TOOK $700 BILLION OUT OF MEDICARE TO PAY FOR OBAMACARE. AND INSTEAD OF HELPING FAMILIES FIND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, WE CREATED A MONSTER THAT FORCES US TO BUY COVERAGE THAT WE DON'T WANT, DON'T NEED, AND CAN'T AFFORD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND IMAGINE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BOASTING THEY WILL FIGHT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, AND THEN TURNING AROUND AND SIGNING UP FOR IT. REAL HEALTH CARE REFORM IS GOING TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND TOURS CURES RATHER THAN COSTLY INTERVENTION. BECAUSE HOPE COMES FROM FINDING CURES FOR CANCER, DIABETES, ALZHEIMER'S, THE SAME WAY THAT WE ONCE LINED UP AT THE COURTHOUSE IN THE 1950S AND TOOK OUR VACCINES TO ERADICATE POLIO. REAL CURES CAN GIVE HOPE TO FAMILIES WHO HEAR A DREADED DIAGNOSIS AND ARE SENTENCED TO A SLOW AND AGONIZING DEATH. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ALONE WILL COST WELL OVER $1 TRILLION BY THE YEAR 2050. FOCUSING ON CURES INSTEAD OF TREATMENTS SAVES MONEY, LIVES, AND FAMILIES. I REMEMBER PRESIDENT KENNEDY TELLING US THAT WE WOULD SEND A MAN TO THE MOON AND BRING HIM HOME IN A DECADE. PRESIDENT KENNEDY DID NOT LIVE TO SEE THAT COME TRUE, BUT I DID. AND IT MADE ME BELIEVE THAT AMERICA COULD DO ANYTHING IT SET ITS MIND TO. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND AS PRESIDENT, AS PRESIDENT I WOULD LAUNCH A CURATIVE APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE, SAVE MONEY AND LIVES, NOT JUST A BUNCH OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE FACE REAL THREATS FROM RADICAL JIHADISM IN THE FORM OF GROUPS LIKE ISIS AN D STATE TERRORISTD LIKE IRAN. BUT WE PUT MORE PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO BUILDING BEDROOMS FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN JUDEA THEN WE PUT ON IRAN FOR BUILDING A BOMB. DEALING WITH RADICALS WHO CHANT ""DEATH TO AMERICA"" AND FUND ROCKETS TO MURDER CIVILIANS IN ISRAEL IS NONSENSE. WHEN I HEAR MY PRESIDENT SAY HE WANTS CHRISTIANS TO GET OFF THEIR HIGH HORSE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE NICE WITH RADICAL JIHADISTS, I WONDER. [BOOING] MIKE HUCKABEE: I WONDER IF YOU COULD WATCH A WESTERN FROM THE 50'S AND FIGURE OUT WHO THE GOOD GUYS AND BAD GUYS REALLY ARE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL NO LONGER MERELY TRY TO CONTAIN JIHADISM, WE WILL CONQUER IT. [CHEERING] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE WILL DEAL WITH JIHADIS JUST THE WAY WE WOULD DEAL WITH DEADLY SNAKES. LET THERE BE NO DOUBT, ISRAEL WILL KNOW, AS WILL BE WHOLE WORLD, THAT WE ARE THEIR TRUSTED FRIEND AND THE AYATOLLAHS OF IRAN WILL KNOW THAT HELL WILL FREEZE OVER BEFORE THEY GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. [CHEERING] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND I COMMIT THIS TO YOU TODAY -- I WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA, EVER. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE FACE NOT ONLY THE THREATS FROM TERRORISM, BUT ALSO THE THREAT OF NEW KINDS OF DANGERS. FROM A CYBER WAR THAT COULD SHUT DOWN MAJOR FINANCIAL MARKETS, TO THREATS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE FROM AN EXPLODED DEVICE THAT COULD FRY THE ELECTRICAL GRID AND TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK TO THE STONE AGE IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. WAITING UNTIL IT HAPPENS IS TOO LATE. BUT WE HAVE LOST OUR WAY MORALLY. WE HAVE WITNESSED THE SLAUGHTER OF OVER 55 MILLION BABIES IN THE NAME OF CHOICE, AND WE ARE NOW THREATENING THE FOUNDATION OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BY CRIMINALIZING CHRISTIANITY AND ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD ABANDON BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: MANY OF OUR POLITICIANS HAVE SURRENDERED TO THE FALSE GOD OF JUDICIAL SUPREMACY, WHICH WOULD ALLOW UNELECTED JUDGES TO MAKE LAWS AS WELL AS ENFORCE IT, UPENDING THE BALANCE OF POWERS SO ESSENTIAL TO THE CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT THE SUPREME BEING. AND THEY CANNOT OVERTURN THE LAWS OF NATURE OR OF NATURE'S GOD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON IS DYSFUNCTIONAL BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME THE ROACH MOTEL. PEOPLE COME IN, BUT THEY NEVER COME OUT. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT FOR TERM LIMITS ON ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. THAT WOULD HELP RETURN US TO THE FOUNDER'S DREAM SERVING THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE A TEMPORARY DUTY, NOT A LUCRATIVE CAREER WITH GENEROUS PENSIONS AND PACKCHECKS. IF SOMEONE IS ELECTED TO AN OFFICE, THEN GIVE THE TAXPAYERS WHAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR AND THE JOB THAT YOU SAID YOU WANTED. IF YOU LIVE OFF THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL AND WANT TO RUN FOR AN OFFICE OF THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO, THEN AT LEAST HAVE THE INTEGRITY AND DECENCY TO RESIGN ONE THAT YOU DON'T WANT ANYMORE AND PURSUE THE ONE YOU'D RATHER HAVE. [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY THE 10TH AMENDED. I WOULD ACTUALLY ABIDE BY IT. THIS POWER IS NEVER INTENDED TO BE SO CONCENTRATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. OUR CONSTITUTION IS EXPLICITLY CLEAR ABOUT KEEPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SMALL, SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON SIMPLE THINGS LIKE PROVIDING A MILITARY AND SECURING OUR BORDERS. THERE ARE THINGS BEING DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT SHOULD BE DONE AT THE STATE, OR EVEN BETTER, THE FAMILIES. WHY EVEN HAVE A FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION? IT FLUNKED, AND IT NEEDS TO BE EXPELLED. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: EDUCATION POLICY OUGHT TO BE SET BY STATE, LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS, AND BEST OF ALL, BY THE MOMS AND DADS OF THE CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND COMMON SENSE TELLS US THE BEST GOVERNMENT IS THE MOST LOCAL AND MOST LIMITED. WE SUPERSIZED THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY, BUT WE HAVEN'T DOWNSIZED THE MILITARY AND LEFT OUR BORDERS OPENED AN UNCONTROLLED. YES, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE IMMIGRATION ISSUES, BUT NOT WITH AMNESTY. WE NEED TO START TAKING CONTROL OF OUR OWN BORDERS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: BUT AS AMERICANS, WE OUGHT TO GET ON OUR KNEES EVERY NIGHT AND THANK GOD WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BREAK INTO RATHER THAN BREAK OUT OF. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING A SPEECH AND MAKING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. YOU CAN'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. YOU CAN'T BORROW MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY BACK. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO LIVE BY THE RULES THAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE BY. AND THEY SHOULD FUNCTION UNDER A BALANCED BUDGET, JUST LIKE EVERY YEAR I WAS A GOVERNOR. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I DON'T WANT TO HEAR POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT TINKERING WITH THE TAX CODES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS THAT STILL LET POWERFUL WASHINGTON INTERESTS PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. WE CAN NEVER CREATE PROSPERITY FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE, NEVER GROW OUR ECONOMY OUT OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT OF DEBT, NEVER BRING AMERICA BACK TO THE GREATEST ECONOMY ON EARTH IF WE CONTINUE TO PUNISH PRODUCTIVELY AND SUBSIDIZE RECKLESS IRRESPONSIBILITY. [APPLAUSE] THERE WAS A MAN I MET AT A MACHINE SHOP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE TOLD ME THAT HE STARTED WORKING A DOUBLE SHIFT TO HELP HIS DAUGHTER PAY FOR GRAD SCHOOL. HE FIGURED THAT IF HE WORKED 16 HOURS RATHER THAN EIGHT, HE WOULD BRING HOME TWICE THE PAY. BUT HE FOUND OUT THAT THE MONEY HE WORKED FOR ON THAT SECOND SHIFT HIM IN A NEW TAX BRACKET AND THE GOVERNMENT GOT MORE OF IT THAN HE DID. IT IS NOT THAT OUR TAX SYSTEM IS PUNISHING THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA, THEY CAN AFFORD ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS WHO FIND A WAY TO PROTECT THEM. IT IS THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR WAGES WHO CAN'T GET AHEAD IF THE GOVERNMENT PENALIZES THEM FOR TRYING TO DO BETTER. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK TO PASS THE FAIR TAX WHICH WOULD NO LONGER PENALIZE PEOPLE'S WORK. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE WOULDN'T PENALIZE PEOPLE'S WORK OR INVESTMENTS OR GOOD STEWARDSHIP. IT WOULD END BIG GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WOULD FINALLY RID OURSELVES OF THE BIGGEST BULLY IN AMERICA -- THE IRS. [CHEERING] THE IRS WOULD DISAPPEAR, AND APRIL 15 WOULD JUST BE ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL SPRING DAY. THE STRUGGLE FOR MANY FAMILIES FIGHTING WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE OUGHT TO BE. A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. WE NEED TO BE PROMOTING THE MAXIMUM WAGE, WITH A WORKER AVAILING HIMSELF TO A JOB THAT PAYS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT. ONLY BY EMPOWERING THOSE TO REACH THEIR MAXIMUM WAGE CAN WE TAKE PEOPLE FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] THIS COUNTRY HAS GOT THREE THINGS TO STAY FREE. FEED ITSELF, FUEL ITSELF, AND FIGHT FOR ITSELF. WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP OUR FARMERS FROM BEING REGULATED OUT OF BUSINESS. WE HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY RESOURCES UNDER OUR OWN FEET. IF WE COULD BRING AFFORDABLE ENERGY TO AMERICA BECOME THE LARGEST EXPORTER SO THAT AMERICANS PROSPER IN DEVELOPING THE ENERGY, AND WE AREN'T IMPOVERISHED ANYMORE BY PAYING FOR IT WHEN IT IS REDUCED BY SOME SAUDI SHEIK OR SOME RUSSIAN ROBBER BARON. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR OURSELVES BY BRINGING MANUFACTURING TO OUR OWN COMMUNITIES. THE JOURNEY THAT BEGINS IN HOPE TODAY CAN LEAD THIS NATION TO HIGHER GROUND. BUT I CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT PEOPLE BEING MY PARTNERS. MANY WHO WERE NEVER INVOLVED IN POLITICS UNTIL NOW. I WILL LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET. I HAVE NEVER HAD BEEN AND WILL NEVER BE THE FAVORITE CANDIDATE OF THOSE IN THE WASHINGTON TO WALL STREET CORRIDOR OF POWER. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I WILL BE FUNDED AND FUELED NOT BY THE BILLIONAIRES, BUT BY WORKING PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA, THAT WILL FIND OUT THAT $15 AND $20 A MONTH CONTRIBUTIONS CAN TAKE US FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: REST ASSURED, IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS, PLEASE DO IT. [LAUGHTER] BUT I KNOW MOST OF YOU CAN'T. I'M JUST GOING TO ASK YOU TO GIVE SOMETHING. IN THE NAME OF YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. I WALKED AWAY FROM IMY OWN INCOME TO DO THIS, SO I AM NOT ASKING FOR SOME SACRIFICE I AM UNWILLING TO MAKE. I DON'T HAVE A GLOBAL FOUNDATION OR A TAXPAYER-FUNDED PAYCHECK TO LIVE OFF OF. I DON'T COME FROM A FAMILY DYNASTY, BUT A WORKING FAMILY. INCOME TO DO THIS, SO I AM NOT I GREW UP BLUE-COLLAR, NOT BLUE BLOOD. I ASK YOU TO JOIN WITH ME TODAY NOT JUST SO I CAN BE PRESIDENT, BUT SO WE CAN PRESERVE THIS GREAT REPUBLIC AND SOMEDAY SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN CAN STILL GO FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I STILL REMEMBER WHEN MY DAD TOOK ME TO THE DEDICATION OF THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED ARK, NAME FOR MY BEST FRIEND LESTER WHO IS HERE TODAY. I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD, AND MY DAD SAID, SON, GOVERNORS DON'T COME DEDICATE THIS LAKE. I WILL TAKE YOU DOWN THERE TO HEAR HIM TALK. BECAUSE YOU MAY LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE, AND YOU MAY NEVER GET MEET A GOVERNOR IN PERSON. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: HAD MY DAD LIVED JUST FOUR MONTHS LONGER, HE WOULD HAVE SEEN ME DO MORE THAN MEET A GOVERNOR, HE WOULD HAVE SEEN ME BECOME THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF MY STATE. [APPLAUSE] I ALWAYS WISH HE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE. SPEND ONE NIGHT IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. I ALWAYS WANTED TO FEEL HE DID SEE THAT MOMENT FROM THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE. AND I HOPE HE IS ABLE TO WATCH IN JANUARY 27 TEEN WHEN THAT KID IS SWORN IN AS THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.. AND WITH YOUR HELP AND GOD, WE WILL MAKE THAT JOURNEY FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] (music) >>",2015-11-07 17:42:00,2015-05-05,Hope,Arkansas

GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS MIKE HUCKABEE. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. (music) >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME THE 46TH GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS, GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR HUTCHISON: THANK YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY EXCITING DAY FOR HOPE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A GREAT DAY FOR ARKANSAS. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR OUR NATION. [APPLAUSE] I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE, JUST AS YOU ARE PLEASED TO BE HERE, TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT TO MIKE AND JANET HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] 23 YEARS AGO, MIKE HUCKABEE DROVE UP FROM TEXARKANA TO MY OFFICE WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY, AND HE SAID, ASA, I WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS. I WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE. I DIDN'T TELL HIM, BUT I THOUGHT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. AND I SAW MY CUT COULD BE GO FROM A CANDIDATE -- SAW MIKE HUCKABEE GO FROM A CANDIDATE, TO A LEADER, TO A GOVERNOR, TO A GREAT NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. I'VE BEEN GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS FOR A LITTLE OVER 100 DAYS. DURING THAT TIME, I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF GOVERNING WITH A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND REPUBLICANS HOLDING THE OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL FOR ME, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, EVEN WITH A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, BEING GOVERNOR IS STILL A TOUGH JOB. I THINK BACK TO WHEN MIKE HUCKABEE WAS GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE FOR 10 YEARS AS A REPUBLICAN LEADER WITH A DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE, WHEN ARKANSAS WAS AS BLUE AS ANY STATE IN THE NATION. THOSE WERE TOUGH TIMES. MIKE HUCKABEE CAME INTO OFFICE TO GOVERN IN A BIPARTISAN WAY AND TO LEAD OUR STATE IN TROUBLING TIMES. HE LED OUR STATE WITH CONVICTION. HE LED OUR STATE WITH CONSERVATIVE VALUES. HE LOWERED TAXES. HE BALANCED OUR BUDGET FOR 10 YEARS. HE REFORMED EDUCATION. HE PRESERVED OUR HUNTING AND OUTDOOR CULTURE IN THIS STATE. HE LED OUR STATE AND HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AS A LEADER OF ARKANSAS. AND HE DID THAT, AGAIN, WHENEVER HE HAD TO REACH OUT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND SAY, JOIN ME IN THIS EFFORT. THAT IS THE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP THAT WE NEED ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] ""TIME"" MAGAZINE CALLED HIM ONE OF THE BEST GOVERNORS IN AMERICA. AND THEY WERE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. AND HE TOOK HIS -- [APPLAUSE] HE TOOK HIS LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AND WE, IN ARKANSAS, HAVE BEEN PROUD OF THE WAY HE HAS REPRESENTED US, HE HAS REPRESENTED OUR VALUES, AND HE HAS POINTED THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, HE HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY WHOM WE HAVE KNOWN AS THE WONDERFUL FIRST LADY, JANET HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] AND TODAY, WE ALL THINK ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TROUBLESOME TIMES AHEAD FOR OUR NATION. WE NEED A LEADER OF OUR COUNTRY WHO IS STEADY ON THEIR FEET, STUDY WITH THEIR CONVICTIONS, HAS A VISION FOR AMERICA WITH GOOD, CONSERVATIVE VALUES, AND WHO IS A PROVEN LEADER. MIKE HUCKABEE HAS EVERY ONE OF THOSE QUALITIES AND WILL MAKE A GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. OUR COUNTRY NEEDS THE LEADERSHIP OF MIKE HUCKABEE, AND WITH JANET BY HIS SIDE, MIKE AND JANET, WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT ARKANSAS IS ON YOUR SIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) >> AFTER OUR FIRST YEAR OF MARRIAGE, I STARTED EXPERIENCING SOME BACK PAIN. YOU DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THE WORD CANCER. ANY CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THE WORD MALIGNANT. I THINK MIKE REALLY WAS THE HERO IN ALL OF IT BECAUSE HE WOULD GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING, PACK ME INTO THE CAR. AND THEN BRING ME BACK HOME, AND BE IN CLASS THAT MORNING. PLUS HOLD A JOB DOWN. IFE SHOU HLDLEFT ME, HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT RIGHT THEN. AND HE CHOSE TO STICK IT OUT. SO, HE MADE A PROMISE TO ME, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, IN SICKNESS OR IN HEALTH. HE HAD TO LIVE UP TO THAT PROMISE RIGHT THEN IN OUR FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF MARRIAGE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN GO THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND NOT GET STRONGER. THE ONE THING I DID LEARN ABOUT MIKE IS HIS LEADERSHIP QUALITIES. HE HAD THE CAPACITY TO TAKE ANY SITUATION, LOOK AT IT, AND IT'S SEE HOW EACH DECISION HE COULD MAKE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD COULD AFFECT THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE. OUR STATE INHERITED 75,000 PEOPLE IN JUST A FEW DAYS. MIKE INSTANTLY SAID I WANTED ALL MY FAITH LEADERS TO COME FORWARD, ANY DENOMINATION THAT HAD A CAMP, FOR INSTANCE, WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEDS, PLAYGROUNDS, CAFETERIAS. HE SAID, I NEED YOU TO OPEN UP. EVERY CAMP BECAME ANOTHER LITTLE TOWN. THEY LOVED HIM. THEY TOOK THEM IN. SO MUCH SO THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. PEOPLE FIRST, PAPERWORK LATER. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PARTS OF REALLY RUNNING FOR ANY OFFICE, BUT PRIMARILY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, IS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO GIVE UP SOMETHING IN ORDER TO DO IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK. BUT I AM ALWAYS REMINDED OF THE SONG THAT SAID, MAY ALL WHO COME BEHIND US FIND US FAITHFUL. I HOPE THAT EVEN THOSE HEADLINES THAT MY CHILDREN, MY GRANDCHILDREN WILL SEE, THAT THEY WILL SEE THAT WE WERE FAITHFUL. NOT JUST WHAT WE WERE GIVEN AS GOVERNOR AND FIRST LADY, AS MOM AND DAD, OR AS A GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER, BUT THAT WE WERE FAITHFUL AND RUNNING OUR CAMPAIGN, THAT WE DID IT, YOU KNOW, TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES, BUT DID IT WITH GOOD CHARACTER AND NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT. AND TO BE PROUD OF WHAT WE DID. (music)[APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] JANET HUCKABEE: YOU DO KNOW I AM NOT THE MAIN EVENT, DON'T YOU? THANK YOU SO MUCH. IMAGINE YOURSELF AT A DINNER, AND YOUR DINNER GUESTS WERE GEORGE WASHINGTON, JOHN ADAMS, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, AND THOMAS JEFFERSON. AND YOU HAD 30 MINUTES TO DEFEND AMERICA. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO DEFEND AMERICA? WOULD YOU SAY THAT AMERICA IS GREAT? WOULD YOU SAY THE ECONOMY IS SOARING? WOULD YOU SAY OUR VALUE SYSTEM IS SOLID? OR WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS BEING TRAMPLED? THERE IS FIGHTING IN THE STREETS, CONGRESS IS DOING NOTHING. THE UNBORN IS NOT PROTECTED. AND THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP IN THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] WHERE IS THE PASSION THAT THOSE FOREFATHERS HAD? WHEN THEY LEFT THE COUNTRY TO COME AND START AMERICA. DO WE HAVE PASSIONS THE TODAY THAT THEY HAD? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD DIE FOR THAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN FIGHT TODAY FOR EVERYDAY WHEN THEY GO FIGHT? DO WE STILL HAVE THAT PASSION? AMERICA IS A GREAT STORY, BUT I THINK IT CAN BE GREATER. MIKE AND I STARTED OUR STORY RIGHT HERE IN HOPE, ARKANSAS. I MOVED HERE WHEN I WAS ONE AND A HALF. MY MOM HAD FIVE KIDS. IN SEVEN YEARS. THEY ARE ALL HERE TODAY. I AM VERY GRATEFUL. [APPLAUSE] PERHAPS SHE NEEDED CABLE TV, I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE HAD FIVE KIDS IN SEVEN YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY, SHE HAD THE RAISE THOSE KIDS WITHOUT GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE BY HERSELF. BUT MIKE AND I WERE EDUCATED HERE IN HOPE, ARKANSAS. AND ON GENERALLY 29, 1973, I HAD MY FIRST DATE. HE HAD TO WAIT FOR MY BASKETBALL GAME TO GET FINISHED. [LAUGHTER] AND HE HAD TO WAIT FOR ME TO CLEAN UP AND SHOWER. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, ALL OF THE RESTAURANTS IN HOPE, ARKANSAS WERE CLOSED. AND WE HAD TO TRAVEL TO FULTON, ARKANSAS, WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER, TO A 24-HOUR TRUCKSTOP. [LAUGHTER] I MIGHT ADD, IT WAS VERY QUIET AND ROMANTIC. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT WAS PERFECT FOR ME. AND THAT FOLLOWING YEAR, WE GOT MARRIED. AS YOU SAW IN THE VIDEO, THAT WAS 41 YEARS AGO. BUT I'M GOING FOR THE GOLD. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IN NINE YEARS, THAT COULD BE 50. I AM NOT TOO FAR OFF. WITH MY HISTORY OF CANCER, I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T MAKE IT TO 20, SO I REALLY EXCITED NOW THAT I MIGHT MAKE A 50 YEAR ANNIVERSARY. YOU SEE, WE HAVE LIVED THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND EVERYBODY OUGHT TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. BUT WITH THAT BATTLE OF CANCER, AND LATER WHEN WE HEARD WE MAY NOT HAVE CHILDREN, I FOUND OUT RIGHT AWAY I WAS PREGNANT WITH OUR FIRST SON. AND MIKE AND I DECIDED RIGHT AWAY THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM. [INDISCERNIBLE] HE HAD TO SELL THOSE GUITARS. AND HE MADE A SACRIFICE FOR US. AND WE HAD A WASHER AND DRYER. SEE, THAT IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT RIGHT AWAY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT, YOU FIND A WAY TO DO IT. AND YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY. I HAVE THREE WONDERFUL CHILDREN. SOON TO HAVE FIVE GRANDCHILDREN THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF. HE TOOK CARE OF THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY TIME MAGAZINE NAMED HIM ONE OF THE BEST GOVERNORS IN ERICAM [APPLAUSE] AMERICA IS A GREAT COUNTRY. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IT GREATER. WHAT STORY ARE WE GOING TO TELL? THAT WE GAVE UP? OR THAT WE FOUGHT WITH GREAT PASSION LIKE OUR FOREFATHERS DID? THAT IS IMPORTANT. THAT IS THE STORY WE HAVE TO TELL. OUR PRESIDENT PROMISED AMERICANS HOPE. OUR NEXT PRESIDENT SHOULD GIVE EVERY AMERICAN AND TAKE THEM FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS. [APPLAUSE] I LOVE YOU. (music) (music) >> GOVERNOR HUCKABEE'S DOOR WAS NAILED SHUT. IT WAS IN BILL CLINTON'S ARKANSAS. HE HAD HUGE MAJORITIES, ALL THE APPARATUS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALIGNED AGAINST MIKE. THIS REPUBLICAN COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND WINS. EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE AND POLITICS WAS A FIGHT. SOMETIMES IT WAS AN INTENSE ONE. ANY REDNECK CAN START A FIGHT. A LEADER ONLY STARTS A FIGHT HE IS PREPARED TO FINISH. AS GOVERNOR AS ARKANSAS I CUT TAXES AND WELFARE, AND RAISED FAMILY INCOME BY 50%. WE EMPOWERED PEOPLE TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE. I'M NOT A REPUBLICAN BECAUSE I GREW UP RICH. I'M A REPUBLICAN BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE POOR WAITING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RESCUE ME. >> ONE THING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN AMERICA IS MOVING THE POWER AWAY FROM WASHINGTON WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO DISCONNECTED FROM THE WAY THAT SO MANY ORDINARY AMERICANS LIVE. IT IS A DISASTER. POWER NEEDS TO BE LOCAL AND LIMITED. THE CLOSER GOVERNMENT IS TO THE PEOPLE, THE MORE ACCOUNTABLE IT IS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING GOVERNED. INSTEAD OF MINIMUM WAGE, I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS OR EVERY AMERICAN TO EARN HIS OR HER MAXIMUM WAGE. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. WASHINGTON HAS DONE ENOUGH LIGHTING AND STEALING. I WILL NEVER ROB SENIORS OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED. I WILL LEAD WITH MORAL CLARITY IN A DANGEROUS WORLD. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG, GOOD AND EVIL. I WILL KEEP ALL OF THE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE EVIL FORCES OF RADICAL ISLAM. WE BELIEVE IN THINGS, WE STAND BY THOSE THINGS, WE LIVE OR DIE BY THOSE THINGS. LET'S WIN THE FIGHT FOR WHAT MATTERS MOST. [APPLAUSE] [COUNTRY MUSIC] ANNOUNCER: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME NATIVE SON OF HOPE, ARKANSAS, GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [CHANTING] MIKE HUCKABEE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOW. FOLKS, IT IS A LITTLE BRICK RED HOUSE ON A 2ND STREET IN HOPE ARKANSAS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] BUT HERE IN THIS SMALL TOWN CALLED HOPE, I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT WHERE A PERSON STARTED DIDN'T MEAN THAT IS WHERE HE HAD TO STOP. [APPLAUSE] I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT I KID CAN GO FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. AND LIKE A LOT OF AMERICANS, I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN THAT WAS FAR REMOVED FROM THE POWER, MONEY, AND INFLUENCE THAT RUNS THIS COUNTRY. BUT POWER, MONEY, AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE HAD LEFT A LOT OF AMERICANS LAGGING BEHIND. THEY WORK HARD, THEY LIFT HEAVY THINGS, AND THEY SWEAT THROUGH THEIR CLOTHES, BUT THEY CAN'T SEEM TO GET AHEAD OR STAY EVEN. MY PARENTS WERE LIKE THAT. MY DAD WAS NOT AN EDUCATED MAN, BUT HE WAS A SMART MAN. THEY DID NOT HAVE A WHOLE LOT, BUT THEY HAD HONESTY TO THE BONE. WE WERE TOLD TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS WE WOULD HAVE OTHERS DO UNTO US. [APPLAUSE] IT WAS HERE IN HOPE THAT I BONE. WE WERE TOLD TO DO UNTO OTHERS LEARNED TO READ, TO RIDE A BIKE, TO SWIM, AND TO PLAY FAIR. I LEARNED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG, AND I LEARNED THAT GOD LOVES ME AS MUCH AS ANYONE, BUT THAT HE DOESN'T LOVE SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I LEARNED ABOUT AMERICA. IN THIS KINDERGARTEN, AS WELL AS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, I LEARNED THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, THE LORD'S PRAYER, AND THE PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE PRAY AT THE START OF EACH DAY, AND WE PRAYED AGAIN FOR LUNCH. I LEARNED THAT THIS EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY COULD ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE PROVIDENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: IT WAS HERE IN HOPE THAT I LEARNED HOW TO HANDLE A FIREARM AND A FISHING POLE. I SPENT A LOT OF HOURS WITH BOTH. I GOT MY FIRST BB GUN AT AGE FIVE. IT WAS A DAISY MODEL 25. I STILL HAVE IT. IT IS IN MINT CONDITION. I LEARNED THE BASIC RULES OF GUN SAFETY, AND I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT USING A FIREARM TO MURDER SOMEONE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I RAN LINES ALL NIGHT SO THAT WE COULD CATCH CATFISH THAT WE WOULD FREEZE AND LIVE OFF OF FOR WEEKS. IT WAS HERE THAT I WAS BAPTIZED IN THE GARRET MEMORIAL BAPTIST CHURCH WHEN I WAS JUST 10 YEARS OLD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I TRULY WENT FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. IT WAS HERE THAT I MET THE GIRL THAT WOULD BECOME MY WIFE OF 40 YEARS AND GIVE ME THREE CHILDREN AND SHARE WHAT WILL SOON BE FIVE GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE KNEW EACH OTHER FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND WE STARTED DATING OUR SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS ALSO HERE THAT I GOT A JOB AT KXIR RADIO AT AGE 14. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT THE JOB WOULD NOT ONLY PAY MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL, BUT ALSO GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE MENTORED BY THE STATION MANAGER AND ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICANS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTY. [LAUGHTER] MIKE HUCKABEE: IT WAS HERE THAT I BECAME THE FIRST MALE IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY LINEAGE TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AT THE VERY SAME CAMPUS THAT STANDS TODAY ON MAIN STREET. AND IT WAS HERE THAT I WENT TO WASHITA BAPTIST UNIVERSITY. I ALSO RAN FOR OFFICE AT HOPE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: IT SEEMS PERFECTLY FITTING THAT IT WOULD BE HERE THAT I ANNOUNCE THAT I AM A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] [AUDIENCE CHANTING] MIKE HUCKABEE: THANK YOU. I AM GLAD YOU REACTED THAT WAY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY LONELY DAY IF YOU HAVE BEEN QUIET. IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT I YOUNG, UNTESTED, INEXPERIENCED, AND VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN FRESHMAN A SENATOR MADE GREAT SPEECHES ABOUT HOPE AND CHANGE. BUT EIGHT YEARS LATER, ARE GET MORE THAN DOUBLED, -- OUR DEBTS MORE THAN DOUBLED, OUR LEADERSHIP HAS COMPLETELY EVAPORATED, IN THE COUNTRY IS MORE POLARIZED THAN EVER IN MY LIFETIME. 93 MILLION AMERICANS DON'T HAVE JOBS AND MANY OF THEM WHO DO HAVE SEEN THEIR FULL-TIME JOB WITH BENEFITS THEY ONCE HAD BECOME TWO PART-TIME JOB WITH NO BENEFITS AT ALL. WE WERE PROMISED HOPE, BUT IT WAS JUST TALK. AND NOW WE NEED THE KIND OF CHANGE THAT REALLY COULD GET AMERICA FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: VETERANS WHO KEPT THEIR PROMISE TO AMERICA, WHO HAVE KEPT US FREE, NOW WAIT FOR MONTHS FOR OUR COUNTRIES PROMISE FOR THE SCARS FROM THE VERY WARS THAT WE SENT THEM TO FIGHT. [APPLAUSE] OUR VETERANS SHOULD BE GETTING THE FIRST SERVING FROM OUR TREASURY, NOT THE LEFTOVERS. MY FRIENDS, WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, OUR VETERANS ARE NOT GOING TO BE LEFT ON THE STREETS AND WAITING ROOMS TO ROT, BUT THEY WILL BE TREATED WITH THE DIGNITY THEY HAVE EARNED AND DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WHEN I MEET MEN WHO HAVE AN AMERICAN LEGION CAP OR ONE THAT SAYS ""VETERAN"" I NEVER TRY AND FAIL TO SAY THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME MY FREEDOM. WE OWE THEM MORE THAN A PAT ON THE BACK. WE NEED TO TAKE THEM FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] WASHINGTON IS MORE DYSFUNCTIONAL THAN EVER, AND HE DOES BECOME SO BOLD TO THE DONOR CLASS WHO HAS FILLED THE CAMPAIGN COFFERS, THAT IT IGNORES THE FACT THAT 1 IN 4 AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE PAYING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME JUST FOR HOUSING. HOME OWNERSHIP HAS THE LOWEST LEVEL IN DECADES. A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH HEAVY STUDENT DEBT ARE LIKELY TO AFFORD THEIR FIRST HOME FOR A LONG WHILE. OUR FEDERAL POLICIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AREN'T DESIGNED TO PROTECT FAMILIES, BUT RATHER TO PROTECT BUREAUCRATS. WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENROLLED IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS LIKE FOOD STAMPS, AND IT IS NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO BE IN POVERTY. IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THE BOTTOM 90% OF WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY WHOSE WAGES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT FOR THE PAST TWO 40 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THE WAR ON POVERTY HASN'T ENDED POVERTY, IT HAS PROLONGED IT. I DON'T JUDGE SUCCESS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF GOVERNMENT. I JUDGE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD JOBS AND DON'T NEED GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND WE DON'T CREATE GOOD JOBS FOR AMERICAN BY S BY ENTERING INTO UNBALANCED TRADE DEALS THAT FORGO CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY AND THEN LOOK OVER THE LOSS OF THAT WE CAN IMPORT LOW-WAGE LABOR, UNDERCUT AMERICAN WORKERS, AND DRIVER WAGES LOWER THAN THE DEAD SEA. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO, I COVERED IN A STATE THAT WAS THE MOST LOPSIDED AND PARTISAN IN THE COUNTRY. NO REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR HAD MORE DEMOCRATS. I CHALLENGE THE POLITICALLY ENTRENCHED MACHINE THAT RAN THIS STATE. IT WAS TOUGH SLEDDING, BUT I LEARNED HOW TO GOVERN, AND I LEARNED HOW TO LEAD. EVEN IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, WE PASSED 94 TAX CUTS, REBUILT OUR ROAD SYSTEM, SAW DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT TEXT SCORES, AND FOUGHT SO THAT WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE WOULD BE GIVEN A FAIR SHAKE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE SAW FAMILY INCOME INCREASED BY 50% DURING MY TENURE. THERE ARE SOME WHO PROPOSE THAT TO SAVE THE SAFETY NETS LIKE MEDICARE AND SECURITY, WE OUGHT TO CHOP OFF THE PAYMENTS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SAFELY HAVE THEIR PAYCHECKS WAITING FOR THEM WHEN THEY ARE OLD AND SICK. MY FRIEND, YOU ARE FORCED TO PAY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE FOR 50 YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT GRABS THE MONEY FROM OUR PAYCHECKS AND SAYS IT WILL BE WAITING FOR US WHEN WE TURN 65. IF CONGRESS WANTS TO TAKE AWAY SOMEONE'S RETIREMENT, LET THEM TAKE THEIR OWN CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS, NOT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. BECAUSE HOW CAN ANYONE EVER TRUST GOVERNMENT AGAIN, IF THEY STEAL FROM US AND LIE TO US? IT DIDN'T HELP WHEN CONGRESS TOOK $700 BILLION OUT OF MEDICARE TO PAY FOR OBAMACARE. AND INSTEAD OF HELPING FAMILIES FIND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, WE CREATED A MONSTER THAT FORCES US TO BUY COVERAGE THAT WE DON'T WANT, DON'T NEED, AND CAN'T AFFORD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND IMAGINE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BOASTING THEY WILL FIGHT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, AND THEN TURNING AROUND AND SIGNING UP FOR IT. REAL HEALTH CARE REFORM IS GOING TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND TOURS CURES RATHER THAN COSTLY INTERVENTION. BECAUSE HOPE COMES FROM FINDING CURES FOR CANCER, DIABETES, ALZHEIMER'S, THE SAME WAY THAT WE ONCE LINED UP AT THE COURTHOUSE IN THE 1950S AND TOOK OUR VACCINES TO ERADICATE POLIO. REAL CURES CAN GIVE HOPE TO FAMILIES WHO HEAR A DREADED DIAGNOSIS AND ARE SENTENCED TO A SLOW AND AGONIZING DEATH. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ALONE WILL COST WELL OVER $1 TRILLION BY THE YEAR 2050. FOCUSING ON CURES INSTEAD OF TREATMENTS SAVES MONEY, LIVES, AND FAMILIES. I REMEMBER PRESIDENT KENNEDY TELLING US THAT WE WOULD SEND A MAN TO THE MOON AND BRING HIM HOME IN A DECADE. PRESIDENT KENNEDY DID NOT LIVE TO SEE THAT COME TRUE, BUT I DID. AND IT MADE ME BELIEVE THAT AMERICA COULD DO ANYTHING IT SET ITS MIND TO. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND AS PRESIDENT, AS PRESIDENT I WOULD LAUNCH A CURATIVE APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE, SAVE MONEY AND LIVES, NOT JUST A BUNCH OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE FACE REAL THREATS FROM RADICAL JIHADISM IN THE FORM OF GROUPS LIKE ISIS AN D STATE TERRORISTD LIKE IRAN. BUT WE PUT MORE PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO BUILDING BEDROOMS FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN JUDEA THEN WE PUT ON IRAN FOR BUILDING A BOMB. DEALING WITH RADICALS WHO CHANT ""DEATH TO AMERICA"" AND FUND ROCKETS TO MURDER CIVILIANS IN ISRAEL IS NONSENSE. WHEN I HEAR MY PRESIDENT SAY HE WANTS CHRISTIANS TO GET OFF THEIR HIGH HORSE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE NICE WITH RADICAL JIHADISTS, I WONDER. [BOOING] MIKE HUCKABEE: I WONDER IF YOU COULD WATCH A WESTERN FROM THE 50'S AND FIGURE OUT WHO THE GOOD GUYS AND BAD GUYS REALLY ARE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL NO LONGER MERELY TRY TO CONTAIN JIHADISM, WE WILL CONQUER IT. [CHEERING] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE WILL DEAL WITH JIHADIS JUST THE WAY WE WOULD DEAL WITH DEADLY SNAKES. LET THERE BE NO DOUBT, ISRAEL WILL KNOW, AS WILL BE WHOLE WORLD, THAT WE ARE THEIR TRUSTED FRIEND AND THE AYATOLLAHS OF IRAN WILL KNOW THAT HELL WILL FREEZE OVER BEFORE THEY GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. [CHEERING] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND I COMMIT THIS TO YOU TODAY -- I WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA, EVER. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE FACE NOT ONLY THE THREATS FROM TERRORISM, BUT ALSO THE THREAT OF NEW KINDS OF DANGERS. FROM A CYBER WAR THAT COULD SHUT DOWN MAJOR FINANCIAL MARKETS, TO THREATS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE FROM AN EXPLODED DEVICE THAT COULD FRY THE ELECTRICAL GRID AND TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK TO THE STONE AGE IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. WAITING UNTIL IT HAPPENS IS TOO LATE. BUT WE HAVE LOST OUR WAY MORALLY. WE HAVE WITNESSED THE SLAUGHTER OF OVER 55 MILLION BABIES IN THE NAME OF CHOICE, AND WE ARE NOW THREATENING THE FOUNDATION OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BY CRIMINALIZING CHRISTIANITY AND ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD ABANDON BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: MANY OF OUR POLITICIANS HAVE SURRENDERED TO THE FALSE GOD OF JUDICIAL SUPREMACY, WHICH WOULD ALLOW UNELECTED JUDGES TO MAKE LAWS AS WELL AS ENFORCE IT, UPENDING THE BALANCE OF POWERS SO ESSENTIAL TO THE CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT THE SUPREME BEING. AND THEY CANNOT OVERTURN THE LAWS OF NATURE OR OF NATURE'S GOD. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON IS DYSFUNCTIONAL BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME THE ROACH MOTEL. PEOPLE COME IN, BUT THEY NEVER COME OUT. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT FOR TERM LIMITS ON ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. THAT WOULD HELP RETURN US TO THE FOUNDER'S DREAM SERVING THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE A TEMPORARY DUTY, NOT A LUCRATIVE CAREER WITH GENEROUS PENSIONS AND PACKCHECKS. IF SOMEONE IS ELECTED TO AN OFFICE, THEN GIVE THE TAXPAYERS WHAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR AND THE JOB THAT YOU SAID YOU WANTED. IF YOU LIVE OFF THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL AND WANT TO RUN FOR AN OFFICE OF THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO, THEN AT LEAST HAVE THE INTEGRITY AND DECENCY TO RESIGN ONE THAT YOU DON'T WANT ANYMORE AND PURSUE THE ONE YOU'D RATHER HAVE. [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY THE 10TH AMENDED. I WOULD ACTUALLY ABIDE BY IT. THIS POWER IS NEVER INTENDED TO BE SO CONCENTRATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. OUR CONSTITUTION IS EXPLICITLY CLEAR ABOUT KEEPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SMALL, SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON SIMPLE THINGS LIKE PROVIDING A MILITARY AND SECURING OUR BORDERS. THERE ARE THINGS BEING DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT SHOULD BE DONE AT THE STATE, OR EVEN BETTER, THE FAMILIES. WHY EVEN HAVE A FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION? IT FLUNKED, AND IT NEEDS TO BE EXPELLED. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: EDUCATION POLICY OUGHT TO BE SET BY STATE, LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS, AND BEST OF ALL, BY THE MOMS AND DADS OF THE CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND COMMON SENSE TELLS US THE BEST GOVERNMENT IS THE MOST LOCAL AND MOST LIMITED. WE SUPERSIZED THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY, BUT WE HAVEN'T DOWNSIZED THE MILITARY AND LEFT OUR BORDERS OPENED AN UNCONTROLLED. YES, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE IMMIGRATION ISSUES, BUT NOT WITH AMNESTY. WE NEED TO START TAKING CONTROL OF OUR OWN BORDERS. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: BUT AS AMERICANS, WE OUGHT TO GET ON OUR KNEES EVERY NIGHT AND THANK GOD WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BREAK INTO RATHER THAN BREAK OUT OF. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING A SPEECH AND MAKING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. YOU CAN'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. YOU CAN'T BORROW MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY BACK. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO LIVE BY THE RULES THAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE BY. AND THEY SHOULD FUNCTION UNDER A BALANCED BUDGET, JUST LIKE EVERY YEAR I WAS A GOVERNOR. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I DON'T WANT TO HEAR POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT TINKERING WITH THE TAX CODES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS THAT STILL LET POWERFUL WASHINGTON INTERESTS PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. WE CAN NEVER CREATE PROSPERITY FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE, NEVER GROW OUR ECONOMY OUT OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT OF DEBT, NEVER BRING AMERICA BACK TO THE GREATEST ECONOMY ON EARTH IF WE CONTINUE TO PUNISH PRODUCTIVELY AND SUBSIDIZE RECKLESS IRRESPONSIBILITY. [APPLAUSE] THERE WAS A MAN I MET AT A MACHINE SHOP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE TOLD ME THAT HE STARTED WORKING A DOUBLE SHIFT TO HELP HIS DAUGHTER PAY FOR GRAD SCHOOL. HE FIGURED THAT IF HE WORKED 16 HOURS RATHER THAN EIGHT, HE WOULD BRING HOME TWICE THE PAY. BUT HE FOUND OUT THAT THE MONEY HE WORKED FOR ON THAT SECOND SHIFT HIM IN A NEW TAX BRACKET AND THE GOVERNMENT GOT MORE OF IT THAN HE DID. IT IS NOT THAT OUR TAX SYSTEM IS PUNISHING THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA, THEY CAN AFFORD ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS WHO FIND A WAY TO PROTECT THEM. IT IS THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR WAGES WHO CAN'T GET AHEAD IF THE GOVERNMENT PENALIZES THEM FOR TRYING TO DO BETTER. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AS PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK TO PASS THE FAIR TAX WHICH WOULD NO LONGER PENALIZE PEOPLE'S WORK. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: WE WOULDN'T PENALIZE PEOPLE'S WORK OR INVESTMENTS OR GOOD STEWARDSHIP. IT WOULD END BIG GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WOULD FINALLY RID OURSELVES OF THE BIGGEST BULLY IN AMERICA -- THE IRS. [CHEERING] THE IRS WOULD DISAPPEAR, AND APRIL 15 WOULD JUST BE ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL SPRING DAY. THE STRUGGLE FOR MANY FAMILIES FIGHTING WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE OUGHT TO BE. A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. WE NEED TO BE PROMOTING THE MAXIMUM WAGE, WITH A WORKER AVAILING HIMSELF TO A JOB THAT PAYS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT. ONLY BY EMPOWERING THOSE TO REACH THEIR MAXIMUM WAGE CAN WE TAKE PEOPLE FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] THIS COUNTRY HAS GOT THREE THINGS TO STAY FREE. FEED ITSELF, FUEL ITSELF, AND FIGHT FOR ITSELF. WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP OUR FARMERS FROM BEING REGULATED OUT OF BUSINESS. WE HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY RESOURCES UNDER OUR OWN FEET. IF WE COULD BRING AFFORDABLE ENERGY TO AMERICA BECOME THE LARGEST EXPORTER SO THAT AMERICANS PROSPER IN DEVELOPING THE ENERGY, AND WE AREN'T IMPOVERISHED ANYMORE BY PAYING FOR IT WHEN IT IS REDUCED BY SOME SAUDI SHEIK OR SOME RUSSIAN ROBBER BARON. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR OURSELVES BY BRINGING MANUFACTURING TO OUR OWN COMMUNITIES. THE JOURNEY THAT BEGINS IN HOPE TODAY CAN LEAD THIS NATION TO HIGHER GROUND. BUT I CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT PEOPLE BEING MY PARTNERS. MANY WHO WERE NEVER INVOLVED IN POLITICS UNTIL NOW. I WILL LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET. I HAVE NEVER HAD BEEN AND WILL NEVER BE THE FAVORITE CANDIDATE OF THOSE IN THE WASHINGTON TO WALL STREET CORRIDOR OF POWER. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I WILL BE FUNDED AND FUELED NOT BY THE BILLIONAIRES, BUT BY WORKING PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA, THAT WILL FIND OUT THAT $15 AND $20 A MONTH CONTRIBUTIONS CAN TAKE US FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: REST ASSURED, IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS, PLEASE DO IT. [LAUGHTER] BUT I KNOW MOST OF YOU CAN'T. I'M JUST GOING TO ASK YOU TO GIVE SOMETHING. IN THE NAME OF YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. I WALKED AWAY FROM IMY OWN INCOME TO DO THIS, SO I AM NOT ASKING FOR SOME SACRIFICE I AM UNWILLING TO MAKE. I DON'T HAVE A GLOBAL FOUNDATION OR A TAXPAYER-FUNDED PAYCHECK TO LIVE OFF OF. I DON'T COME FROM A FAMILY DYNASTY, BUT A WORKING FAMILY. INCOME TO DO THIS, SO I AM NOT I GREW UP BLUE-COLLAR, NOT BLUE BLOOD. I ASK YOU TO JOIN WITH ME TODAY NOT JUST SO I CAN BE PRESIDENT, BUT SO WE CAN PRESERVE THIS GREAT REPUBLIC AND SOMEDAY SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN CAN STILL GO FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I STILL REMEMBER WHEN MY DAD TOOK ME TO THE DEDICATION OF THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED ARK, NAME FOR MY BEST FRIEND LESTER WHO IS HERE TODAY. I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD, AND MY DAD SAID, SON, GOVERNORS DON'T COME DEDICATE THIS LAKE. I WILL TAKE YOU DOWN THERE TO HEAR HIM TALK. BECAUSE YOU MAY LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE, AND YOU MAY NEVER GET MEET A GOVERNOR IN PERSON. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: HAD MY DAD LIVED JUST FOUR MONTHS LONGER, HE WOULD HAVE SEEN ME DO MORE THAN MEET A GOVERNOR, HE WOULD HAVE SEEN ME BECOME THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF MY STATE. [APPLAUSE] I ALWAYS WISH HE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE. SPEND ONE NIGHT IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. I ALWAYS WANTED TO FEEL HE DID SEE THAT MOMENT FROM THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE. AND I HOPE HE IS ABLE TO WATCH IN JANUARY 27 TEEN WHEN THAT KID IS SWORN IN AS THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.. AND WITH YOUR HELP AND GOD, WE WILL MAKE THAT JOURNEY FROM HOPE TO HIGHER GROUND. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] (music) >>",2015-11-07 17:42:27,2015-04-21,Concord,New Hampshire

YOU MIGHT FIDNND SOME WHITNEY PRODUCTS. THERE ARE 40 OF US EMPLOYEES, AND WE ARE EXCITED TO HAVE THE SECRETARY HERE, AND I THINK THE PROCESS WILL BE IS THAT BRIEFLY MY COWORKERS WILL IDENTIFY THEMSELVES, SAY ONE OR TWO SENTENCES ABOUT WHAT THEY DO HERE, COME IN THE YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN HERE AT WHITNEY, WHERE THEY LIVE, AND THEN I THINK WE WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION AND THE SECRETARY WILL SPEAK TO US. THANKS. SO I WILL START OFF. I AM DAVE STABLER. I HAVE BEEN AT WHITNEY FOR 32 YEARS, PROBABLY LONGER BECAUSE I WORKED HERE AS A BOY DURING THE SUMMERS. AND I DID NOT LIKE IT MUCH WHEN I WAS HERE. SO I LEFT KEENE IN MY 20'S AND CAME BACK IN MY 30'S WHEN I REALIZED THAT KEENE WAS A GREAT PLACE TO RAISE A FAMILY. AND THAT MADE IT WORTHWHILE, AND THE BUSINESS WAS A GROWING BUSINESS, AND THAT MADE IT EXCITING. I LIVE IN KEENE. I HAVE THREE SONS. AND THAT IS REALLY ABOUT IT. BILLY, DO YOU WANT TO START US OFF?

I LIVE IN FITZWILLIAM, AND I HAVE TWO GROWN CHILDREN, A BOY AND A GIRL AND A NEW GRANDDAUGHTER. SECRETARY CLINTON: WELL, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME AND GIVING ME A CHANCE NOT ONLY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS BUSINESS, WHICH IS A FAMILY BUSINESS, 112 YEARS YOUNG, AND TO MEET SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE, AS I DID WHEN I WAS WALKING THROUGH AND AS YOU JUST INTRODUCED YOURSELVES. I AM EXCITED TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A SMALL BUSINESS UP AND GOING AND KEEP IT GROWING IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. SMALL BUSINESS IS THE BACKBONE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, 96% OF ALL BUSINESSES ARE CONSIDERED SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THEY EMPLOY MORE THAN HALF OF THE WORKERS, THE EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT TAKES TO START AND GROW A SMALL BUSINESS. I COME FROM A SMALL BUSINESS FAMILY. MY FATHER HAD A VERY SMALL BUSINESS. HE PRINTED DRAPERY FABRIC. HE DID MUCH OF THE WORK HIMSELF, SOMETIMES WITH DAY LABORERS, WITH MY MOTHER, MY BROTHERS, AND ME, TAKING THE SQUEEGEE, YOU GO DOWN, YOU GO TO THE NEXT, AND YOU KEEP GOING. I SAW NOW THERE IS A MACHINE THAT YOU JUST DO THE PRINTING ON ALL KINDS OF MATERIAL, AND I'M THINKING BACK TO THOSE YEARS AT MY FATHER'S PLANT. HE MADE A VERY GOOD LIVING BECAUSE OF HIS HARD WORK AND HIS ABSOLUTE WILLINGNESS TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK TO DESIGN, TO PRODUCE, TO SELL THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE AT THE HEART OF WHAT HE PRODUCED. AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE GET SMALL BUSINESSES STARTING AND GROWING IN AMERICA AGAIN. WE HAVE STALLED OUT. I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT WHEN I BEGAN TO DIG INTO IT, BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE TELLING ME THIS AS I TRAVELED AROUND THE COUNTRY THE LAST TWO YEARS, BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE ARE NOT PRODUCING AS MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AS WE USED TO, AND A RECENT WORLD STUDY SAID THAT WE ARE 46TH IN THE WORLD IN THE DIFFICULTY TO START A SMALL BUSINESS. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES, AND WE WILL GET INTO SOME OF THOSE, I HOPE, TODAY. I WANT TO HEAR FROM EACH OF YOU, BECAUSE OF WHAT I AM DOING IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS MAKING MY OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. I WANT TO EMBED WHAT I PROPOSE AS POLICIES, NOT IN IDEOLOGY, NOT IN SOME PHILOSOPHY, BUT IN THE REAL DAILY LIVES AND EXPERIENCES OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS AND EVERYBODY WHO HAS A STAKE IN MAKING SURE THAT THE ECONOMY IS WORKING AGAIN. REALLY, WE HAVE TO DO MORE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT WITH STUDENT DEBT -- AND NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS THE HIGHEST STUDENT DEBT NUMBERS OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY -- THAT INTERFERES WITH YOUNG PEOPLE TAKING CERTAIN JOBS, BUYING A HOUSE, EVEN GETTING MARRIED, AND CERTAINLY STARTING A BUSINESS. WHEN I WAS IN IOWA LAST WEEKEND, I MET A YOUNG MAN, HIS DREAM HAD TO BEEN TO OWN THE BOWLING CENTER IS HOMETOWN. HE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE BECAUSE HE WORKED DURING THE SUMMERS AND HE WANTED TO OWN THAT BUSINESS, GOT A CHANCE TO DO IT, BUT WITH HIS STUDENT DEBT IT WAS REALLY A STRUGGLE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE, HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING WE EXPECT A YOUNG PERSON TO DO TO TRY TO BETTER THEMSELVES, HE WAS RUNNING INTO REAL CREDIT PROBLEM. EVEN NOW HE HAS GOT THE BUSINESS, BUT HE RUNS IT -- HE HAS A LITTLE GRILL AND RESTAURANT, HE WITH TWO EMPLOYEES ARE TRYING TO MAKE A GO OF IT. HERE IS A YOUNG, AMBITIOUS GUY, AND WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY DAD, IT WAS A LOT EASIER IN THOSE DAYS TO HAVE AN IDEA, WHAT YOU NEEDED, AND GO TO WORK. THAT PIECE OF THIS, AS WE WERE WALKING AROUND, AS DAVE WAS TELLING ABOUT ALL THE INCREDIBLE MACHINES THAT ARE USED HERE IN PRODUCTION, ALL BUT ONE ARE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. AND MANY OF THEM, IF I AM RIGHT, DAVE, ARE FROM EUROPE. DAVE: THAT IS CORRECT. SECRETARY CLINTON: EUROPE HAS HIGH WAGES, THEY HAVE HIGH COSTS. WHY ARE THEY PRODUCING THESE ADVANCED MACHINES INSTEAD OF US? WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE? YOU CAN SEE THAT MAYBE LOWER COST PLACES THAT ARE MASTERING THE ART OF MACHINE REDUCTION WOULD BE COMPETITIVE, THESE ARE HIGH-VALUE MACHINES, SOPHISTICATED MACHINES. HOW DO WE GET BACK INTO MORE BASIC PRODUCTION AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN RESUME OUR LEAD IN MANUFACTURING? SOMETHING THAT I CAN GET ESSENTIAL. A LOT OF PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH ME. THEY SAY THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT. YOU WALK AROUND HERE, YOU SEE THESE MACHINES FROM ITALY OR GERMANY OR WHEREVER ELSE THEY ARE FROM -- WHY AREN'T WE PRODUCING THESE MACHINES? WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO JUMP-START MANUFACTURING IN OUR COUNTRY? WE'VE GONE THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES, AND I THINK AMERICANS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF TO DO TO GET THROUGH THOSE TOUGH TIMES. BUT NOW IT IS NOT ENOUGH JUST TO TREAD WATER. WE NEED TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD, AND PEOPLE NEED TO FEEL THAT THEIR WORK IS BEING REWARDED THEM, THAT THE DECK IS NOT STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP, THAT THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO GO FAR WITH THEIR HARD WORK AND THEIR ASPIRATIONS WILL TAKE THEM. SO IN ORDER TO PUT TOGETHER A SET OF POLICIES FOR MY CAMPAIGN, I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN LINE WITH THE REAL LIVES AND REAL WORKING EXPERIENCES OF THE PEOPLE THAT I WOULD LOVE TO REPRESENT AS YOUR PRESIDENT. SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON FOUR BIG FIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT TO BUILD THE ECONOMY OF TOMORROW, NOT YESTERDAY, AND MAKE THE MIDDLE CLASS MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT TO HAVE STRONG FAMILIES AND STRONG COMMUNITIES, AND -- WHOSE CUSTOMER MARKET IS BETWEEN SIX MONTHS AND SIX YEARS. THAT IS RIGHT WHERE I AM FOCUSED THESE DAYS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A FUNCTIONING POLITICAL SYSTEM. I AM GOING TO FIGHT FOR THAT. I WILL WORK WITH ANYBODY. I HAVE DONE THAT. I DID IT AS SENATOR. I WILL DO IT AGAIN. BUT I WILL ALSO STAND MY GROUND IF I NEED TO. PART OF THAT IS GETTING UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS, BECAUSE WE CANNOT AFFORD THAT, EVEN IF IT TAKES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. AND THEN FINALLY, WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE VIGILANT TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AGAINST THE THREATS WE KNOW. WE CAN SEE THEM. BUT THEN THE THREATS WE CANNOT SEE, PANDEMIC DISEASES, CYBER WARFARE, ETC. SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. I'M THRILLED TO BE BACK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I SEE SOME OF MY FRIENDS OUT THERE IN THE AUDIENCE. THE FIRST PLACE I EVER CAME FOR ANY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN WAS IN 1991, WHEN I WAS HERE CAMPAIGNING FOR MY HUSBAND. IN OCTOBER OF 1991, CELEBRATED MY BIRTHDAY HERE IN KEENE, AND I HAVE A LOT OF WONDERFUL MEMORIES. SO WITH THAT, DAVE, I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO YOU AND WE CAN START HEARING FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS. DAVE: I WILL ASK THE INITIAL QUESTION, AND YOU GUYS CAN CHIME IN. EARLY CHILDHOOD IS OUR INTEREST, BUT WE ARE FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ELABORATE ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT DO FOR CHILDCARE IN THE FUTURE IF YOU ARE ELECTED. SECRETARY CLINTON: THAT IS A QUESTION NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BECAUSE I THINK EVERY SOCIETY STARTS WITH OUR YOUNGEST CITIZENS. AND WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, I WENT TO WORK WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. SO MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE, BOTH PROFESSIONALLY AND MY VOLUNTEER WORK, HAS BEEN AROUND CHILDREN AND FAMILIES, AND IT IS TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMITMENT WE CAN MAKE. AND NOW IT IS NOT ONLY THAT WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN, BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT THE WAY BRAINS DEVELOP, THANKS TO ALL THE GREAT RESEARCH THAT IS BEING DONE BY A -- OUR SCIENTISTS, THAT THOSE EARLY YEARS REALLY ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS THAT A CHILD WILL HAVE IN SCHOOL AND WHAT THAT CHILD CAN LEARN AND THEN WHAT THAT CHILD CAN CHOOSE TO DO, WHAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO START IN THE FAMILY. AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A PROJECT TO CONVINCE PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS, AUNTS, AND UNCLES, TO READ, TALK, AND SING TO THEIR BABIES, AND THAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN ANY CHILDCARE SETTING. SO WHEN YOU ARE PRODUCING FURNITURE THAT GIVE KIDS A CHANCE TO BE PART OF A CIRCLE, TO WORK ON A TABLE, ALL OF THAT, IT IS SAFETY AND STIMULATION ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT NEEDS THAT LITTLE, TINY BABIES HAVE. AND I THINK WE NEED A MUCH MORE BROADLY BASED UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM SO THAT KIDS HAVE A CHANCE TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL, AND I REALLY APPLAUD STATES -- AND THEY ARE NOT ALL THE STATES THAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF. OKLAHOMA HAS A UNIVERSAL PRE-K PROGRAM BECAUSE THEIR STATE DECIDED THEY WOULD INVEST IN THE EARLY YEARS TO GET THEIR KIDS BETTER FOR SCHOOL. AND I THINK THAT CHILDCARE PROBLEM -- I WAS LOOKING AT A STATISTIC THAT IT CAN COST AS MUCH AS $12,000 A YEAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR QUALITY CHILDCARE. THAT IS MORE THAN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COSTS, AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT? HOW CAN YOU EXPECT MOST FAMILIES TO AFFORD THAT KIND OF COST? SO WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT QUALITY CHILD CARE AND UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN BECAUSE BY THE TIME A CHILD ENTERS KINDERGARTEN, A LOT OF THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE, THEIR VOCABULARY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. SO IF WE WANT THEM TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL, AND I KNOW THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RETIRED TEACHERS OUT THERE, YOU WANT OUR KIDS TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL, IT HAS TO START IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS, AND THAT IS WHERE YOU COME IN. AND YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT A LIGHT TABLE AND OTHER THINGS THAT YOU PREPARED FOR SETTINGS WHERE LITTLE KIDS ARE -- THAT IS ALL TO STIMULATE THEM AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO DEVELOP THAT BRAIN AND LEARN MORE SO THEY ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR SCHOOL. DAVE: THANK YOU. GUYS, YOU WANT TO START OFF? ANYBODY? PAM: MY GRANDSON GOES TO THE HEAD START ACROSS THE WAY OVER THERE. IT IS FILLED WITH WHITNEY BROTHERS' PRODUCTS -- COAT LOCKERS, AND IN THERE ARE OUR LITTLE TABLES AND CHAIRS. IT MADE ME FEEL PROUD THAT I WORKED HERE THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE BUYING -- ALSO, THE GROWING DRUG PROBLEM IN THE AREA. WE ALSO NEED TO SEE MORE FOR IN OUR AREA. THERE ARE LIMITED RESOURCES. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING IN THAT RESPECT. DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER IDEAS? SECRETARY CLINTON: I DO, ACTUALLY. I AM REALLY CONCERNED BECAUSE, PAM, WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME, I'M HEARING FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THERE IS A HIDDEN EPIDEMIC. THE DRUG ABUSE PROBLEM, WHETHER PILLS OR METH OR HEROIN, IT IS NOT AS VISIBLE AS IT WAS 30 YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF GANGS AND VIOLENCE. THIS IS A QUIET EPIDEMIC. IT IS STRIKING IN SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL AREAS AS MUCH AS IT IS IN ANY BIG CITY. WE SEE STEADY CUTBACKS IN DRUG ABUSE PROGRAMS, TREATMENT PROGRAMS, MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. I SEE SENATOR KELLY HERE AND KNOW THE SENATOR HERE IS TRYING TO GET RESOURCES. WE HAVE A PERFECT STORM. WE HAVE AN INCREASING PROBLEM THAT IT IS ONLY BEGINNING TO BREAK THROUGH THE SURFACE SO THAT PEOPLE -- I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT IT IS SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM, NOT MY PROBLEM, AND INDEED IT IS ALL OUR PROBLEM. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES, SO THAT IF SOMEONE DECIDES THAT THEY WANT TO GET HELP, WHERE DO YOU SEND THEM? WHAT OF OPPORTUNITIES DO THEY HAVE FOR TREATMENT? I'M CONVINCED THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- BECAUSE I CONSIDER SUBSTANCE ABUSE PART OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- IT IS GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF MY CAMPAIGN BECAUSE INCREASINGLY IT IS A BIG ISSUE THAT PEOPLE RAISE WITH ME. AND WHEN I WAS IN IOWA LAST WEEK, I LITERALLY HEARD FROM ONE END OF THE STATE, FROM DAVENPORT TO COUNCIL BLUFFS, ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND HOW THE STATE WAS SHUTTING ALL THEIR IN-PATIENT FACILITIES AND THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR PEOPLE TO BE SENT. SO WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE. WE HAVE TREATMENT IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH IS A GOOD THING, AND WE HAVE IT, AT LEAST ON PAPER. IT'S CALLED IS MENTAL HEALTH PARITY, WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH LIKE PHYSICAL PROBLEMS. BUT WE ARE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS IS, AND THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES DO NOT END WITH THIS. YOU READ ABOUT A SMALL COUNTY IN SOUTHERN INDIANA WHERE THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF HIV AMONG THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY WERE SHARING NEEDLES AND SHOOTING UP SOME KIND OF PILL THAT WAS TURNED TO POWDER. SO NOW THEY HAVE NOT ONLY THE DRUG ABUSE PROBLEM, THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED HIV. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN JUST BRUSH UNDER THE RUG AND WISH IT WOULD GO AWAY. WE NEED A CONCERTED POLICY, NATIONAL, STATE, LOCAL, PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND WE NEED TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE THE MOTHER OF YOUR GRANDSON. PAM: THANK YOU. >> THE DRUG ISSUE IS NOT REALLY A NO-ISSUE EITHER. AS A KID MYSELF, AS THE SON OF A MINISTER, A PREACHER, THE LITTLE TOWN I GREW UP IN, I WAS THE ONLY ONE MY AGE WHO WAS NOT INVOLVED IN DRUGS OF SOME SORT. THE DEALER LIVED ACROSS THE STREET, THE KIDS USED DRUGS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR. AND THERE WAS REALLY NO RECOURSE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THIS LITTLE TOWN WAS 300,000 ACRES, A LOT OF TERRITORY TO COVER. IT WAS AN ONGOING ISSUE. SECRETARY CLINTON: THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. IT IS NOT A NEW ISSUE, BUT IT HAS TAKEN KIND OF A NEW TURN, IF YOU WILL. AND I THINK MORE YOUNG PEOPLE -- MAYBE BECAUSE WE STOPPED THE MESSAGING ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS DRUGS WERE, BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER THE SAME KIND OF MESSAGES ADVERTISING THAT WE WOULD ALL THE TIME, YOU DO NOT SEE THAT ANYMORE. I THINK FOR A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS PILLS, I THINK THEY BELEIVE, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT TAKING IT AND MIXING IT AND THE REST WILL BE DANGEROUS FOR THEM. THAT IS A GOOD POINT. DAVE: BILL? BILL: IN THE LINE WITH THE DRUG AND THINGS, YOU MADE A POINT OF EDUCATING KIDS AT AN EARLY AGE, IT MIGHT BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO MAYBE PUSH THE DRUG ISSUE THERE AT HEAD START, JUST IN A WAY THAT THEY WILL ALL UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT A GOOD AND TO DO, EVEN THOUGH YOUR FRIENDS MIGHT DO IT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS. SECRETARY CLINTON: SO STARTING EARLY. SO YOU HIRE A LOT OF PEOPLE. >> WHITNEY DOES DRUG TESTING, SO WE WANT A DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE. SECRETARY CLINTON: THAT SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE, AND A LOT OF EMPLOYERS ARE DOING THAT OR THINKING ABOUT THAT GOING BACK TO DOING THAT. IS THAT WE YOU HEAR FROM YOUR HUMAN RESOURCE CONTACTS AS WELL? >> YES. WORKMEN'S COMP LIKES HAVING IT, TOO, BECAUSE WE HAVE A MACHINE -- IF SOMEONE IS RUNNING THEM AND IS HIGH, SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT. SECRETARY CLINTON: JIM, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES? JIM, WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC ISSUES? JIM: MY KIDS ARE ALL GROWN AND THEY ARE IN THEIR LATE 20'S, SO THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES, SO I DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM ANYMORE THE WAY I USED TO WITH YOUNG KIDS. FOR MYSELF, I'M GETTING UP IN AGE -- AND I HAVE WORKED FOR A SMALL COMPANY ALL MY LIFE. AND MOST OF THEM HAVE JUST ENOUGH MONEY TO GIVE YOU MINIMAL HEALTH CARE, RETIREMENT. I HAVE VERY LITTLE SAVED FOR RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET WITH KIDS AND -- [INDISCERNIBLE] RESOURCES. THE COMPANY I JUST LEFT BEFORE I CAME HERE A YEAR AGO CLOSED THEIR DOORS BECAUSE THE ECONOMY. THEY WERE MAKING SUPER INSULATED PANELS FOR THE BUILDING, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE WAY TO GO. SO WHEN THEY CLOSED THE DOORS, THAT WAS 27 YEARS WORKING FOR THEM. IT LEFT ME LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB, AND THANKFULLY WHITNEY BROTHERS WERE LOOKING FOR MY SKILLS TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR PRODUCTS, AND I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR BEING HERE. BUT I LOOK AT YOUR IDEAS ON HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. AND WHERE ARE THOSE HEADING? I'M IN MY LATE 50'S RIGHT NOW, 10 YEARS FROM NOW I'M GOING TO HOPEFULLY WORK LESS. IN REGARDS TO OUR COMPANY HERE, WHAT CAN BE DONE TO BOLSTER OUR COMPANY TO HELP US LIVE A BETTER LIFE? SECRETARY CLINTON: IN YOUR 27 YEARS, WAS THERE ANY KIND OF RETIREMENT ACCOUNT, 401K, ANYTHING? JIM: THERE WAS INITIALLY, THAT LASTED UNTIL THE ECONOMY WENT BELLY UP BACK IN 2008. AND OUR COMPANY WENT RIGHT DOWN THE TUBES. PEOPLE WERE NOT GOING TO SPEND EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF MONEY TO GET A BETTER PRODUCT. THE SAME WHAT HAPPENS HERE. WE ARE STRUGGLING TO TRY TO FIGHT WITH THE CHINESE AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING SIMILAR ITEMS TO US AND ARE CUTTING COSTS, AND WE LOOK AT EVERY PENNY THAT WE PUT INTO OUR PRODUCTS HERE AND TRY TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF IT AS WE CAN WITH FANCY MACHINES, WITH PROCESSES THAT WE USE. SO, YEAH, THE COMPANY I WORKED FOR I THOUGHT WAS THE WAY TO GO. SECRETARY CLINTON: YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE ONE OF THE REALLY BIG PROBLEMS WE FACE IS THAT AMERICAN WORKER PRODUCTIVITY HAS CONTINUED TO GO UP. AMERICAN WORKERS WORK LONGER AND HARDER AND MORE PRODUCTIVELY THAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. BUT IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN THAT INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY INTO INCREASED WAGES. AND IN SOME CASES WHERE YOU HAVE SMALL COMPANIES, THE MARGIN IS TOO THIN. IT IS REALLY HARD TO DO THAT. IN SOME PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE BIG COMPANIES, THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. THEY WOULD RATHER DO STOCK BUYBACKS THAN INCREASE WAGES ADN SALARIES. SO I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A LOOK AT A RANGE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF COMPANIES BECAUSE SOME COMPANIES HAVE THE CASH AND MAKE DECISIONS THAT LEAVE OUT THEIR WORKERS, AND SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN AND THE WORK COMING AND BE SUCCESSFUL AND STAY AFLOAT. SO WHAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW WE INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE CASH TO DO MORE WITH IT AND HOW WE SUPPORT SMALLER BUSINESSES TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE TO GET MORE MARKET, ESPECIALLY EXPORT MARKET. DAVE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR SMALL BUSINESS IS TO HAVE ACCESS TO MARKET OPENINGS. HOW DO YOU GET THE BEST SUPPORT YOU NEED FOR A WEBSITE OR FOR TELLING OTHER POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT? HOW DO YOU COMPETE WITH, AS YOU SAY, SOMEBODY DOING THE SAME THING IN CHINA? SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS FROM KIND OF THE TOP AND THE MIDDLE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. ON SOCIAL SECURITY, THOUGH, THERE IS A LOT OF LOOSE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY. AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW PEOPLE CAN MAKE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THEY MAKE, BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW DEPENDENT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY, THEY WORKED HARD FOR IT, THEY RETIRE, THEY POSTPONE RETIREMENT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP WORKING, BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO GET THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PAYOUT FROM SOCIAL SECURITY. THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND, ACCORDING TO THE TRUSTEES, WILL BE SOLVENT UNTIL 2035. SO WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE IT IS THERE AND WE DO NOT MESS WITH IT AND WE DO NOT PRETEND THAT IT IS A LUXURY? BECAUSE IT IS NOT A LUXURY. IT IS A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO DRAW FROM SOCIAL SECURITY. SO I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME BIG POLITICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY. AND MY ONLY QUESTION TO EVERYBODY WHO THINKS WE CAN PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY OR UNDERMINE IT IN SOME WAY -- AND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO WORKED 27 YEARS AT THIS OTHER COMPANY? WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN? IT IS JUST WRONG. SO PART OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS SAY, EVERYBODY, TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS, AND HOW WE BUILD ON WHAT WORKS. AND LET'S NOT GET INTO ARGUMENTS, AS I SAY, ABOUT IDEOLOGY AND RHETORICAL ATTACKS AND CLAIMS. LET'S JUST KIND OF TAKE A DEEP BREATH HERE AS A COUNTRY AND SAY, OK, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE RETIREMENT ISSUES AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED HARD DESERVE TO HAVE ENOUGH SECURITY WHEN THEY RETIRE SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE. SO I AM 100% COMMITTED TO THAT. DAVE: THAT DOVETAILS TO WHAT MARY'S SITUATION -- I DO NOT KNOW YOUR WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT MARY WORKED HERE FOR A NUMBER YEARS, QUIT, THEN CAME BACK. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR DECISION? MARY: IT WAS A FINANCIAL SITUATION. AS A HOMEOWNER, THERE ARE ALWAYS REPAIRS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE, THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE, THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP THAT YOU DO NOT COUNT ON WHEN YOU'RE NOT WORKING. SO COMING BACK TO WORK, AND I SAID, WHY NOT COME BACK TO WHITNEY BROTHERS? IT IS A PLACE THAT I KNOW, I AM FAMILIAR WITH IT. I LIKE IT. I LIKE THE PRODUCT. SO FINANCIALLY. SECRETARY CLINTON: DID YOU THINK, MARY, WHEN YOU RETIRED THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HAD ENOUGH RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR NEEDS AND THEN SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENED? MARY: YEAH. I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE LIKE COMFORTABLE. NOT ABOVE, BUT COMFORTABLE. SECRETARY CLINTON: DID YOU START DRAWING SOCIAL SECURITY? MARY: YES. SECRETARY CLINTON: WHAT AMOUNT DID YOU GET? MARY: I ALSO HAVE A RETIREMENT, TOO, BUT I GOT $1400 A MONTH. SECRETARY CLINTON: SO I THINK IF YOU LOOK JUST REALISTIC, ESPECIALLY IF YOU STILL OWN YOUR HOME, YOU'RE STILL OBVIOUSLY INDEPENDENT AND ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF EXPENSES, BOTH PREDICTED AND UNPREDICTABLE. SO WHEN YOU CAME BACK, DID YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE HERE FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS, OR ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE IT YEAR BY YEAR? MARY: PART-TIME. GOING TO CATCH UP ON THOSE -- [INDISCERNIBLE] SECRETARY CLINTON: I CAN TELL. THEY WERE CALLING YOU EVERY DAY, SAYING, WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK? DAVE: THE EXPERIENCE BEING HERE SO MANY YEARS, IT IS TRULY PRICELESS. THAT IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR ADDRESS, AND THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE, MADAME SECRETARY, IS GETTING GOOD CNC ADULTS THAT ARE TRAINED IN MATH AND COMPUTERS -- WE COMPETE AGAINST AN LOT OF LOCAL COMPANIES THAT -- YOU LOOK AT OUR ADS IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, INTERNET, I MEAN, IT IS CNC FOLKS, PEOPLE THAT HAVE MATH SKILLS. OUR MACHINES ARE METRIC AND THE ARCHITECTS AND DEALERS ARE ASKING WHY ARE WE ARE SWITCHING. YOU NEED INTELLIGENT EMPLOYEES. YOU HAVE THE COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL DO TECHNICAL SERVICES, BUT IT JUST DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK. WE ARE ALWAYS STRUGGLING TO FIND PEOPLE LIKE THAT. WOULD YOU AGREE? >> YES, I WOULD AGREE. DAVE: I MEAN -- SECRETARY CLINTON: I MET A YOUNG MAN WHO WENT TO THE KEENE STATE COLLEGE PROGRAM TO LEARN THESE SKILLS, AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED MORE OF. WE NEED AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE LEVEL, COMMUNITY, FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE, WORK PROGRAMS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE SKILLS THAT EMPLOYERS ACTUALLY NEED. WHAT ARE THE JOB SKILLS THAT YOU ARE TRYING -- DAVE: IT'S TECHNICAL SKILLS. I THINK THERE IS A PLACE FOR THE HUMANITIES, BUT TECHNICAL SKILLS, ELECTRICIANS, PLUMBERS, THOSE ARE THE GUYS WE'RE LOOKING FOR, THOSE PEOPLE. SECRETARY CLINTON: WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO ENCOURAGING MORE YOUNG PEOPLE TO SEE THESE AS CAREERS, AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE BOTH MORE EDUCATION-BASED SKILLS PROGRAMS AND EMPLOYER-BASED SKILLS PROGRAMS, THE KIND OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND OTHER TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND TRY TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO MORE TO PUBLICIZE WHY THESE SKILLS ARE GOING TO GET YOU A GOOD JOB. I THINK WE HAVE KIND OF LOST THE THREAD HERE. TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW -- NOBODY TOLD THEM -- THAT YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD JOB, AS YOU JUST NAMED, AN ELECTRICIAN, WELDER, YOU NAME IT -- AND THE COMPUTERIZED NUMERICAL SYSTEM, THAT TAKES A YEAR OR TWO OF TRAINING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE THAT IS A LEVEL BEYOND WHAT WE TYPICALLY THINK OF AS TECHNICAL EDUCATION. SO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU AND MAYBE START WITH YOU, CHRIS, BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE COME FOR A JOB INTERVIEW, WHERE HAVE THEY GOTTEN THEIR SKILLS, OR DO THEY EVEN KNOW THAT THOSE SKILLS WOULD ENHANCE THEIR CHANCE TO GET HIRED? CHRIS: I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE COME HERE IS ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. THERE IS A CAREER CENTER AT THE HIGH SCHOOL, BUT IT IS MORE METAL THAN WOOD. IT CAN GO HAND IN HAND, BUT WITH US, WE LOOK MORE FOR WOOD AND IT IS MORE ON-THE-JOB TRAINING THE PEOPLE -- DAVE: SO WE ARE HAVING TO TRAIN RELATIVELY GREEN PEOPLE TO RUN THE MACHINES. AND IT HAS WORKED OUT, BUT, AGAIN, IN THE LOCAL MARKETPLACE, WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES THAT NEED CNC OPERATORS. WE MIGHT TRAIN SOMEONE FOR A YEAR OR TWO AND THEY MIGHT GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR A COUPLE OF DOLLARS MORE. THAT IS LIFE, THAT IS TOUGH, BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THERE COULD BE A GREATER POOL OF TECHNICALLY SKILLED PEOPLE. >> WE ARE DOING WITH MANUFACTURING AND WE ARE -- SO WE NEED TO GIVE OUR COSTS LOW, AND WE CAN ONLY PAY SO MUCH. SECRETARY CLINTON: YOU'VE GOT HAVE COST PRESSURES PLUS SKILLS PRESSURES. YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE PROGRAMS. WE'VE KIND OF BACKED OFF FROM WHAT USED TO BE CALLED TECHNICAL EDUCATION, AND I THINK THAT WE MADE A MISTAKE AS WE BACKED OFF THINKING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE PICKED UP BY EITHER BUSINESSES OR COMMUNITY COLLEGES, TECHNICAL SCHOOLS, AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN FAST ENOUGH. IT IS STARTING TO HAPPEN NOW. THERE ARE MORE PLACES WHERE YOU CAN GET THESE KIND OF TECHNICAL SKILLS, WE NEED TO CREATE A BIGGER POOL OF PEOPLE IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I VISITED A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN IOWA LAST YEAR THAT TAKES HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TRAINS THEM ON CNC. AND THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO REALLY BE JOB PREPARED WHEN THEY LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL. WHICH IS AMAZING. THEY MIGHT GRADUATE 30 OR 40 A YEAR, WHEN THE DEMAND IS MUCH GREATER THAN THAT. I REALLY APPROVE OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL TO TRY TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS FREE AS POSSIBLE. THAT WOULD BE A BIG HELP HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE IT IS SO COSTLY. THE AMOUNT OF TUITION IS SO HIGH, BOTH IN THE TWO-YEAR AND THE FOUR-YEAR SCHOOLS, BUT THAT STILL WILL NOT HELP UNLESS WE PROVIDE MORE INCENTIVES FOR THESE PEOPLE TO GO IN TRADE. JIM: IF I HAD TO SWITCH JOBS CAN FOR SOME REASON, THANK GOD I STILL HAVE DECENT SKILLS. AS A DRAFTER AND DESIGNER, I LEARNED HOW TO USE THE COMPUTER ON MY OWN WITHOUT ANY EDUCATION. IF I HAD MORE EDUCATION, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO MORE. BUT TO AFFORD TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL, TIMEWISE AS FAR AS COST, IT IS ALWAYS HARD. WITH HEALTH CARE AND ALL THAT, TAKING THE LITTLE BITS OUT OF MY PAY, THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR ME TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR ME TO GET OTHER NEW SKILLS, EITHER TO ENHANCE WHAT I AM DOING HERE OR TO THINK ABOUT IF I EVER DECIDED TO MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE. >> BEFORE I CAME TO WHITNEY BROTHERS I HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK INTO A CNC PROGRAM THAT IS OFFERED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE, BUT IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE IN CLAREMONT THAT NEXT SESSION, AND THAT WAS THE MIDDLE OF WINTER. BIT OF A HIKE UP THERE. FORTUNATELY, I FOUND THIS PLACE AND IT WORKED OUT VERY WELL. SECRETARY CLINTON: WHAT ARE YOUR HOURS OF OPERATION? DAVE: 7:00 TO 3:30, BUT IT GOES UNTIL 4:30, OR 5:00, SO EIGHT OR NINE HOURS. SOMETIMES IN THE SUMMER WE HAVE SECOND SHIFT, BECAUSE THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, THE BUSY MONTHS ARE JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. SECRETARY CLINTON: YOU HAVE THIS EQUIPMENT HERE, SO IF YOU GET SOME KIND OF GRANT OR OTHER SUPPORT FROM EITHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, STATE GOVERNMENT, EVEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR THE COLLEGES, AND YOU COULD HAVE A PROGRAM AT NIGHT. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO COME IN AND BASICALLY SAY WE ARE GOING TO DESIGNATE WHITNEY BROTHERS AS ONE OF OUR TRAINING FACILITIES, AND YOUR EXPERT EMPLOYEES WOULD GET SOME KIND OF WAGE BUMP BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE THE INSTRUCTORS. I JUST THINK WE GOT TO BE IMAGINING OUTSIDE THE OLD BOX ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO GET OUR SKILLS UP, HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET MORE PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THOSE SKILLS. VERY HARD TO DO IT IF YOU ARE ALREADY WORKING DURING THE WORKDAY, BUT MAYBE THERE COULD BE SOME COOPERATIVE APPROACH THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I HEAR WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH SKILLED WORKERS, WITH TECHNICAL SKILLS. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH R.N.'S AND CNA'S. WE HAVE A WHOLE MISSING GROUP OF EMPLOYEES THAT COULD BE EMPLOYED IN OUR INDUSTRIES, SO HOW DO WE FIX THAT? IF WE DO NOT FIX THAT, WE WILL NOT COMPETITIVE. WE WILL ALWAYS BE BEHIND THE CURVE. >> GOING BACK TO CHANGING THE MINDSET. WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND GROWING UP, THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING AN ELECTRICIAN OR PLUMBER OR CARPENTER. THESE WERE REALLY GOOD JOBS AND YOU COULD MAKE GOOD MONEY DOING THAT. AND IT SEEMED TO FALL OFF THE TABLE. EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO RIGHT TO THE TOP. NO, YOU GOT TO BE AT THE BOTTOM BEFORE YOU CAN WORK YOUR WAY IN THERE. AND I THINK IF WE WORK IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS, EVEN IN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS, AT SOME POINT, GET THESE KIDS -- A LOT OF KIDS JUST DO NOT WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY DO NOT WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE. FINE, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO COLLEGE TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING. BUT YOU HAVE TO GET IT OUT THERE, THAT IT IS OK NOT TO GO TO COLLEGE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO, BUT THESE ARE GOOD POSITIONS. YOU CAN GET A GOOD JOB, YOU CAN MAKE A GOOD LIVING, SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY BY DOING THESE OTHER THINGS. THAT KIND OF GOT OFF TRACK. SECRETARY CLINTON: I AGREE WITH YOU. THIS ANYBODY ELSE FEEL THAT WAY? >> WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE HAD A SEMESTER OF SHOP CLASSES. PAM: EVERYTHING GOT COMPUTERIZED AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO DESIGN COMPUTER GAMES, THAT IS WHAT I AM GOOD AT. IT IS TRUE, YOU NEED A NURSE. YOU ARE GOING TO GET SICK SOMETIMES. WE ALL WANT TO LIVE SOME WAY. WE GOT TO HAVE PEOPLE BUILDING OUR HOUSES. WE WANT TO BE HERE WORKING AT WHITNEY BROTHERS. SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO BE MAKING -- >> [INDISCERNIBLE] PAM: WE ARE NOT ALL COMPUTER GEEKS. I DO NOT THINK I COULD BE ONE IF I TRIED. YOU HAVE TO FIND YOUR FIT, YOU KNOW. BUT I THINK THE GENERATION COMING UP NEEDS THAT PUSH TO SAY, WELL, HERE ARE SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS TO DO BESIDES SIT IN FRONT THE COMPUTER YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. SECRETARY CLINTON: ONE OF THE KIDS THEY TOLD ME ABOUT AT THIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE, ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROGRAM, GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND GOT A $40,000 JOB AS A WELDER, BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A SHORTAGE. THERE WAS A TWO-YEAR PROGRAM, PASSED A NATIONAL CERTIFICATION. HERE HE IS, 18 YEARS OLD, AND STARTING OFF ON A REALLY GOOD TRACK. YEAH. >> YOU PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN I DO, BUT I HEARD THERE ARE SEVERAL HIGH SCHOOLS IN CHICAGO THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH IBM IS ONE OF THEM, AND IT IS AN EIGHT-YEAR PROGRAM, NOT FOUR YEARS, AND THESE KIDS ARE TRAINED THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND INTO THIS EXTENDED HIGH SCHOOL, AS IT WERE, BEING MENTORED BY IBM. AND WHEN THEY GET DONE, THEY ARE GUARANTEED A JOB AT $40,000 A YEAR IN THE COMPANY. AND SO, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR TRAINING RIGHT HERE. AND I THINK FIVE OUT OF THE EIGHT SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY ARE IN CHICAGO. SECRETARY CLINTON: THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF MODEL THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND TRY DO SEE WHERE WE COULD INTIMATE THAT. >> IMPLEMENT THAT -- IMPLEMENT THAT. WE HAVE TO TRY ALL KINDS OF APPROACHES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS ALREADY WORKING AND DO MORE OF THAT. AND THEN I THINK YOU MAKE A STRONG POINT, WE HAVE TO PERSUADE, PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY, THAT THIS IS PART OF THE ECONOMY THAT REALLY NEEDS THEM. AND, YEAH, SOME MIGHT WANT TO BE COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS AND SOME MIGHT WANT TO BE THE BEST WELDER OR THE BEST PLUMBER. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THAT IS A GOOD ROUTE FOR THEM. DAVE, WE WILL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE -- HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED HERE? DAVE: 32 YEARS. A LONG TIME. IT HAS BEEN GREAT. IT IS A WONDERFUL INDUSTRY. I GET TO DO R&D WORK BY GOING TO CHILDCARE CENTERS. YOU GET THE FOUR-YEAR-OLDS RUNNING AROUND. IT IS REALLY QUITE -- I HAVE AN ENVIABLE JOB. BUT I AM STILL A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND AS SUCH I HAVE THE WORRIES ALSO. IT IS NOT ALL PEACH AND CREAM. IN 2006, WE HAD A FLOOD. AND ACTUALLY THERE WAS ABOUT TWO FEET OF WATER WHERE WE WERE SITTING. AND THE SBA WAS GREAT TO GIVE US A LOW-INTEREST LOAN. KUDOS TO THE SBA. I GUESS ONE FINAL QUESTION I WOULD ASK, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. WE LIKE KEEPING OUR MACHINES UP TO DATE, AND THE LAST YEARS WE HAVE BEEN WRITING OFF THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE YEAR THEY WERE INSTALLED. AND NOW IN 2015, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT REDUCING THAT TO $25,000. I KNOW THAT IS CONGRESS, BUT I AM CURIOUS AS TO YOUR FEELING. I MEAN, IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE OURS TO IMPROVE THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE AND NOT MAKE IT SO ONEROUS SO THAT WE CAN SPREAD IT OUT AND STILL DO RIGHT EYE THE IRS? >> BY THE IRS -- BY THE RS IRS? SECRETARY CLINTON: THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE ANY MORE ONEROUS. I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN BOTH MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT, AND, LIKE THAT NEW PRINTING MACHINE THAT YOU SHOULD BECOME A NEW EQUIPMENT, IF THAT IS GOING TO MAKE YOU COMPETITIVE. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE TAX SYSTEM AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS AN ECONOMIC INVESTMENT AS OPPOSED TO ONE WITHOUT ECONOMIC PURPOSE, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE, WHERE PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY PLAYING GAMES AND -- CAPITAL GAINS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR, EXAMPLE, A WAY TO REWARD PEOPLE WHO MADE RISKY INVESTMENTS, INVESTING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS, AND NOW IT IS JUST BEING CHURNED. YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WHOLE TAX SYSTEM. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU, I WOULD NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOUR BUSINESS MORE DIFFICULT TO RUN, BECAUSE YOU HAVE REAL ECONOMIC IMPERATIVES. YOU ARE IN THE PRODUCTION GOODS, AND I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO SUPPORT GOODS AND REAL SERVICES AND TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT IS NOW BEING DONE IN THE TRADING WORLD, WHICH IS JUST TRADING FOR THE SAKE OF TRADING. IT'S JUST WRONG THAT A HEDGE FUND MANAGER PAYS LOWER TAX RATE THAN A NURSE OR TRUCKER OR AN ASSEMBLY WORKER HERE AT WHITNEY BROTHERS. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO SAY, LOOK, IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WHICH IS ENHANCING THE ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY OF YOUR BUSINESS AND THE LARGER ECONOMY, WE WILL BE OPEN TO THAT. BUT IF IT'S JUST PLAYING BACK AND FORTH IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE TO GET .1% ADVANTAGE, MAYBE WE SHOULD NOT LET THAT GO ON. BECAUSE THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY AT THE ROOT OF SOME OF THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT WE ALL REMEMBER PAINFULLY FROM 2008. SO I THINK THAT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, I WOULD WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO MADE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE AND PROFITABLE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT 40-PLUS PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES AND FAMILIES DEPEND ON THAT. DAVE: I THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. I KNOW THE SECRETARY HAS A BUSY SCHEDULE, SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS WORKS. SECRETARY CLINTON: I THINK WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS A PICTURE WITH EVERYONE WHO WAS IN THE ROUNDTABLE, AND THEN I WANT TO SAY HELLO TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE HERE. IF YOU COULD COME STAND BEHIND ME AND GET A PICTURE. CAN YOU GET US ALL IN, BARB? THIS IS GREAT. DON'T GET LOST. OK. THIS IS GREAT. THANK YOU. >> CAN I GET A PICTURE OF YOU? SECRETARY CLINTON: SURE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? >> UPSTATE NEW YORK. >> ONE OF MY COUSINS IS THERE NOW. HE IS IN OUR AGE GROUP. >> YOU'RE KIDDING. >> THEY ARE IN OUR AGE GROUP. SECRETARY CLINTON: YOUNG PEOPLE. >> YOU WERE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. SECRETARY CLINTON: SO BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE THE HUDSON VALLEY. THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THIS. I AM GOING TO SAY HELLO TO SOME PEOPLE. >> [NO AUDIO] [NO AUDIO] >>",2015-11-07 17:42:44,2015-04-20,Keene,New Hampshire
http://www.c-span.org/video/?325251-1/senator-marco-rubio-rfl-presidential-campaign-announcement,Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) Presidential Campaign Announcement,Marco Rubio,"WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE HERE OR C-SPAN. WE'RE LIVE AT THE FREEDOM TOWER IN MIAMI WHERE SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SHORTLY WILL ANNOUNCE HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. IN THE 1960'S, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USED THIS BUILDING TO PROCESS REFUGEES WHO HAD FLED CUBA AFTER FIDEL CASTRO CAME TO POWER. AND SENATOR RUBIO HIMSELF, THE SON OF CUBAN IMMIGRANTS. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MARCO RUBIO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING ""MARCO""] SENATOR RUBIO: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT IS A LOT OF CELL PHONES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AFTER MONTHS OF DELB RATION AND PRAYER ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY, I HAVE COME HERE TONIGHT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON HOW I BELIEVE I CAN BEST SERVE YOU. I CHOSE TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE FREEDOM TOWER BECAUSE IT IS TRULY A SYMBOL OF OUR NATION'S IDENTITY AS A LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. AND I AM MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER THAT DESPITE OUR TROUBLES, WE HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER TO MAKE OUR TIME ANOTHER AMERICAN CENTURY. IN THE VERY ROOM FIVE DECADES AGO, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CUBAN COMPILES BEGAN THEIR NEW LIVES IN AMERICA -- EXILES BEGAN THEIR NEW LIVES IN AMERICA. THAT'S PART OF A LARGER STORY OF THE AMERICAN MIRACLE. HOW UNITED BY A COMMON FAITH IN THEIR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO GO AS FAR AS THEIR TALENT AND WORK WILL TAKE THEM, A COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANTS AND EXILES, FORMER SLAVES AND REFUGEES, TOGETHER BUILT THE FREEST AND MOST PROSPEROUS NATION EVER. YOU SEE, FOR ALMOST ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY, POWER AND WEALTH BELONGED ONLY TO A SELECT FEW. MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE EVER LIVED WERE TRAPPED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR BIRTH. DESTINED TO LIVE THE LIFE THEIR PARENTS HAD. BUT AMERICA'S DIFFERENT. BECAUSE HERE WE ARE THE CHILDREN AND THE GRANDCHILDREN OF PEOPLE WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT THIS. [APPLAUSE] BOTH OF MY PARENTS WERE BORN TO POOR FAMILIES IN CUBA. AFTER HIS MOTHER DIED, MY FATHER HAD TO GO WORK WHEN HE WAS 9 YEARS OLD. MY MOTHER WAS ONE OF SEVEN GIRLS RAISED BY A DISABLED FATHER WHO STRUGGLED TO PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY. WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG, MY PARENTS HAD BIG DREAMS FOR THEMSELVES. BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN -- BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT BORN INTO WEALTH OR POWER, THE FUTURE WAS DESTINED TO BE DEFINED BY THEIR PAST. AND SO IN 1956 THEY CAME HERE TO AMERICA. TO THE ONE PLACE ON EARTH WHERE THE ASPIRATIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE THEM COULD BE MORE THAN JUST DREAMS. HERE IN AMERICA MY FATHER BECAME A BARTENDER. MY MOTHER, A CASHIER, A MAID, A K-MART STOCK CLERK. THEY NEVER MADE IT BIG. BUT THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL. TWO IMMIGRANTS WITH LITTLE MONEY OR EDUCATION FOUND STABLE JOBS, OWNED A HOME, RETIRED WITH SECURITY AND GAVE ALL FOUR OF THEIR CHILDREN A LIFE BETTER THAN THEIR OWN. MY PARENTS ACHIEVED WHAT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE PROBLEM IS NOW, TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE STARTING TO DOUBT WHETHER ACHIEVING THAT DREAM IS STILL POSSIBLE. HARDWORKING FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, ONE UNEXPECTED EXPENSE AWAY FROM DISASTER. YOUNG AMERICANS UNABLE TO START A CAREER OR A BUSINESS OR A FAMILY BECAUSE THEY OWE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOANS FOR DEGREES THAT DID NOT EVEN LEAD TO JOBS. AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE LUCK TO STRUGGLE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MORE TAXES, MORE REGULATION AND MORE GOVERNMENT. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? IN A COUNTRY THAT FOR OVER TWO CENTURIES HAS BEEN DEFINED BY EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY? IT'S BECAUSE WHILE OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ECONOMY ARE PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE 21ST CENTURY, TOO MANY OF OUR LEADERS AND THEIR IDEAS ARE STUCK IN THE 20TH CENTURY. [APPLAUSE] THEY'RE BUSY LOOKING BACKWARDS. SO THEY DO NOT SEE HOW JOBS AND PROSPERITY TODAY DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY. AND SO OUR LEADERS PUT US AT A DISADVANTAGE. BY TAXING AND BORROWING AND REGULATING LIKE IT WAS 1999. [LAUGHTER] THEY LOOK AT YESTERDAY SO THEY DO NOT SEE THE GOOD PAYING MODERN JOBS REQUIRE DIFFERENT SKILLS AND MORE EDUCATION THAN THE PAST, SO THEY BLINDLY SUPPORT AN OUTDATED HIRE EDUCATION -- HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND TOO INACCESSIBLE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST. AND THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN, THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WHEN AMERICA FAILS TO LEAD GLOBAL PAYOFF INEVITABLY FOLLOWS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO THEY APPEASE OUR ENEMIES, THEY BETRAY OUR ALLIES AND THEY WEAKEN OUR MILITARY. AT THE TURN OF THE 19TH CENTURY, A GENERATION OF AMERICANS HARNESSED THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE AND THEY TRANSFORMED THIS COUNTRY INTO THE LEADING ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND THE 20TH CENTURY BECAME THE AMERICAN CENTURY. NOW THE TIME HAS COME FOR THIS GENERATION TO LEAD A WAY TOWARDS A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF WE REFORM OUR TAX CODE AND REDUCE REGULATIONS AND CONTROL SPENDING AND MODERNIZE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS AND REPEAL OR REPLACE OBAMACARE, IF WE DO THESE THINGS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF WE DO THESE THINGS, IF WE DO THESE THINGS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF BETTER PAYING MODERN JOBS. IF WE CREATE A 21ST CENTURY SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT PROVIDES WORKING AMERICANS THE CHANCE TO ACQUIRE THE SKILLS THEY NEED, THAT NO LONGER GRADUATES STUDENTS WITH MOUNTAINS OF DEBT AND DEGREES THAT DO NOT LEAD TO JOBS, AND THAT GRADUATES MORE STUDENTS FROM HIGH SCHOOL READY TO WORK, THEN OUR PEOPLE WILL BE PREPARED TO SEIZE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS NEW ECONOMY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF WE REMEMBER THAT THE FAMILY, NOT THE GOVERNMENT, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN OUR SOCIETY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF WE REMEMBER THAT ALL HUMAN LIFE DESERVES PROTECTION OF OUR LAWS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IF WE REMEMBER THAT ALL PARENTS DESERVE TO CHOOSE THE EDUCATION THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEIR CHILDREN, THEN WE WILL HAVE A STRONG PEOPLE AND A STRONG NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IF AMERICA ONCE AGAIN ACCEPTS THE MANTLE OF GLOBAL LEADERSHIP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY ABANDONING THIS ADMINISTRATION'S DANGEROUS CONCESSIONS TO IRAN AND ITS HOSTILITY TO ISRAEL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY REVERSING THE HOLLOWING OUT OF OUR MILITARY, BY GIVING OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM THE RESOURCES, THE CARE AND THE GRATITUDE THAT THEY DESERVE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY NO LONGER BEING PASSIVE IN THE FACE OF CHINESE AND RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. [APPLAUSE] AND BY ENDING THE NEAR TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE EROSION OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY CUBA, VENEZUELA, NICARAGUA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEN, IF WE DID THESE THINGS, THEN OUR NATION WOULD BE SAFER, OUR WORLD MORE STABLE, AND OUR PEOPLE MORE PROSPEROUS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE MUST DO. BUT THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT LAWS WE'RE GOING TO PASS. THIS ELECTION IS A GENERATIONAL CHOICE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE WILL BE. JUST YESTERDAY A LEADER FROM YESTERDAY BEGAN A CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT BY PROMISING TO TAKE US BACK TO YESTERDAY. YESTERDAY IS OVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK. WE AMERICANS ARE PROUD OF OUR HISTORY. BUT OUR COUNTRY HALLS BEEN ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND BEFORE US NOW IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER THE GREATEST -- AUTHOR THE GREATEST CHAPTER YET IN THE AMAZING STORY OF AMERICA. BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT BY GOING BACK TO THE LEADERS AND IDEAS OF THE PAST. WE MUST CHANGE THE DECISIONS WE ARE MAKING BY CHANGING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY TONIGHT, GROUNDED BY THE LESSONS OF OUR HISTORY, BUT INSPIRED BY THE PROMISE OF OUR FUTURE, I ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW MY CANDIDACY MIGHT SEEM IMPROBABLE TO SOME WATCHING FROM ABROAD. AFTER ALL, IN MANY COUNTRIES THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND IS RESERVED FOR THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL. BUT I LIVE IN AN EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY. I LIVE IN AN EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY WHERE EVEN THE SON OF A BARTENDER AND A MAID CAN HAVE THE SAME DREAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I LIVE IN AN EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY WHERE THE SON OF A BAR TENDSER AND A MAID CAN HAVE THE SAME DREAM AND THE SAME FUTURE AS THOSE WHO COME FROM POWER AND PRIVILEGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES OF THIS CAMPAIGN. AND I RECOGNIZE THE DEMANDS OF THIS OFFICE THAT I SEEK. BUT IN THIS ENDEAVOR, AS IN ALL THINGS, I FIND COMFORT IN THE ANCIENT COMMAND. BE STRONG AND CRAGEOWLS. DO NOT TREMBLE OR BE DISMAID FOR THE LORD, YOUR GOD, IS WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU GO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'VE HEARD SOME SUGGEST THAT I SHOULD STEP ASIDE AND WAIT MY TURN. BUT I CANNOT. BECAUSE I BELIEVE OUR VERY IDENTITY AS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATION IS AT STAKE AND I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M HUMBLED BY THE REALIZATION THAT AMERICA DOESN'T OWE ME ANYTHING. BUT I HAVE A DEBT TO AMERICA I MUST TRY TO REPAY. THIS ISN'T JUST THE COUNTRY WHERE I WAS BORN. AMERICA'S LITERALLY THE PLACE THAT CHANGED MY FAMILY'S HISTORY. I REGRET THAT MY FATHER DID NOT LIVE TO SEE THIS DAY IN PERSON. HE USED TO TELL ME ALL THE TIME, HE USED TO TELL US ALL THE TIME -- [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT MEANS IN THIS COUNTRY YOU WILL ACHIEVE ALL THE THINGS WE NEVER COULD. [APPLAUSE] ON THE DAYS WHEN I'M TIRED OR DISCOURAGED, I REMEMBER THE SOUNDS OF HIS KEYS JINGLING AT THE FRONT DOOR OF OUR HOME, WELL PAST MIDNIGHT, AS HE RETURNED FROM ANOTHER LONG DAY AT WORK. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I DIDN'T FULLY APPRECIATE ALL HE DID FOR US. BUT NOW AS MY OWN CHILDREN GROW OLDER, I MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND. MY FATHER WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK HE HAD. BUT THAT WAS NOT THE LIFE HE WANTED FOR HIS CHILDREN. HE WANTED ALL THE DREAMS HE ONCE HAD FOR HIMSELF TO COME TRUE FOR US. HE WANTED ALL THE DOORS THAT CLOSED FOR HIM TO OPEN FOR ME. AND SO MY FATHER STOOD BEHIND A SMALL PORTABLE BAR IN THE BACK OF A ROOM FOR ALL THOSE YEARS SO THAT TONIGHT I COULD STAND BEHIND THIS PODIUM IN FRONT OF THIS ROOM AND THIS NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT JOURNEY FROM BEHIND THAT BAR TO BEHIND THIS PODIUM, THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND WHETHER WE REMAIN A SPECIAL COUNTRY WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THAT JOURNEY IS STILL POSSIBLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT RIGHT NOW. THE SINGLE MOTHER WHO WORKS LONG HOURS FOR LITTLE PAY SO HER CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE THE WAY SHE HAS TO. THE YOUNG STUDENT WHO TAKES TWO BUSES BEFORE DAWN TO ATTEND A BETTER SCHOOL HALFWAY ACROSS TOWN. THE WORKERS IN OUR HOTEL KITCHENS, THE LANDSCAPING SCREW CREWS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, THE LATE NIGHT JANITORIAL STAFF WHO CLEAN OUR OFFICES AND EVEN THE BAR TENDERS WHO TONIGHT ARE STANDING IN THE BACK OF A ROOM SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA. IF THEIR AMERICAN DREAM'S BECOME IMPOSSIBLE, WE WILL HAVE JUST BECOME ANOTHER COUNTRY. BUT IF THEY SUCCEED, THIS 21ST CENTURY WILL ALSO BE AN AMERICAN CENTURY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS WILL BE THE MESSAGE OF MY CAMPAIGN. AND THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESIDENCY. AND TO SUCCEED ON THIS JOURNEY I WILL NEED YOUR PRAYERS AND YOUR SUPPORT AND ULTIMATELY YOUR VOTE. AND SO TONIGHT I'M ASKING TO YOU TAKE THAT FIRST STEP WITH ME BY JOINING US AT OUR WEBSITE, MARK OWERUBIO.COM -- MARCORUBIO.COM. MY WIFE, JI NET, AND MY -- GENNETT, AND MY FOUR CHILDREN WILL ARE HERE TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE NEXT 19 MONTHS WILL TAKE ME FAR AWAY FROM HOME. I'LL MISS WATCHING AMANDA RUN TRACK. AND DANIELA PLAY VOLLEYBALL AND ANTHONY PLAY FOOTBALL AND DOMINIC PLAY SOCCER. BUT I HAVE CHOSEN THIS COURSE BECAUSE THIS ELECTION, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THEM. THEIRS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT GENERATION IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE IF WE CAN CAPTURE THE PROMISE OF THIS NEW CENTURY, THEY WILL BE THE FREEST AND THE MOST PROSPEROUS AMERICANS THAT HAVE EVER LIVED. BUT IF WE FAIL, THEY WILL BE THE FIRST GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO INHERIT A COUNTRY WORSE OFF THAN THE ONE LEFT FOR THEIR PARENTS. THE FINAL VERDICT ON OUR GENERATION WILL BE WRITTEN BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE NOT YET BEEN BORN. LET US MAKE SURE THEY RECORD THAT WE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE, THAT IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS CENTURY, FACED WITH A RAPIDLY CHANGING AND UNCERTAIN WORLD, OUR GENERATION ROSE TO FACE THE GREAT CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. AND BECAUSE WE DID, BECAUSE WE DID, THERE WAS STILL ONE PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE WHO YOU COME FROM DOES NOT DETERMINE HOW FAR YOU GO. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WE DID THE AMERICAN MIRACLE LIVED ON. BECAUSE WE DID, OUR CHILDREN AND THEIRS LIVED IN A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU.

[ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, EVERYONE. YOU CAN BE SEATED. WE ARE SO THRILLED TO HAVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU HERE BUT EVEN MORE EXCITED TO HAVE WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE PERSON THAT IS MOST READY FOR LEADING OUR NATION BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN TRIED, SHE'S BEEN TESTED. I'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE EARLIER THIS MORNING THERE'S NO OTHER HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET THAT HAS THE RESUME THAT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON HAS. [ APPLAUSE ] BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR HILLARY CAMPAIGN STAFFER WHO'S NOW LIVING WITH US HERE IN MASON CITY, I WANT TO WELCOME A FEW OF THE VERY IMPORTANT FOLKS THAT DO THE DAY-TO-DAY DEMOCRATIC BUSINESS HERE IN THE GREATER NORTH IOWA AREA. AND WE HAVE WITH US A LIST OF PEOPLE. AS I CALL YOUR NAME, WOULD YOU KIND OF HOLD UP YOUR HAND AND STEP FORWARD? SO MADAM SECRETARY CAN SEE YOU. AND THEN HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE TO THE END OF THE LIST, IF YOU WOULD. AND WE'LL LET YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE FOLKS. SO IF YOU'RE SITTING, MAYBE STAND. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE JOHN COLUMBO, CHAIR OF THE FRANKLIN COUNTY DEMOCRATS. HE'S BELOW THE LIGHT OVER THERE. [ APPLAUSE ] HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE. STATE SENATOR AMANDA REAGAN, OUR STATE SENATOR FROM MASON CITY DISTRICT. D.O. KOHNING, FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM ST. ANSGOR. AND JAY ERR DAUL, IS HE IN THE HOUSE? HE HAD SOMETHING COME UP I KNOW AND COULDN'T BE HERE. PHIL DOHERTY, OUR COUNTY SUPERVISOR. PHIL'S RIGHT OVER HERE IN THE BLUE SHIRT. ALEX KUND, COUNCILMAN AT LARGE FOR THE MASON CITY COUNCIL. PAT RIGHT, OUR SARAGOTA COUNTY TREASURER. AND COLLEEN PIERCE, OUR DEMOCRATIC SARAGOTA COUNTY REPORTER. WE HAVE ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE, TODD PRITCHARD FROM THE STATE OF IOWA. WE ALSO HAVE WITH US TWO FOLKS THAT HAVE WELCOMED SARAH TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. AND WE WERE GOING TO BE GONE FOR TEN DAYS WHEN SARAH LANDED AND I SAYS JOANNE, CAN YOU HELP ME OUT, WE'VE GOT A YOUNG LADY COMING WORKING FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND WE NEED A PLACE FOR HER TO STAY AND THOSE TWO PEOPLE WHO STEPPED UP WERE JO ANN HARDY RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME AND HER HUSBAND RUSS HARDY. THERE IN THE BLUE JACKET. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I WAS JUST REMINDED THAT GOOD B. A MONTH AGO -- OH, YES. A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [ APPLAUSE ] ABOUT A MONTH AGO A YOUNG LADY GAVE ME A CALL AND SHE GOES HI, MY NAME'S SARAH, CAN I CUSTOM TALK TO YOU? AND I SAID SURE, WE TALK TO EVERYBODY. WE'RE A WELCOMING HOUSEHOLD. COME AHEAD. WE SAT ON THIS WHITE SOFA THAT USUALLY SITS IN A CIRCULAR FASHION HERE IN THE LIVING ROOM, AND SHE TOLD ME ABOUT SOMEBODY SHE REALLY WAS EXCITED ABOUT AND THAT SHE WAS COMING HERE TO LIVE AND START WORK. SO IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO TURN THE MICROPHONE OVER TO OUR VERY OWN SARAH MARINO. >> GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. FOR THOSE OF YOU I HAVEN'T YET MET, AS GENE SAID, I'M SARAH MARINO. AND I AM THE ORGANIZER HERE IN SEROGORDO COUNTY. I ALSO COVER FRANKLY LYNN, FLOYD, WIKASHEE, HOWARD, AND MITCHELL COUNTIES. I THINK I GOT THEM ALL. I'LL TAKE A COUPLE MORE IF YOU WANT. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M NEW TO IOWA. I'M ORIGINALLY FROM BEDFORD, NEW YORK. JUST A FEW MILES AWAY FROM CHAPPAQUA WHERE OUR SPECIAL GUEST HERE TODAY LIVES. BUT I'M LIVING RIGHT HERE IN MASON CITY, WHERE EVERYONE HAS BEEN SO WELCOMING AND HELPFUL. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TO AWFUL YOU WHO HAVE MADE IT VERY EASY TO CALL NORTH IOWA MY NEW HOME. SO I'M INVOLVED WITH THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN A FIGHTER FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND FOR WOMEN LIKE MY MOM, MY FRIENDS, MY COUSINS, MY AUNTS, MY SISTER. MY LITTLE SISTER MAGGIE IS 18. SHE'S ABOUT TO GRADUATE FROM HRGH SCHOOL IN A MONTH, AND SHE'S HEADING OFF TO COLLEGE TO MARKETING. AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO IMPRESSED BY HER DEDICATION AND HER DRIVE TO THE SUBJECT THAT SHE LOVES. AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE GLASS CEILING I KNOW MY SISTER IS GOING TO BREAK NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW IN HER FIELD. SO I'M HERE TO FIGHT FOR HER BECAUSE SHE DESERVES, AS SHE STARTS HER CAREER, TO BE PAID THE SAME AS HER MALE COLLEAGUES. [ APPLAUSE ] AND ITEM SO PROUD TO BE WORKING FOR A CHAMPION FOR YOUNG WOMEN LIKE MAGGIE. FOR THAT AND MANY, MANY OTHER REASONS I AM SO THRILLED AND PROUD TO BE HERE. BUT TO BUILD UP THIS CAMPAIGN WE NEED THE SUPPORT AND THE INPUT OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM. WE NEED YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOUR CO-WORKERS TO GET INVOLVED TO MAKE THIS CAUCUS A SUCCESS. WE'VE BEEN STARTING TO HAVE COMMUNITY EVENTS LIKE HOUSE PARTIES, COFFEE CHATS, BOOK CLUBS, POT LUKZLUCKS ALL ACROSS THE STATE JUST TO START THE CONVERSATION AND OPIATE DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY PLEASE FILL OUT ONE OF THESE COMMIT TO CAUCUS CARDS SAYING YOU'LL COMMIT TO CAUCUS ON FEBRUARY 1st FOR HILLARY. AND IF YOU HAVE ALREADY FILLED ONE OUT PLEASE TAKE ONE HOENL, HAVE A FRIEND FILL IT OUT BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING TO IDENTIFY SUPPORTERS ALL ACROSS IOWA AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. AND THOSE OF YOU IN THIS Rjaz ARE THE MOST EQUIPPED TO HELP US IDENTIFY SUPPORT ALL ACROSS THE STATE. YOU AN ALSO JOIN US ONLINE. WE HAVE OUR HILLARY FOR IOWA FACEBOOK PAGE AND WE ALSO HAVE LOCAL FACEBOOK GROUPS. SO YOU CAN JOIN NORTHEAST CENTRAL IOWA FOR HILLARY AND NORTHWEST CENTRAL IOWA FOR HILLARY. AND YOU CAN FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER. IT'S @SMARINO92. TO STAY UPDATED. BUT OF COURSE YOU ALL AREN'T HERE TO HEAR FROM ME. SO WITH THAT I AM SO HONORED TO INTRODUCE OUR CANDIDATE, FORMER SENATOR, FIRST LADY, SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU. WOW. THANK YOU. I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU. AND SARAH, THAT WAS EXCQ&LENT. I THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND I HOPE YOU'LL GET TO KNOW SARAH AND SPEND TIME WITH HER AND HELP HER AS SHE WORKS SO HARD BETWEEN NOW AND FEBRUARY 1st. AND DEAN AND GARY, THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING US TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL HOME WHAT A DELIGHT IT IS TO BE HERE WITH YOU.-SOMEBODY ASKED ME THE OTHER DAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO THESE EVENTS WHERE YOU'RE TAKING TIME TO ACTUALLY TALK AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE, IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO? AND I SAID, YES, IT IS. BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO I LEARN A LOT BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE IT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT WILL NOT O'LY GIVE ME A FIRM FOUNDATION IN THE CAUCUS HERE IN IOWA OR IN A PRIMARY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BECAUSE IT REALLY IS ABOUT PEOPLE TO PEOPLE CONNECTIONS IF WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO, BUT IT WILL ALSO I NEED TO BE AN EVEN BETTER PRESIDENT. AND I JUST HAD ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT. YOU MAY KNOW THAT GARY'S A RADIOLOGIST, AND RIGHT BEFORE WE CAME IN WE W HIS WORK. HE'S AN EXPERT IN BREAST CANCER. AND I Aa)Q"" HIM ABOUT THE MAMMOGRAPHY RECOMMENDATION THAT'S AT LEAST THE WOMEN IN THE ROOM I'M SURE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND HE WAS GIVING ME SOME REALLY IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE COMMISSION THAT MADE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HIS EXPERT OPINION ABOUT THEM. I'M SO GRATEFUL TO YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE KIND OF DISCUSSION YOU CAN'T HAVE UNLESS YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK AND LISTEN WITH PEOPLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE THIS CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU. I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS I'LL SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK INDIVIDUALLY AND I'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. I HAVE BEEN INCRQ""IBLY IMPRESSED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AT HOW HARD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE WORKED TO PULL OURSELVES OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION. PEOPLE HAVE MADE SACRIFICES. PEOPLE HAVE LOST JOBS. THEY'VE LOST HOUSES. THEY LOST THE CHANCE TO FINISH OR GO ON WITH THEIR EDUCATION. AND THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF TO DO TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. AND I'M SO RELIEVED THAT AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TALK WITH PEOPLE THERE IS A SENSE THAT WE ARE ON OUR FEET. WE'RE NOT RUNNING YET BUT WE ARE ON OUR FEET. AND WE CAN SEE THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND PUT THEM IN A CONTEXT AS TO WHERE WE GO FROM HERE NOW AS A COUNTRY. I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE HARD DECISIONS HE MADE WHEN HE INHERITED THE MESS HE INHERITED WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN 2009. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I KNOW THAT HE AND I AND EVERYONE WHO WAS IN HIS ADMINISTRATION REALIZES THAT UNLESS THE AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN WORKER IS STRONG EVERYTHING WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN FOR OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. AND SO I COME TO THIS CAMPAIGN COMMITTED TO BEING A CHAMPION FOR AMERICANS AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. THAT'S WHAT MY WORK HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. STARTING WITH MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE WORK THAT I DID AS SECRETARY OF STATE PROMOTING WOMEN'S RIGHTS, PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE MARGE MARGINALIZED OR LEFT ON THE SIDELINES. AND I KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE TO -- IT'S STILL HARD TO IMAGINE EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST GETTING BY BUT GETTING AHEAD AND STAYING AHEAD. BECAUSE LOOK, THE DECK IS STILL STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP. WE KNOW THAT. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE ESPECIALLY FOCUSED ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO BRING ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT WILL IGNITE OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE WILLING TO WORK HARD FOR IT AGAIN. SO WHEN I LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE AS A NATION AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE, I SEE FOUR BIG CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE ON TOGETHER. AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTS. BECAUSE IF THEY WERE EASY THEY WOULD ALREADY BE DONE. SO I WILL POSIT THAT RIGHT NOW. NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE TO BUILD THE ECONOMY OF TOMORROW, NOT YESTERDAY. IT NEEDS TO BE INNOVATIVE. IT NEEDS TO BE SUSTAINABLE. IT NEEDS TO BE PRODUCING GOOD JOBS WITH RISING WAGES. WE NEED TO GET BACK INTO THE HABIT OF ACTUALLY REWARDING WORKERS WITH INCREASES IN THEIR PAYCHECKS FOR THE INCREASES IN PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY THAT THEY HAVE HELPED TO BRING ABOUT. [ APPLAUSE ] WARREN BUFFETT HAS SAID, IT BUT SO HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHEN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CEO MAKES 300 TIMES MORE THAN THE TYPICAL AMERICAN WORKER. OR WHEN HEDGE FUND MANAGERS THEMSELVES MAKE MORE AND PAY LESS IN TAXES THAN NURSES AND TRUCK DRIVERS. IN FACT, I HEARD A STATISTIC THE OTHER DAY THAT REALLY MADE A BIG IMPACT ON ME, THAT THE TOP 25 HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TOGETHER MADE MORE MONEY THAN ALL THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN AMERICA. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT VALUE, WHAT IT IS THAT'S GOING TO GET US MOVING AGAIN, I THINK KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. [ APPLAUSE ] AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A CLAIM ON BECOMING THE 21st CENTURY CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. IOWA HAS REALLY HELPED US. THE RFS, THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD, AND A LOT OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HERE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE MADE SOME REAL PROGRESS BUT NOT NEAR ENOUGH. AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO SEIZE THAT TITLE UNLESS WE DO WHAT WE HAVE TO. IT'S ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS THROUGH EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING AND SKILLS NOT JUST IN REALITY. SO THEY CAN MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR OWN LIVES. AND FOR ME THAT STARTS AT THE VERY BEGINNING. I'VE BEEN A CHILD ADSXROEKT A CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROPONENT FOR MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I REALLY CARE ABOUT, WHAT I BELIEVE IN. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO START BEFORE KINDERGARTEN. WE HAVE TO HAVE UNIVERSAL PREK BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO MORE TO REACH OUT TO FAMILIES SO THEY KNOW THE TOOLS THEY SHOULD USE TO BE THEIR CHILDREN'S FIRST TEACHERS. WE'VE GOT THIS NEW GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS UNBELIEVABLE. WE WERE WITH HER THIS WEEKEND. YOU KNOW, WE GO AND JUST STARE AT HER. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT -- IT'S WONDERFUL AND SILLY AT THE SAME TIME. BUT WE ALSO READ TO HER. HERE SHE IS 7 1/2 MONTHS OLD, WE'RE READING AND READING AND READING. AND I IMAGINE AMONG HER FIRST WORDS WILL BE ""ENOUGH WITH THE READING"" BECAUSE BETWEEN HER MOM AND HER DAD AND BILL AND I WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THAT. BUT WE'RE DOING IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE LOVE TO DO IT AND WE LOVE TO SEE HER BEGIN TO REACH HER HANDS OUT AND GRAB ONTO THE BOOKS, WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT AIDS HER BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT DISCOVERIES WITH BRAIN RESEARCH IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. WE INCREASINGLY CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE LITERALLY FEEDING THE BRAIN AS WELL AS THE BODY OF THESE INFANTS AND THEN THE BABIES AND THE TODDLERS. THAT WILL HELP THEM BE BETTER PREPARED WHEN THEY ACTUALLY END UP IN KINDERGARTEN, AND IT WILL BEGIN TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR OUR GRANDDAUGHTER. CHARLOTTE WILL GET EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. BUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WILL SHE GROW UP IN? AND WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL SHE ENTER? AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ALL OF THE OTHER INFANTS, BABIES, TODDLERS AND CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY? SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EDUCATION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN TO EMPOWER OUR TEACHERS, TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF PARENTS SO THAT THEY CAN DO THE JOB THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO DO TO HELP PREPARE OUR KIDS. AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT COLLEGE IS AFFORDABLE. AND THAT CANNOT HAPPEN AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING UNLESS WE CHANGE THE WAY WE FUND COLLEGE EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WISH TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE. MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM I BET, AS I DID, BORROWED MONEY TO GO TO COLLEGE. BUT THEN WE WERE ABLE TO PAY IT BACK BECAUSE IT WASN'T SUCH AN OVERWHELMING BURDEN AS IT HAS BECOME NOW. THE AVERAGE STUDENT IN IOWA GRADUATES WITH $30,000 IN DEBT, AND THAT THEN MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO START A BUSINESS OR BUY A NEW HOME OR EVEN GET MARRIED, AS ONE YOUNG MAN TOLD ME NOT SO LONG AGO. SO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE INDEBTEDNESS TO TRY TO MOVE TOWARD MAKING COLLEGE AS DEBT-FREE AS POSSIBLE. I'M 100% BEHIND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PROPOSAL FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE'VE GOT TO TRY TO GET THAT THROUGH, AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO TRY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE COLLEGE AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE TO ALL OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY TODAY, IT IS ABSOLUTELY LINKED TO EDUCATION. IT IS ALSO LINKED TO STRONG FAMILIES AND STRONG COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S OUR SECOND CHALLENGE. BECAUSE A LOT OF FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN UNDER TREMENDOUS STRAIN. ONE OF THE BIGGEST STRESSES IN ANYBODY'S LIFE IS HEALTH CARE. I WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND I WILL WORK TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ARE REQUIRED. [ APPLAUSE ] WE ARE REALLY NOW IN A DIFFERENT WORLD. 16 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHO NOW DO. WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT MEDICARE IS AS AVAILABLE AND PROTECTED AND AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE. AND WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WHERE THERE ARE CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE WE TRY TO FIND WAYS TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE TO MAKE THEM. I DON'T HEAR MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TALKING AS MUCH AS THEY USED TO ABOUT GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I THINK THE REASON IS BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE ENCOUNTERING FROM TIME TO TIME WHO HAVE BEEN HELPED. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT, WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE HEALTH CARE WE FINALLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR YOU? THAT IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE. BUT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS, AND I HEARD ABOUT THIS IN IOWA, IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A 26-YEAR-OLD BECOMES A 27-YEAR-OLD AND IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO BE ON HIS OR HER PARENTS' POLICY? THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST CHANGES IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AREN'T MAKING THE INCOME THEY NEED YET TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE. SO WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT TO SEE WHAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO TO HELP THEM. THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY THAT ARE HUGE STRAINS ON FAMILIES. AND I HEARD ABOUT THEM FIRST. I HEARD FIRST IN DAVENPORT, AND I HEARD ABOUT IT ALL ACROSS THE STATE UNTIL I GOT TO COUNCIL BLUFFS. ONE IS THE DRUG EPIDEMIC. METH, PILLS IN IOWA. AND THEN I GOT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND AT MY VERY FIRST COFFEE SHOP MEETING I HEARD ABOUT THE HEROIN EPIDEMIIC IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IN THE PAST YEAR I'VE BEEN TOLD RELIABLY WE'VE HAD MORE PEOPLE DIE OF DRUG OVERDOSES IN AMERICA THAN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY. THIS IS TEARING FAMILIES APART BUT IT IS BELOW THE SURFACE. PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO DEAL WITH. I ALSO HEARD A LOT ABOUT UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND SO MANY COMMUNITIES, SO MANY STATES TURNING THEIR BACKS ON PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. FACILITIES ARE BEING CLOSED. EVEN THOUGH WE NOW REQUIRE THERE TO BE TREATMENT IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AVAILABLE TREATMENT. NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES. THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN CALIFORNIA AT AN EVENT, AND I JUST SAID WHAT I SAID. I SAID, YOU KNOW, MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT BEING TREATED. WE CLAIM WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE PROBLEMS BUT IF WE DON'T HELP WITH MENTAL HEALTH WE'RE LEAVING OUT A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. AND A YOUNG WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND ASKED ME A QUESTION. SHE SAID DID YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING ALL THESE SUICIDES IN MY HIGH SCHOOL? I SAID NO, I DIDN'T KNOW. SHE SAID WE'VE HAD FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES IN THE LAST MONTH. THEN I WAS IN NEW YORK AT AN EVENT THIS PAST WEEK. SAID THE SAME THING I SAID TO YOU. I WAS VISITING WITH PEOPLE. AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SHE GOES, THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING MENTAL HEALTH. WE HAVE GONE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO FOUR FUNERALS OF FRIENDS OF MY CHILDREN WHO HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES. I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHEN I START RUNNING, WHEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, I DID NOT BELIEVE I WOULD BE STANDING IN YOUR LIVING ROOM TALKING ABOUT THE DRUG ABUSE PROBLEM, THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM, AND THE SUICIDE PROBLEM. BUT I'M NOW CONVINCED I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO RAISE IT, TO END THE STIGMA OF TALKING ABOUT IT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND WE ALSO HAVE A CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTS EVERYTHING WE DO, AND THAT IS TO FIX OUR DYSFUNCTIONAL POLITICAL SYSTEM. THAT UNDERLIES EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY HOPE TO GET DONE. I'M VERY COMMITTED TO MEETING WITH ANYBODY, GOING TO HAVE ANY CONVERSATION, TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO STAND OUR GROUND AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO WORK WITH US FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR COUNTRY, THE BETTERMENT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED A GOOD POSITIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM, WHETHER IT BE HEALTH CARE OR AID FOR COLLEGE OR ANYTHING ELSE. WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE UNACCOUNTABLE DARK MONEY IN POLITICS. I THINK THE SUPREME COURT MADE A GRAVE ERROR WITH ITS CITIZENS UNITED DECISION. AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN DO TO APPOINT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO WILL PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND NOT THE RIGHT OF BILLIONAIRES TO BUY ELECTIONS. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I'VE BEEN CONSULTING WITH A LOT OF LEGAL EXPERTS, AND STHF THEM THINK THERE MAY BE A WAY TO GET LEGISLATION THROUGH THAT WILL ENABLE US TO REGULATE THIS KIND OF USE OF MONEY IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM, WHICH IS SO CORRUPTIVE AND CORROSIVE. BUT OTHERS AGREE WITH FORMER JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEVENS WHO RECENTLY WROTE A BOOK IN WHICH HE SAID IT'S GOING TO TAKE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I WILL WORK FOR THAT IF THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THE KIND OF ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY, ON VOTING RIGHTS, AND ON THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM THAT INFLUENCES OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. NOW, FOURTH, WE HAVE CHALLENGES AROUND THE WORLD. AS I WAS COMING THROUGH THE GARAGE THERE'S A TV THAT DEAN AND GARY HAVE, AND IT WAS TALKING ABOUT ISIS IN IRAQ. WE HAVE THREATS THAT WE KNOW OF THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO ADDRESS. IT'S NOT JUST DICTATORS. ALSO DISEASE, CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH I THINK GLOBAL WARMING IS A THREAT TO US. BUT WE HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT AND STRONG IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO APPROACH THE PROBLEMS THAT AMERICA WILL BE CONFRONTING IN THE WORLD, AND WE MUST DO SO IN COOPERATION WITH OUR FRIENDS, OUR ALLIES, OUR FELLOW DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE WORLD. I AM CONVINCED THAT THE 21st CENTURY CAN ONCE AGAIN BE A CENTURY IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES LEADS AND HELPS TO SET THE VALUES AND THE STANDARDS. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN AGREEMENT, FIRST OF ALL, FOREMOST WITH OUR OWN COUNTRY AND OUR OWN KORNS ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT. I WAS OUTRAGED AND SAID AT THE TIME THAT WHEN A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS SENT A LETTER TO THE AYATOLLAH OF IRAN ESSENTIALLY CRITICIZING THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I DON'T CARE WHAT PARTY YOU ARE, WE HAVE ONE PRESIDENT AND WE SHOULD STAND BEHIND THAT PRESIDENT WHEN HE'S TRYING TO WORK OUT VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. [ APPLAUSE ] I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF HARD CHOICES AHEAD OF US. I WROTE A BOOK CALLED ""HARD CHOICES."" THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. BUT I THINK WE'RE MORE THAN UP TO IT. I AM A CONFIDENT OPTIMIST ABOUT WHERE AMERICA'S FUTURE LIES. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT AWARE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS WITH MY EYES WIDE OPEN ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I HAVE A LITTLE EXPERIENCE ABOUT THAT. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I FIND IT VERY REASSURING BECAUSE I DO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE TO KNOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND HOW BEST TO PROCEED. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE LIVING IN AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT IS NOT A TIME FOR EASY ANSWERS OR GLIB ANSWERS OR ONE-LINERS OR APPLAUSE LINES. THOSE ARE ALL GREAT. THAT'S PART OF CAMPAIGNING. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BOTH THE EXPERIENCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING TO DEAL WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE. AND I APPRECIATE WHAT BOTH DEAN AND SARAH SAID ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THAT I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO HAVE DURING THE LAST DECADES. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT I CAN GO INTO THAT OFFICE ON THE VERY DPIRS DAY AND BEGIN TO DO WHAT IS REQUIRED. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO VISITING WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU NOT ONLY AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE CAUCUSES. I WOULD BE HONORED TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT ON FEBRUARY 1st, AND THEN I WILL NEED YOUR HELP AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE JOHN ELECTION BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THIS ELECTION TO BE ABOUT ME. I WANT IT TO BE ABOUT US AND THE AGENDA WE WANT TO SET FOR OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAMPAIGNED SO HARD AGAINST THEN SENATOR OBAMA I WAS WORKING AS HARD AS I COULD, HE WAS WORKING AS HARD AS HE COULD. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY HE WON. AND THEN I WENT TO WORK TO MAKE SURE HE GOT ELECTED, OUR PRESIDENT. AND I WAS SO RELIEVED AND HAPPY WHEN THAT FINALLY HAPPENED. THE SUNDAY AFTER THE ELECTION BILL AND I WENT FOR A WALK IN AN AREA THAT SARAH WOULD KNOW. A BIG KIND OF NATURE PRESERVE NEAR WHERE WE BOTH LIVE. AND WE JUST WANTED TO LET DOWN BECAUSE WE'D BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO ELECT THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA. SO WE'RE WANDERING THROUGH THE WOODS, AND BILL'S PHONE RINGS. WHICH IS SORT OF A MIRACLE SINCE WE HAVE TERRIBLE CELL COVERAGE THERE. AND HE PULLED IT OUT OF HIS POCKET, AND IT WAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. AND HE SAID I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU AND HILLARY. AND BILL SAID, WELL, WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST. CAN WE GET HOME AND CALL YOU BACK? AND SO WE DID. AND WHEN HE CALLED BACK, WHEN BILL CALLED BACK HE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND THEN I TALKED TO HIM AND HE SAID TO ME I WANT YOU TO COME SEE ME IN CHICAGO. I SAID SURE, WHEN? HE SAID SHOON SOON AS YOU CAN GET HERE. SO I SAID OKAY. THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY I WENT TO CHICAGO, AND HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD SERVE AS SECRETARY OF STATE. AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, I REALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE, I'M VERY FLATTERED, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN DO IT. HE SAID NO, I KNOW WHAT I WANT AND I WANT YOU TO DO THIS. I SAID, WELL, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, I REALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE. AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK I CAN BEST WORK WITH YOU AND BEST SERVE YOU. HE GOES, LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN UNTIL YOU SAY YES. SO I TOLD HIM NO, YOU KNOW, AGAIN. LATER. AND HE JUST SAID DON'T CALL ME TILL YOU SAY YES. AND I DID TELL MY HUSBAND, HE'S SO PERSISTENT, I'VE TOLD HIM NO TWICE AND HE KEEPS SAYING, YOU KNOW, I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO SAY YES. AND BILL SAID, YEAH, WELL, I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME TWICE BEFORE YOU SAID YES. SO -- I GUESS THERE'S A CONNECTION THERE. SO THEN I STAYED UP THAT NIGHT. AND I THOUGHT, SUPPOSE I'D BEEN HONORED TO WIN AND I HAD WANTED THIS INCREDIBLY TALENTED AMERICAN TO BE IN MY CABINET AND I'D ASKED HIM, I'D WANT HIM TO SAY YES. AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO. SO I CALLED HIM AND SAID PRESIDENT-ELECT, I WOULD BE HONORED TO SERVE IN YOUR CABINET. AND WE IMMEDIATELY GOT STARTED TO WORK. A FEW MONTHS LATER ON MY VERY FIRST TRIP AS SECRETARY OF STATE I WENT TO ASIA. AND I WENT IN PARK BECAUSE EVERYBODY I CALLED, ALL OF THE LEADERS IN THE COUNTRIES THAT I SPOKE WITH WERE SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE UNITED STATES CARES ABOUT US ANYMORE. NOBODY'S BEEN PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO US. WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE. I SAID WE ARE AND THE PRESIDENT FEELS THAT WAY. SO I WENT OUT AND ONE OF THE COUNTRIES I WENT TO WAS INDONESIA. IN PART BECAUSE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COUNTRY BUT ALSO PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD HAD A PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH IT. AND MY IDEA WAS NOT ONLY TO TALK TO THE LEADERS BUT TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE, WHAT'S CALLED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY. SO THAT AS I WAS OUT THERE TALKING TO PRESIDENTS AND PRIME MINISTERS AND OTHERS I WOULD ALSO FIND WAYS OF TRYING TO CONNECT TO TELL PEOPLE, LOOK, THE UNITED STATES REALLY DOES CARE ABOUT THE THE WORLD WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE TOGETHER, AND THAT'S PART OF MY MESSAGE FROM MY NEW PRESIDENT. SO I WENT ON DB-- I AGREED TO GO ON A SHOW IN JAKARTA, WHICH WAS THEIR MORNING SHOW. AND IT WAS LIKE A COMBINATION OF MTV AND A REALITY SHOW AND ALL OF THAT. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO. SO I GO ONTO THE SET AND PEOPLE ARE JUMPING AND THEY'RE SINGING AND THEY'RE DANCING. AND IT'S CALLED ""THE AWESOME SHOW."" SO I'M ON ""THE AWESOME SHOW."" AND I'M TALKING A LITTLE BIT WITH THE INTERVIEWER. AND THEN THEY ASKED PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. AND SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE SAYS, I WANT TO ASK YOU, WE SAW YOU CAMPAIGNED VERY HARD AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE CAMPAIGNED VERY HARD AGAINST YOU. HE WON. YOU LOST. AND THEN HE ASKED YOU TO BE HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. WHY? AND I REALIZED, YOU KNOW, IN A LOT OF THESE NEW DEMOCRACIES AND OTHER PLACES OF COURSE, YOU RUN AGAINST SOMEBODY AND YOU LOSE, YOU COULD GET EXILED OR IMPRISONED, EVEN KILLED, NOT ASKED TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. SO THIS WAS A VERY LEGITIMATE QUESTION. AND I THOUGHT I HAVE TO ANSWER THIS IN A VERY, YOU KNOW, SERIOUS WAY THAT MAYBE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND. IF N. OUR DEMOCRACY WE DO TRY TO CLOSE RANKS AFTER WE HAVE HARD ELECTIONS. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. SO I SAID, WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. WE CAMPAIGNED HARD. HE WON. I LOST. I THEN CAMPAIGNED TO GET HIM ELECTED. HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. AND I SAID YES. FOR THE SAME REASON. WE BOTH LOVE OUR COUNTRY. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY TO ME THAT'S WHAT ELECTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. WE CAN DISAGREE. AND WE WILL. WE'LL HAVE ALL KINDS OF ARGUMENTS EVEN ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THINGS. BUT WE SHOULD BE COMING FROM A PLACE OF LOVE, OF LOVING OUR COUNTRY AND OF RESPECTING ONE ANOTHER. AND WE HAVE TO REBUILD THIS FEELING IN OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. WE HAVE TOO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE. WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DESERVE A BETTER SHOT AT A FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. I WANT TO BE THEIR CHAMPION. AND WITH YOUR HELP I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY DOING THE BEST I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTRY WE LOVE IS THE COUNTRY WE DESERVE TO HAVE. THANK YOU ALL. [ APPLAUSE ] >> SO WE'RE GOING TO START INTRODUCING MADAM SECRETARY. [ ROOM NOISE ] >>",2015-11-07 17:43:39,2015-05-18,Mason City,Iowa
http://www.c-span.org/video/?325829-1/hillary-clinton-town-hall-immigration-nevada,Hillary Clinton Town Hall on Immigration in Nevada,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"NOW TO LAS VEGAS WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WILL SPEAK. THIS IS HER FIRST VISIT TO THE STATE AS A 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: HI, HOW ARE YOU? WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN NEVADA AND HERE AT RANCHO. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TALK WITH ME AND YOU ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND STORIES AND IN PARTICULAR, IMMIGRATION. I WANT TO OF KNOWLEDGE MIGHT -- ACKNOWLEDGE MY FRIEND AND CONGRESSWOMAN FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS CINCO DE MAYO, AN ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE DAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR HOSTING US TODAY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM EACH OF OUR PANEL PARTICIPANTS. I HAVE A LOT OF MEMORIES FROM MY TIME HERE IN NEVADA. I'VE GONE DOOR-TO-DOOR MEETING WITH FAMILIES NOT FAR FROM THIS SCHOOL. I'VE MET WITH A LOT OF CULINARY WORKERS WHO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING STRONG. I ACCOMPANIED A REGISTERED NURSE ON HER 12 HOUR SHIFT. I WAS VERY PLEASED TO GO BACK TO HER HOME AND HAVE DINNER WITH HER AND HER KIDS. AND I KNOW HOW HARD HIT NEVADANS WERE BY THE RECESSION. THIS STATE IN PARTICULAR SUFFERED SOME VERY TOUGH BLOWS. THERE WERE A MUCH HIGHER THAN AVERAGE HOME FORECLOSURE RATES, FOR EXAMPLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST TO THEIR HOURS WERE CUT, WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING. WE NOW SEE THAT THE STATE IS COMING BACK FROM THOSE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. FAMILIES HAVE FOUND WAYS TO MAKE IT WORK FOR THEM. WE ALSO SAW PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN STARTING BUSINESSES, THINKING ABOUT SENDING THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE. MAYBE DOING SOME HOME REPAIRS. PUTTING A LITTLE BIT ASIDE FOR RETIREMENT. WE ARE NOT YET BACK ON OUR FEET. WE HAVE CLIMBED OUT OF THE HOLE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE THAN JUST GET BY. WE HAVE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT TOGETHER. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE EVEN WITH ALL OF THE HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE SO MANY FAMILIES MADE, IN MANY WAYS, THE DECK IS STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP. I'M WELL AWARE IN LAS VEGAS THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN A STACKED DECK. [LAUGHTER] I WANT TO RESHUFFLE THE DECK. I WANT TO BE A CHAMPION FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. I WANT TO WORK ACROSS PARTY LINES. I WANT TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I WANT PEOPLE TO GET BACK TO THE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED AMERICAN STYLE OF PROBLEM SOLVING AND SETTING US ON THE RIGHT COURSE. TO HELP RESHUFFLE THE DECK, PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THEIR PART. THEY HAVE TO STEP UP AND TAKE EDUCATION SERIOUSLY. THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO WORK HARD BECAUSE NOTHING IS GIVEN TO YOU. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE WAS A REALLY SMALL BUSINESSMAN. JUST A FEW DAY WORKERS FROM TIME TO TIME. MY MOM, MY BROTHERS. HE UNDERSTOOD HARD WORK WAS THE PATH FORWARD IN THE UNITED STATES. HE MADE A GOOD LIVING FOR OUR FAMILY. I WILL FOREVER BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WHEN FAMILIES ARE STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG. I AM CONVINCED HAVING FOX FOR FAMILIES GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO MY YEARS IN LAW SCHOOL AND EVER SINCE, THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT. IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WE HAVE TO WAGE AND WIN FOUR BIG FIGHTS. ONE IS TO BUILD THE ECONOMY OF TOMORROW, NOT YESTERDAY. WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT IS GOING TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO START EARLY. EDUCATION IS THE KEY. EDUCATION IN THE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE IS ESSENTIAL. NOW WE KNOW THAT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT REALLY HAS FORMED BY THE TIME A CHILD IS THREE OR FOUR. WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD HAS THE BEST CHANCE TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL, TO GET AHEAD. TO CHARGE HIS OR HER OWN FUTURE. IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT WE STRENGTHEN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THAT'S MEANS WE HAVE TO ONCE AND FOR ALL FIX THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE. IT IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE, TOO. BUT IT IS A FAMILY ISSUE AT HEART. IF WE CLAIM WE ARE FOR FAMILIES, WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER AND RESOLVE THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES AROUND OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM . NOTCHES BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, AND IT IS, BUT BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT STRENGTHENS FAMILIES, STRENGTHENS OUR ECONOMY, AND OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER. WE CAN'T WAIT FOR A PATH TO EQUAL CITIZENSHIP. THIS IS WHERE I DIFFER WITH EVERYBODY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE . MAKE NO MISTAKE, NOT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE ANNOUNCED OR POTENTIAL IS CLEARLY SUPPORTING A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. NOT ONE. WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT LEGAL STATUS, THAT IS CODE FOR SECOND-CLASS STATUS. WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET WHO THIS DEBATE IS ABOUT. YOU ARE GOING TO MEET SOME OF THEM IN A MINUTE. PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD, WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY, WHO PAY TAXES TO IT AND WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO BUILD A GOOD FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE. THEY ARE DREAMERS IN MUCH MORE THAN NAME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE CAN LOOK AT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THINK WE SHOULD BREAK UP MORE FAMILIES, OR TURN AWAY MORE HARD WORKERS WITH TALENT TO HELP US BUILD THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO SEE. SO I WILL FIGHT FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR FAMILY ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. I WILL FIGHT TO STOP PARTISAN ATTACKS ON THE EXECUTIVE ACTION THAT WOULD PUT DREAMERS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH US TODAY, AT RISK OF DEPORTATION. AND IF CONGRESS CONTINUES TO REFUSE TO ACT, I WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE UNDER THE LAW TO GO EVEN FURTHER. THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE, LIKE MANY PARENTS HAVE DREAMERS, AND OTHERS, WITH DEEP TIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR COMMUNITIES, WHO DESERVE A CHANCE TO STAY AND I WILL FIGHT FOR THEM. THE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR SYMPATHETIC CASES TO BE REVIEWED. RIGHT NOW MOST OF THESE CASES HAVE NO WAY TO GET A REAL HEARING. THEREFORE WE SHOULD PUT IN PLACE A SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD, ACCESSIBLE WAY FOR PARENTS OF DREAMERS AND OTHERS WITH A HISTORY OF SERVICE AND CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR COMMUNITIES, TO MAKE THEIR CASE AND TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME DEFERRED ACTION AS THEIR CHILDREN. THAT IS JUST THE BEGINNING. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO DO TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE PROTECTIONS FOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO REFORM IMMIGRATION AND ENFORCEMENT, SO THEY ARE MORE HUMANE, TARGETED, AND EFFECTIVE. TO KEEP BUILDING THE PRESSURE FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. ON A PERSONAL BASIS, THE FIRST TIME I EVER MET ANYONE IN OUR COUNTRY WORKING WAS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 12 YEARS OLD, AS I RECALL. THROUGH MY CHURCH, I WAS RECRUITED, ALONG WITH SOME OTHER GIRLS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL, TO SERVE AS BABYSITTERS ON SATURDAY FOR THE SMALL CHILDREN SO THE OLDER CHILDREN COULD JOIN THEIR PARENTS IN THE FIELDS. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, IT WAS FARM FIELDS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE. THE MIGRANTS, IMMIGRANT LABORERS WOULD COME UP, UP THROUGH THE MIDWEST, CHICAGO, MICHIGAN. WE WERE ASKED TO TRY TO HELP OUT. I REMEMBER GOING TO THE CAMPS WHERE THE FAMILIES LIVED. TAKING CARE OF THE LITTLE KIDS, WHILE KIDS MY AGE WERE DOING HARD WORK. WHAT STUCK IN MY MIND WAS HOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WAS A LONG ROAD FROM THE CAMP THAT WENT OUT TO A DIRT ROAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. AND THE BUS THAT HAD THE WORKERS THAT CAME BACK AROUND 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, STOPPED AND LET OFF THE PARENTS AND THE OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS. ALL OF THESE KIDS STARTED RUNNING DOWN THE PATH TO SEE THEIR MOMS AND DADS AND THEIR BIG BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THEY WERE SCOOPED UP BY THESE REALLY TIRED PEOPLE. I JUST WATCHED THIS AND THOUGHT, THEY ARE JUST LIKE ME AND MY BROTHERS. WHEN MY DAD COMES HOME FROM WORK. WE GO OUT TO SEE HIM. AFTER HE HAS COME BACK FROM HIS DAY OF DOING WHAT HE HAD TO DO TO SUPPORT US. I'VE NEVER GOTTEN THAT EXPERIENCE OUT OF MY MIND. SO, FOR ME, THIS IS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WE ARE AND WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE HAVE. I AM CONVINCED IT IS IN OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST. IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF OUR VALUES. IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF OUR LONG-TERM SECURITY AS A NATION. SO YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND. THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN, AS PRESIDENT, AND IN THIS CAMPAIGN, TO MAKE THIS CASE. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH ME. I WANT THEM TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME. THE FACTS ARE REALLY CLEAR. WE KNOW HOW MUCH PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING HARD CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY. IN WHAT THEY BUY AND DO WHAT THEY PAY IN TAXES. IN NEW YORK, WHICH I KNOW ABOUT, OUR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS PAY MORE IN TAXES THAN SOME OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN NEW YORK. SO I'M READY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH ANYBODY, ANYWHERE, ANY TIME. LET ME TURN TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING THIS STORY. I WANT YOU TO MEET THEM AND HEAR FROM THEM. I'M GOING TO START WITH YOU, IF YOU WILL INTRODUCE YOURSELF, AND TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE AND WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THE TABLE TODAY. >> THANK YOU, SECRETARY. I'M A STUDENT AT THE NEVADA STATE COLLEGE PURSUING MY DEGREE IN HISTORY. I ARRIVED IN UNITED STATES WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. I CAME HERE WITH MY MOM AND DAD. I HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER HERE. HE IS A CITIZEN. OUR FAMILY WAS YOUNG. MY FATHER WAS GIVEN A DEPORTATION ORDER. MRS. CLINTON: BECAUSE YOU HIRED A LAWYER. >> HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THERE WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS IN THE 1990'S. PEOPLE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES. BECAUSE OF THAT, MY FATHER WAS GIVEN DEPORTATION ORDERS. THAT WAS NOT ACTED ON UNTIL 2011. WE DID NOT KNOW HE HAD THAT ORDER. RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE OF DISCRETION, MY DAD WILL QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM ONCE THE LAWSUIT IS MOVED OUT OF THE WAY. AND MY MOM WILL BE ABLE TO -- WE ARE NOT AFRAID SHE WILL BE DEPORTED. MRS. CLINTON: TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN SCHOOL. HOW YOU SEE YOUR FUTURE. THE CONTRIBUTIONS YOU HAVE MADE AS A YOUNG PERSON. WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO FURTHER. >> GROWING UP, I WAS DEDICATED TO SCHOOL. OUR PARENTS PUT A BIG EMPHASIS ON ME SUCCEEDING. BECAUSE OF ALL THE SACRIFICES THEY HAD MADE. THEY HAD NOT SEEN THEIR FAMILY AND 25 YEARS. WHEN I WENT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL, I WAS DEDICATED. IN SEVENTH GRADE, I WAS GLADIATOR OF THE YEAR BECAUSE I WAS THE STUDENT THAT SHOWED THE MOST CITIZENSHIP. [LAUGHTER] PROGRAMS LIKE THAT, I COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM BECAUSE WHEN I TURNED THE AGE OF GOING TO COLLEGE, I DID NOT HAVE A WAY OUT. I WAS AFRAID FOR MANY YEARS UNTIL FINALLY A COUNSELOR IN COLLEGE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND HELPED GUIDE ME AND I BECAME INVOLVED IN POLITICS. KNOWING THAT I DID NOT HAVE TO BE AFRAID BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING, AND THEY MEANT OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SAME SITUATION, WHICH HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. MRS. CLINTON: ERICA-- [APPLAUSE] THAT HIS MOM. PART OF OUR JOBS AS MOM'S TO EMBARRASS OUR CHILDREN AT ANY POSSIBLE MOMENT. ALSO WHEN WE ARE PROUD OF THEM. I'M HAPPY YOU ARE THERE. ERICA, HOW DID YOU END UP HERE TODAY? ERICA: I AM HERE TO SHARE MY STORY. I CAME HERE WHEN I WAS TWO YEARS OLD. MY PARENTS AND I MADE THE JOURNEY HERE AFTER WE LOST MY SISTER. THEY WANTED TO GIVE ME A BETTER FUTURE. I HAVE A 17-YEAR-OLD BROTHER. MY PARENTS WOULD QUALIFY IF THE LAWSUIT WAS LIFTED. I'M CURRENTLY GOING TO CFS. I WANT TO MAJOR IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY. I'M HERE WONDERING, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO HELP MY COMMUNITY AND MY FAMILY NOT TO LIVE IN FEAR ANYMORE? MRS. CLINTON: THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO CHANGE THE LAWS COMPREHENSIVELY. AS I HAVE SAID NUMEROUS TIMES, I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION IN THE FACE OF AN ACTION. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I WAS A SENATOR FOR EIGHT YEARS, WE HAD A FEW CHANCES TO TRY TO DO MORE FOR DREAMERS, FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, AND WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL. WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, I WAS GREAT PLEASED TO BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT IN THE SENATE FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. IT WAS SUCH A GOOD SIGNAL THAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN WORK TOGETHER, SOLVE A DIFFICULT PROBLEM. COULD PUT ASIDE PARTISAN DIFFERENCES. THE SENATE PASSED IT AND THE HOUSE WOULD NEVER TAKE IT UP. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE PASSED IF THEY HAD TAKEN IT UP. I THINK THE LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE DECIDED THAT POLITICALLY THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO REFORM. WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON IT. THAT IS WHY YOUR STORIES ARE IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE CAN'T LOOK AT IT AS THOUGH IT IS AN ABSTRACTION. IT IS REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES AND SONY PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS, WHO HAVE WORKED HARD, STARTED BUSINESSES, RAISED TO THEIR CHILDREN. AS YOU POINT OUT, YOU HAVE A BROTHER WHO IS A U.S. CITIZEN. WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE BLENDED FAMILIES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE DOCA AND ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED CONTINUE AND EVEN EXPAND. I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO DO MORE ON THE PARENTS OF DREAMERS WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDED. THE BEST WAY IS TO GET REFORM IN CONGRESS AND TRY TO RESOLVE ALL OF THIS. >> I'M 26 YEARS. I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE I WAS ONE EURO. I GRADUATED THIS SUMMER WITH A DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WHEN I WAS 15 YEARS OLD, MY PARENTS AND I RECEIVED ORDERS FOR DEPORTATION. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE LIVED IN FEAR. THANKFULLY, I HAVE SOME RELIEF BECAUSE OF DEFERRED ACTION. I CAN SAY THE SAME THING FOR MY PARENTS. UNLESS THE LAWSUIT IS DROPPED, MY PARENTS' FUTURE IS NOT SECURE. I STAND WITH THE 50,000 IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY WHO CAN FILE WITHIN THE ONE-YEAR DEADLINE FOR ASYLUM. SECRETARY CLINTON, WOULD YOU LIFT THE ONE-YEAR DEADLINE FOR ASYLUM-SEEKERS? MRS. CLINTON: THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT THAT QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER. I THINK PEOPLE IN THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE REPRESENTED. WE HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT, BUT NOT ENOUGH. I AM IN FAVOR, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, TO HAVE REPRESENTATION. I WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO HAVE IT. IF WE CAN PRIORITIZE, I WOULD LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE FROM VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, WHO WOULD NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. I DO NOT THINK THERE IS ANYTHING MAGIC ABOUT THE ONE-YEAR. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE MAKE OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM MORE HUMANE. I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT DETENTION FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE, AND FOUR CHILDREN. I THINK WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB IF WE PAID ATTENTION TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A RECORD OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THAT CATEGORY. I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD PUT CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE INTO THE FACILITY BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY ARE AT RISK. THERE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ARE AT RISK. THESE ARE ISSUES WE SHOULD GO AS FAR AS WE CAN TO GET THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND REPRESENTATION AND CHANGES SOME OF OUR DETENTION PROCESSES WITHIN THE KIND OF DISCRETION THE PRESIDENT HAS EXERCISED WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY TIMES A LOT OF THESE ISSUES CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL IF WE HAVE CHANGES IN THE LAW. I WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE. I WANT MORE HUMANE TREATMENT. NO MATTER HOW THE LAW IS WRITTEN OR ENFORCED. AND TO PUT THE RESOURCES BEHIND THAT AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR REFORM. >> THANK YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, FOR BEING HERE AND WELCOME TO NEVADA. I ARRIVED TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN I WAS SEVEN MONTHS OLD. NO THAT THE ONLY PLACE I CALL HOME. -- NEVADA IS THE ONLY PLACE I CALL HOME. I GRADUATED HERE, EDUCATION IS ONE OF OUR STRONG POINTS AS DREAMERS. BECAUSE OF IT, I'M LOOKING AT PURSUING A LAW DEGREE. AGAIN, THE SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION MESSES UP MY FAMILY. I COME FROM A MIXED STATUS FAMILY. MY SISTER IS A U.S. CITIZEN WHO PETITIONED TO CHANGED MY FATHER'S LEGAL STATUS. WE TRIED TO DO THE SAME FOR MY MOTHER. IT WAS EITHER MAKE THE DECISION TO HAVE HER SEPARATE OUR FAMILY OR KEEP OUR FAMILY TOGETHER. A STRONG MESSAGE IN THE IMMIGRATION FAMILY IS KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER, AND THAT IS THE PATH WE TOOK. SHE CONTINUES TO BE IN DOCUMENT. -- UNDOCUMENTED. SHE WILL QUALIFY, BUT WITH THE LAWSUIT, IT IS ANOTHER OBSTACLE IN THE WAY. MRS. CLINTON: COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT THE THREE AND 10 RULE IS? >> OF COURSE. FOR EXAMPLE, MY MOTHER AND I, WE ENTERED ILLEGALLY. MY FATHER ENTERED WITH A WORK PERMIT. HE ENTERED LEGALLY. WE FACED A 3-10 YEAR BAR BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE ENTERED. WE TOOK A DIFFERENT WAY COMPARED TO MY FATHER. BECAUSE OF IT, WE HAVE TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY, TRIED TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. WE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AS A PARDON FOR ENTERING ILLEGALLY. MRS. CLINTON: I THINK YOUR EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFICULTIES OF THESE RULES THAT ARE APPLIED TO EVERYBODY UNDER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE, LOOKING OUT TO THE UNDERLYING SITUATION. YOU HAVE A SISTER WHO IS A CITIZEN. A FATHER WHO IS A PERMANENT RESIDENT. YOU CAME HERE AT SEVEN MONTHS, YOU HAVE DONE WELL WITH YOUR EDUCATION, AND YOU ARE A COMMITTED YOUNG PERSON. AND YOUR MOTHER, WHO KEPT THE FAMILY GOING, WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PETITION FOR REENTRY AND THEREFORE BE DETERMINED AS LEGAL. THAT IS WAY I HAVE PROMOTED, EVER SINCE WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS DEBATE, GOING BACK TO WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM, SIMILAR TO WHAT THE SENATE PASSED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED AND WORKED HARD , YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY A FINE. WE WOULD WANT YOU TO LEARNING LIST. WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM BEFORE ANYBODY AROUND THIS TABLE. AND WE WOULD WANT YOU TO GET IN LINE TO GET A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. SO YOU WOULD NOT BE AT RISK OF BEING DEPORTED AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO COME BACK. I THINK THERE ARE, THERE IS AGREEMENT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THE BIPARTISAN BILL IN THE SENATE. SOME OF THEM ARE PAYING A POLITICAL PRICE FOR IT. IT IS STILL THE RIGHT THING. BECAUSE WE HAVE GAINED SO MUCH FROM PEOPLE, LIKE YOUR FAMILY, WHO HAVE COME HERE AND WORK CHART AND MADE A CONTRIBUTION. THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING THAT. IT SHOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS IN SO MANY FAMILIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. JUAN, YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING STORY. YOU ARE A ONE OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSMEN. THAT IS WHERE THE JOBS ARE CREATED. THAT IS WHERE THE ENGINE OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY COMES FROM. WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING? JUAN: MY NAME IS JUAN SALAZAR. I CAME HERE WHEN I WAS SEVEN. I GREW UP HERE. I'M UNDOCUMENTED. IT HIT ME WHEN I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS HARD TO FIND A JOB. MY FRIENDS WERE GETTING JOBS OR THEIR DRIVERS LICENSE. I GOT LEFT BEHIND. THANKS TO DACA, I WAS ABLE TO GET A WORK PERMIT. AS AN IMMIGRANT, I DID NOT TAKE NO OPPORTUNITY FOR GRANTED. RIGHT AWAY I WENT TO GO GET MY BUSINESS LICENSE. TO HAVE MY OWN POOL CLEANING COMPANY. WE STARTED OFF WITH THREE POOLS. I GOT MY BUSINESS LICENSE. I WENT TO GET CERTIFIED. MY NAME AND EVERYTHING. 2-3 LATER, WE HAVE OVER 50 POOL S, AND I MAKE SURE I WORK HARD. WE DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING WHEN MY DAD LOST HIS JOB. WE LOST OUR HOUSE. WE HAD TO SELL FOOD TO PAY THE PHONE BILL'S. IT WAS THE ONLY WAY UP FROM THERE. WE ARE WORKING HARD EVERY DAY. I'M LEARNING THROUGH THE STRUGGLES WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH, TAKING IT STEP-BY-STEP. MRS. CLINTON: I'M VERY PROUD TO HEAR YOUR STORY. LET'S FACE IT, YOU CAN CLEAN POOLS ALL YEAR ROUND IN NEVADA. WE HAVE A SHORTER SEASON WHERE I LIVE. [LAUGHTER] THE FACT YOU AND YOUR DAD REALLY WERE DETERMINED TO RECOVER FROM LOSING YOUR HOME, HIS JOB, DOING WHAT YOU HAD TO DO TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL FOR POSSIBLE, IS THE AMERICAN STORY. THAT IS WHAT IS SO MOVING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. JUAN: ONCE I GOT MY WORK PERMIT, I COULD NOT SAY THE SAME THING FOR MY PERMIT -- MY PARENTS. THEY DID NOT QUALIFIED. Y. I'M HAPPY FOR THE ONES WHO WERE ABLE TO. NOW THEY HAVE A SPEED BUMP. THEY'VE GOT TO SLOW DOWN NOW. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE MY PARENTS ARE PROTECTED. I WOULD NOT WISH THAT ON ANYBODY. HERE IN NEVADA, 21% OF THE BUSINESS ARE OWNED BY IMMIGRANTS. WE ARE MAKING, WE ARE MOVING UP AND WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. PROVIDING FOR OUR FAMILIES. WE ARE VERY UNITED. MRS. CLINTON: THAT IS GREAT. I THINK YOU HAVE PUT AN IMPORTANT STATISTIC, WHICH IS NATIONALLY, SO MANY OF THE NEW SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STARTED BY IMMIGRANTS. THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING, NOT TRYING TO PREVENT OR BREAKUP, BECAUSE OF STATUS DIFFERENCES. YOU ALSO HAVE THE FACT YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PARENTS. I WILL TRY TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO AVOID FAMILY BREAKUP, AVOID THE KIND OF TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE TO MANY FAMILIES HAVE GONE THROUGH, BECAUSE THEY WERE SPLIT UP. HALF OF THEIR FAMILY, OR THE BREADWINNER IS PICKED UP AND GONE ONE DAY. IT IS NOT SMART AND IT IS NOT RIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR STORY? >> I'M 16 YEARS OLD. I'M A JUNIOR. I ARRIVED IN THIS COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF 2. SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL. CURRENTLY I'M LOOKING TOWARD MY FUTURE. ONCE I BEGAN TO LOOKED AT WHAT I HAVE, THERE IS NOT A LOT OPEN. I CAN GO TO SCHOOL, BUT AFTERWARD, WHAT IS THERE FOR ME? I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR. I WANT TO GO TO YALE. MRS. CLINTON: I SHOULD BRAG ON YOU. YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST GRADE POINT AVERAGE IN THE WHOLE CLASS. RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] ONE OF YOUR COUNSELORS TOLD ME IT WAS 4.8. I DID NOT KNOW IT WENT THAT TIE. YOU ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF STUDENT THAT EVERY FAMILY, EVERY COMMUNITY SHOULD BE PROUD OF. THE IDEA YOU WANT TO BE A DOCTOR IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING AND TRYING TO CLEAR THE PATH SO YOU CAN GO ON AND DO THAT. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY? >> MY PARENTS ARRIVED AS UNDOCUMENTED. THEY WERE BOTH DEPENDING ON DACA. MY DAD WANTS TO OPEN HIS OWN MECHANIC SHOP. WITH THAT, HE WOULD BE ABLE TO EXPAND HIS BUSINESS. HOWEVER, HE REALLY CAN'T. MRS. CLINTON: I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT FACES BEHIND THE STORIES. SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE MENTIONED HOW THE LAWSUIT TRIED TO PREVENT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. HOW THAT HAS STOPPED PLANS FOR NEW BUSINESSES, FOR GOING TO SCHOOL, WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO WHEN YOU GRADUATE. CREATING MORE AND CERTAINTY. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING WITH RESPECT TO YOUR FATHER. I THINK THAT CERTAINTY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. PREDICTABILITY. REGULARIZATION, IF YOU WILL. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IT IS UNREALISTIC AND, I THINK, FOOLISH TO CONTINUE TO TALK AS THOUGH WE ARE GOING TO DEPORT 11 MILLION OR 12 MILLION PEOPLE. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WHEN YOU ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, RIGHT? I ONCE CALCULATED WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE HOW MUCH MONEY IT WOULD COST, HOW MANY BUSES WOULD BE REQUIRED. IT IS BEYOND ABSURD. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS ACCEPT THE FACT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. IT WAS FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WHO MIGHT HAVE SAID WE STARTED OFF AS A NATION OF REVOLUTIONARIES AND IMMIGRANTS. THAT HAS CONTINUED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE ISSUES THAT ARE AROUND THIS SITUATION WE ARE FACED WITH. THE FACTS ARE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS, THE ECONOMIC CONSUMER CONTRIBUTIONS, THE PAYING OF TAXES, AND THEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD AND ARE LOOKING FOR A PLACE IN SOCIETY. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. NOW IS YOUR CHANCE TO MAYBE SAY WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE AND HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE SO THAT WE HAVE A DEBATE THAT IS ABOUT THE REALITIES, NOT ABOUT THE TALKING POINTS AND THE ARGUMENTS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO START? >> ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS FAMILY UNIFICATION. 11 MILLION PEOPLE COULD NOT BE DEPORTED. MILLIONS HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. WE HAVE VICTORIA HERE. SHE IS ALSO A TRIMMER. SHE HAS NOT SEEN HER MOTHER IN FOUR YEARS. THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO MEXICO FOR AN EMERGENCY. HER MOTHER WAS UNFORTUNATELY, BROKE HER LEG ON THE JOURNEY BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. VICTORIA CAME HERE ALONE. SHE HAS BEEN WITH A GUARDIAN. TO ME, ONE QUESTION, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THOSE FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED? I GO TO BED EVERY NIGHT. I LIVE IN THE FEAR MY PARENTS WILL BE DEPORTED, BUT THEY ARE STILL HERE. I CAN TALK TO THEM. ALL OF OUR STORIES HAVE VERY COMPLEX ISSUES. JUAN WORKING. HIS FAMILY'S STATUS. WE HAVE SIBLINGS. OUR PARENTS WOULD QUALIFY FOR ADJUSTMENT. MY QUESTION IS A LITTLE BIT EXPANDING ON SEVERAL OF THOSE ISSUES. MRS. CLINTON: UNIFICATION SHOULD BE ONE OF OUR GOALS IN COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. BECAUSE WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEAL WITH THIS CHALLENGE FOR YEARS NOW AND IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUALLY FINALLY PASSING REFORM, A LOT OF FAMILIES HAVE BEEN BROKEN UP. THAT IS REALLY SO PAINFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE THROUGH IT, AND EVEN THOSE ON THE OUTSIDE TO EVEN IMAGINE WHAT THAT MUST BE LIKE. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS. I THINK THEY WERE WITHIN HIS AUTHORITY, CONSTITUTIONALLY, LEGALLY, THEY WERE BASED ON PRECEDENT THAT I BELIEVE IS ADEQUATE. AND STILL TRY TO GO FURTHER, LIKE THE UNIFICATION OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SPLIT UP. YES. >> 276,000 UNDOCUMENTED LGBT IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF THEM ARE TRANS. AS A LESBIAN WOMAN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW WE CAN PROTECT OUR TRANS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHERE THEY DO NOT IDENTIFY WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY? MRS. CLINTON: I THINK WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENTS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THAT CERTAINLY INCLUDES LGBT COMMUNITY, CHILDREN, AND UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. THERE ARE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO WE DESERVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE, BECAUSE OF THE SITUATIONS THEY ARE FINDING THEMSELVES IN. I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO REFORM OUR DETENTION SYSTEM. I'M NOT SURE A LOT OF AMERICANS KNOW A LOT OF THE DETENTION FACILITIES FOR IMMIGRANTS ARE RUN BY PRIVATE COMPANIES. THEY HAVE A BUILT IN INCENTIVE TO FILL THEM UP. THERE IS ACTUALLY A LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT SO MANY BEDS BE FILLED. SO PEOPLE GO OUT AND ROUND UP PEOPLE IN ORDER TO GET PAID ON A PER DAY BASIS. THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE RUNNING ANY DETENTION FACILITY. THERE IS A LOT WE HAVE TO DO TO CHANGE WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING AND TRIED TO PUT US ON A PATH TOWARD A BETTER, HUMANE SYSTEM FOR EVERYBODY. >> I THINK AFFORDABILITY IS A MAJOR FACTOR. MANY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED. MY PARENTS WORKED FOR TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT WAS IN 1990. I ALSO THINK MANY OF OUR PARENTS HAVE HAD A WORKING JOB. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO ROUTE THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE DESERVE TO MAKE A LIVING WAGE. MRS. CLINTON: I AGREE WITH THAT COMPLETELY, AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. DAVE AND SOME CITIES ARE ON THEIR OWN RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. THERE NEEDS TO BE A FEDERAL CORE. I BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO DO THAT THIS WEEK. I AGREE WITH YOU. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, AS YOU MENTIONED, YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, BUT AS OF NOW YOU MENTIONED YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH CONGRESS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO A DAY WHERE WE BECOME CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. ALL OF US HAVE KNOCKED DOORS TO GET VOTERS OUT AND WE TELL THEM OUR STORIES, BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT, THEY ARE NOT ONLY VOTING FOR THEMSELVES, THEY ARE VOTING FOR US AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. IF AND WHEN ELECTED, DO YOU PLAN TO PUSH CONGRESS AS YOUR FIRST INITIATIVE, TO PUSH FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM? MRS. CLINTON: IT WILL BE AMONG MY FIRST INITIATIVE'S. I CAN'T PREDICT WHAT WILL BE HAPPENING. THAT HAPPENED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE WAS ELECTED AND FOUND OUT WE WERE FALLING INTO AN ECONOMIC ABYSS. HE DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR RE-STABILIZING THE SITUATION AND GETTING US BACK ON THE ECONOMIC UPSWING. AMONG THE PRIORITIES I WOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR IN THE BEGINNING WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT, AS SECRETARY OF STATE, I SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO COUNTRIES THAT ESTABLISHED A SECOND-CLASS STATUS FOR PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT FEEL THEY BELONG, OR THEY HAVE ANY ALLEGIANCE TO THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY LIVE AND WORK. THEY ARE NEVER FULLY ACCEPTED. THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DIVISIVE NESTS -- DIVISIVENESS AND DISINTEGRATION. MY VIEW IS THAT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. WE HAVE ASSIMILATED TENS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OVER THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY. WE HAVE 11, 12 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM HAVE PROVEN THEY WANT TO BE A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY AND WE SHOULD PUT THEM ON THAT PATH. THOSE WHO SAY WE CAN DO REFORM, BUT NOT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP, WOULD BE UNDERMINING WHAT HAS MADE AMERICA A UNIQUE. THE WAY WE HAVE ASSIMILATED PEOPLE. THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL LOYAL, THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MAKE. THIS IS NOT JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR AMERICA, IF YOU COMPARE US TO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DID NOT TAKE THAT STEP, YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT HAS DONE TO THEM. I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE. I SUPPORT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP IN THE CONSTEXT OF IMMIGRATION REFORM. JUAN: I WANTED TO ADD A PERSONAL STORY. WHEN I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, I COULD NOT FIND ANY WORK. MY DAD WAS NOT WORKING AS WELL. WE FOUND A LANDSCAPING JOB. DOING LABOR FOR A COMPANY. WE WERE GETTING PAID SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR. THEY WOULD WORK US EXCESSIVELY. I WAS YOUNG. WORKING REALLY HARD. IT'S GOT TO A POINT WHERE I REMEMBER WE COULD NOT LOOK AT THE BOSS IN THE EYE. EVEN IF IT WAS LUNCHTIME, YOU HAD TO WORK. A LOT OF STORIES LIKE THAT. OTHER STORIES WITH STUFF LIKE THAT. IT IS REALLY HARD. ME AND MY DAD WORKED REALLY HARD. WHEN HE WOULD GET HOME FROM WORK, AND I WOULD SEE HIM LIMPING, THAT IS WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO DO SOMETHING FOR US. HE RAISED ME TO RESPECT EVERYONE AND TO BE HONEST AND SUPPORTED ME WITH SCHOOL. JUST LOOKING OUT FOR HIM. I'M REALLY GLAD HE IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER. MRS. CLINTON: I BET HE WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU. YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT. IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE AND DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU. OFTEN TIMES IT IS ABOUT CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE FEARFUL ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM. THEIR FEARS ARE ROOTED IN THE FEELING THEY ARE LOSING JOBS. THEY ARE GOING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. PART OF THAT FEAR HAS A REALITY TO IT BECAUSE PEOPLE PAY YOU SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR, BECAUSE YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED. WHY WOULD THEY PAY SOMEBODY WHO IS A CITIZEN WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE? I ARGUMENT IS TO PUT -- THE BETTER THE JOB MARKET WILL BE FOR EVERYBODY. YOU WILL NOT HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND YOU DO NOT HAVE OTHERS WHO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE LOSING JOBS BECAUSE THIS GROUP IS BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND THEY ARE PAID LESS AND TREATED WORSE. MY ARGUMENT TO PEOPLE WHO WORRY ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE REFORM AND THE EFFECT ON THEIR JOB IS, IT IS THE OPPOSITE. THE SOONER WE CAN GET TO LEGALIZATION, THE BETTER THE JOB MARKET WILL BE FOR EVERYBODY. EMPLOYERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VIOLATE THE LAWS. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DEALING WITH A WORKFORCE THAT IS SCARED TO SAY ANYTHING, OR EVEN SCARED TO LOOK AT THE BOSS WHEN HE SHOWS UP. THIS IS ABOUT EVERYBODY. NOT JUST YOU AND YOUR DAD. JUAN: ONE MORE QUESTION. I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I KNOW HERE IN NEVADA, EDUCATION, WE KEEP ON LOWERING THE EDUCATION. A LOT OF KIDS AREN'T GRADUATING. WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO THESE KIDS AND SHOW THEM THAT SCHOOL IS VERY IMPORTANT AND SO IS HIGHER EDUCATION. MAYBE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER WAY. A LOT OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF FUNDING. THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. SO THEY DECIDE NOT TO GO TO SCHOOL. MRS. CLINTON: THAT IS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WHETHER IT IS COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR COLLEGE OR A JOB TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WILL GIVE THEM A GOOD START. AND MAKE -- YOU MAKE A STRONG POINT. IT IS SO EXPENSIVE TO CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION THAT TOO MANY KIDS ARE FEELING AND THEIR PARENTS ARE FEELING IT IS THE ON THEIR REACH. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PROPOSAL FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH AT LEAST GET YOU STARTED AND I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK TO SEE HOW WE GET THE DEBT UNDER CONTROL AND GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO NOT BE BURDENED BY DEBT WHICH MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO START A BUSINESS OR TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF MY EDUCATION POLICY AS I GO FORWARD WITH THE CAMPAIGN. YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. TOO MANY PEOPLE FEEL IT IS OUT OF THEIR REACH OR THEY GRADUATE WITH SOME MUCH DEBT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE PARALYZED. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEY CANNOT BUY A HOUSE, THEY CANNOT GET MARRIED, THEY CANNOT START A BUSINESS BECAUSE THE OH SO MUCH IN STUDENT DEBT. -- THEY OWE SO MUCH IN STUDENT DEBT. THE AVERAGE STUDENT IN IOWA GRADUATES WITH THOUSANDS DOLLARS OF DEBT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THAT MUCH ASSETS AND INCOME SO IT IS RELATIVE TO WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD. I LEARNED TODAY THAT THIS SCHOOL USES TITLE I FUNDS TO PAY FOR THE AP EXAM FEE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR MORE STUDENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES REALLY UPSET LEVEL OF EDUCATION. IT GIVES KIDS A LEG UP BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE SOME CREDIT BEFORE THEY EVER GET THERE BUT TOO MANY KIDS IN THE PAST AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY DO NOT TAKE THE TEST BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT DOES TODAY. $80? 85. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY IF YOU'RE ARE MAKING MINIMUM WAGE OR LESS. I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATORS ARE STILL HERE. I WANT TO GIVE THEM A BIG SHOUT OUT FOR USING TITLE ROOM AND ONE -- TITLE I AM SURE YOU WILL DO SOME OF THAT NEXT YEAR. OR CURRENTLY. YOU HAVE THEM TOMORROW? >> THAT IS MONDAY AND STATISTICS AND ENGLISH NEXT WEDNESDAY. MRS. CLINTON: WOW. >> ONCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED, IT OPENED MANY DOORS. OFTENTIMES THE JOURNEY ENDS THERE AND I WAS WONDERING IF OR WHAT WAS YOUR POSITION OR WHAT WILL YOU OFFER IN ORDER FOR US TO CONTINUE OUR EDUCATION. MRS. CLINTON: IT IS VERY SHORTSIGHTED OF US NOT TO LEGALIZE STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE AND CAN USE THEIR SKILLS TO MAKE A GOOD LIFE FOR THEMSELVES BUT ALSO TO GIVE BACK. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN STUDENTS COME TO OUR COUNTRY EVERY YEAR. THEY GET A GREAT EDUCATION IN OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND A LOT OF THEM STAY. I WANT YOU TO BE A DOCTOR IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO BE. YOU HAVE, TO OUR SYSTEM, YOU HAVE WORKED HARD, YOU HAVE DONE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. I THINK THIS IS THE PARTICULAR FIX IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER FIXES WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. I READ AN ARTICLE RECENTLY ABOUT A GROUP OF YOUNG, UNDOCUMENTED MEN WHO WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE ENTERED A CONTEST AGAINST KIDS FROM THE BEST SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES AND THEY WON. SO YOU HAVE FOUR KIDS WHO BEAT THE BEST OF THE BEST AND THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY WERE UNDOCUMENTED. I'M SITTING THERE THINKING, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE? WE ARE IN A GLOBAL OPPOSITION AND I INTEND FOR US TO WIN IT AND I'M ABOUT -- NOT ABOUT TO LET ANYONE WHO CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY GET THROWN AWAY. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO FIX THAT, WE NEED TO REMOVE THE FEAR, AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE EVERY CHILD A CHANCE TO DO THE BEST THAT HE OR SHE CAN. IF THAT MEANS GOING TO YALE AND BECOMING A DOCTOR -- [INAUDIBLE] [APPLAUSE] AS YOU CAN TELL, I COULD BE HERE ALL DAY. WE HAVE SIX EXCEPTIONAL YOUNG PEOPLE, WE HAVE SOME PROUD PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND TEACHERS HERE. BUT LET ME AND WHERE I STARTED. THINKING RANCHO FOR HAVING ME HERE, THINKING EACH OF YOU FOR BEING WILLING AND BRAVE ENOUGH TO SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN LIVES. I WANT TO REITERATE MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ACTION BECAUSE HE HAD TO ACT IN THE FACE OF INACTION THAT WAS NOT ON THE MERITS BUT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. FOR PARTISAN REASONS WHICH I THINK IS NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY. IN OUR CONGRESS OR ANYWHERE ELSE. I AM SO PLEASED THAT THE CONGRESSWOMAN IS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE IS A CHAMPION FOR A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I WANT TO GET BACK TO GOOD OLD-FASHIONED PROBLEM-SOLVING AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO SOLVE TOGETHER SO I PLEDGE TO YOU I WILL DO EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE THIS AN ISSUE IN THE CAMPAIGN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, TO PUT IT ON THE TOP OF MY PRIORITY LIST. YOU STAY HERE. WE WILL GET THE PRINCIPAL AND OTHERS TO COME UP AND JOIN US. LET'S GET THE ADMINISTRATORS WHO INVITED US ALL HERE TO COME AND STAND. IF YOU WILL STAND WITH US WE WILL GET A PICTURE WITH EVERYBODY. WHY DO YOU JOIN US? -- WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US? WRITE ME A MEMO ON WHAT I NEED TO DO DIFFERENTLY. [LAUGHTER] YOU WANT TO COME AROUND? WE ALL STAND UP. THAT IS GOOD. EXCELLENT. OK, COME CLOSER. AND JUAN, GIVE ME THAT. THAT'S GREAT. OK, LOOK AT BARB AND WE WILL LOOK AT ALL THE PROUD PARENTS WITH THEIR CAMERAS. OK,'S A LOOK OVER HERE. -- SO LOOK OVER HERE. OK, GOT SOME CAMERAS OVER HERE. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU ARE ON THE RED CARPET. LOOK HERE. OK. THANK YOU. YOU WANT TO COME AROUND? I AM SO HAPPY I COULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> I AM GRATEFUL. MRS. CLINTON: IS YOUR NAME BARBARA? >> BARB. [INAUDIBLE] I LOVE THAT. GREAT. THANK YOU. >> ONE LAST THING. MRS. CLINTON: YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE CAMPAIGN STARTING WITH WHAT I DID TODAY. THANK YOU.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?326259-1/hillary-clinton-remarks-columbia-south-carolina,"Hillary Clinton Remarks in Columbia, South Carolina",Hillary Rodham Clinton,"SPEAKING TO A GROUP GATHERED IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, LIVE COVERAGE HERE ON C-SPAN. >> THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. TODAY WE ARE MAKING HISTORY. TODAY IS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS ATTENDED ANY DAY IN BLUE PROCEEDINGS. I'M SO THANKFUL THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON AND THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS DAY POSSIBLE. THIS DAY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A FABULOUS GREAT YEAR FOR SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC WOMEN. NEXT YEAR WE CULMINATE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, SOUTH CAROLINA, A DEEP SOUTH STATE, IS HOSTING A FEDERATION OF DEMOCRATIC OF WOMEN'S CONVENTION, YES, RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'RE BRINGING IT TO YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW PROUD I AM THAT I'M IN THE ROOM WITH A DUNK OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACTIVISTS, WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE COME ALL OVER THE STATE FOR THIS DAY IN BLUE. MANY OF YOU REGISTERED BEFORE THIS EVENT BEFORE OUR SPEAKER TODAY. I THINK YOU ALL SUSPECTED A COUPLE OF THINGS, BUT I'M SO PROUD TO BE HERE WITH YOU TO STAND BEFORE YOU AND MY PARTNER IN CRIME IN THE DAY IN BLUE IS REPRESENTATIVE GUILDA COBB-HUNTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> GILDA COBB-HUNTER REPRESENTS US AND TAKES CARE OF US ALL AROUND. BOSSES US AROUND AND TAKES CARE OF US. I AM SO PROUD AND HONORED TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND GILDA COBB-HUNTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, SUSEAN. THOSE OF YOU THAT KNOW ME KNOW I START BY SAYING HEY, Y'ALL. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE HERE. LET'S GIVE SUSAN AND THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL PARTNERING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN THIS YEAR'S EVENT. WE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED TO HAVE COLLEAGUES COME TOGETHER FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE TO ENGAGE AND EMPOWER OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD LOUD AND PROUD. AS ALL Y'ALL KNOW, THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF WOMEN IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE WOMAN REPUBLICAN IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA SENATE. THAT MUST CHANGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT THE DIFFERENCE THAT CHANGE IN THE FACES OF OUR GENERAL ASSEMBLY CAN MAKE. WOMEN BRING A UNIQUE AND NECESSARY PERSPECTIVE AND IN OFFICE WILL FIGHT FOR THINGS THAT MATTER TO FAMILIES AND ALL PEOPLE. WE ARE GATHERED TODAY FOR OUR ANNUAL DAY IN BLUE BECAUSE ALL OF US HERE BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE HOUSE AND IN THE SENATE AND ALSO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> IN CASE THERE IS ANY DOUBT, ALSO AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> SPEAKING OF DRA ADDRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE, AS YOU KNOW, SOUTH CAROLINA IS PROUD TO HOST THE FIRST IN THE SOUTH DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AND WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST HERE TODAY. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HER. FOR US SOUTHERNERS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS DEEP SOUTHERN ROOTS WHERE IN ARKANSAS SHE IS STILL CONSIDERED A SPECIAL FAVORITE DAUGHTER. SHE SERVED OR AS I SHOULD SAY, SHE IS STILL CONSIDERED A HOMETOWN GIRL. SHE SERVED AS OUR FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR OF NEW YORK AND SECRETARY OF STATE AND NO MATTER WHERE SHE SERVED, SHE HAS BEEN A TIRELESS CHAMPION FOR WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES. SOUTH CAROLINA, JOIN ME IN WELCOMING HILLARY CLINTON TO THE PALMETTO STATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: WELL, THIS IS SO EXCITING, TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND TO BE HERE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT CAUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL RECRUITS AND TRAINS AND FIELDS MORE WOMEN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: THERE ARE A LOT OF LONG-TIME FRIENDS HERE. I WON'T TRY TO MENTION EVERYBODY, BUT I DO WANT TO THANK SUSAN AND THE ENTIRE BOARD FOR D.W.C. I WANT TO THANK GILDA WHO I THINK HAS BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SINCE 1992, STARTED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND WORKED HER WAY UP. FORMER GOVERNOR JIM HODGES, WE'RE DELIGHTED HE IS HERE, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: A NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CHAIR, A STATE DEMOCRATIC CHAIR, OF COURSE, DON AND CAROL FOWLER, SO HAPPY TO SEE THEM. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: YOUR CANDIDATE FOR THE SENATE LAST TIME, JOYCE DICKERSON. THANK YOU, JOYCE. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: I WAS THINKING ON THE WAY DOWN HERE THAT I FIRST CAME TO SOUTH CAROLINA AS A YOUNG LAWYER WORKING FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND STARTED BY YOUR OWN SOUTH CAROLINA NATIVE MARION WRIGHT EDELMAN FROM BENNETTSVILLE. I CAME BACK MANY TIMES TO RENAISSANCE WEEKEND, GOING TO HILTON HEAD AND THEN TO CHARLESTON. MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS AND HAD A LOT OF GOOD TIME AND AM THRILLED TO BE BACK. I'M BACK BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORT YOU. YOU KNOW THE THEME OF THIS DAY OF EVENTS IS HOW DO BUILD A PARTY AND HOW TO BUILD A PARTY THAT REALLY RESPECTS AND INCLUDES WOMEN AND GIVES WOMEN IN THIS STATE A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY BE AT THE TABLE, BUT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE. CARRYING WITH THEM THEIR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES AND YOU'RE RIGHT, I AM RUNNING TO LIVE AGAIN AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE ALL BY MYSELF. I WANT DEMOCRATS ELECTED FROM THE LOCAL TO THE COUNTY TO THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL ONCE AGAIN MAKING THE CASE THAT WHEN DEMOCRATS WIN, AMERICANS WIN. AND SO I WANT TO SAY JUST A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED FUNDAMENTALLY THAT WHEN FAMILIES ARE STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG. WE HAVE COME THROUGH SOME REALLY TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. I LOOKED AT THE STATISTICS AND SOUTH CAROLINA HAS PULLED ITSELFEN AS OTHER PLACES HAVE AS WELL, AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE MADE A LOT OF SACRIFICES. PEOPLE LOST JOBS. PEOPLE LOST HOMES. PEOPLE HAD TO PUT COLLEGE ON THE BACK BURNER, RETIREMENT ON THE BACK BURNER, BUT EVERYBODY JUST KEPT GOING. IT TOOK A LOT OF DETERMINATION. ACROSS AMERICA WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE RESULTS OF ALL OF THAT HARD WORK. AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A PATTERN. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS AND THERE ARE TWO IN PARTICULAR I'M THINKING ABOUT OVER THE LAST 35 YEARS SEEM TO INHERIT A MESS OF PROBLEMS. HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT? SO THEN THEY HAVE TO DIG US OUT OF THE DITCHES THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN AND PUT US BACK ON THE RIGHT ATTACK. OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT LITTLE CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: BUT, OF COURSE, PRESIDENTS DON'T DO IT ALONE. THEY DO IT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S A PARTNERSHIP. TODAY WE ARE STANDING UP AGAIN, BUT WE'RE NOT YET RUNNING AND WE FACE A CHOICE. ARE WE GOING TO HAND OVER OUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN TO THE PEOPLE AND POLICIES THAT CRASHED OUR ECONOMY BEFORE AND THAT WILL SHRED THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT ANSWER. [LAUGHTER] SEC. CLINTON: BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE ABOUT, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAND UP TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KEEP THE DECK STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUCCESS OF OUR COUNTRY IS SHARED ACROSS THE ECONOMY AND THAT MORE FAMILIES HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD, NOT JUST TO GET BY, BUT TO STAY MOVING FORWARD WITH THE KIND OF CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM THAT HAS ALWAYS MARKED THE BEST TIMES IN AMERICA. YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE WORDS ""MIDDLE CLASS"" MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN. THEY SHOULD REPRESENT A SOLEMN PROMISE, THAT ANYONE WILLING TO WORK HARD CAN EARN A DECENT LIVING AND A BETTER LIFE, NOT JUST GET BY PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THAT'S THE MIDDLE CLASS I GREW UP IN. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN, WHEN I SAY SMALL, IT WAS SMALL. HE RAN A SMALL DRAPERY PRINTING BUSINESS. AND HE LITERALLY HAD A PRINT PLANT WITH BIG LONG TABLES THAT HAD SILK SCREENS AND SOMETIMES MY MOTHER, MY BROTHERS AND I WOULD HELP TO POUR THE PAINT IN AND TAKE THE SQUEEGEE AND THEN WE WOULD CAULK DOWN THE TABLE AND PRINT THE FABRICS. THEN HE WOULD GO OUT AND SELL THEM. IT WAS A GOOD DECENT MIDDLE CLASS LIFE THAT HE PROVIDED TO MY BROTHERS AND ME. AND I AM SO GRATEFUL AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND. IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT SO MANY OF US BELIEVED WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP AND THE FUTURE SEEMED UNLIMITED. OF COURSE, WE HAD TO FIX A LOT OF THINGS IF THE COUNTRY STARTING WITH CIVIL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE OPPORTUNITY LADDER ALWAYS WAS HELD OUT THERE. I JUST CAME FROM KIKI'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I WAS MEETING WITH A GROUP OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS WILMINGTON AND THEY WERE TELLING ME -- BUSINESSWOMEN AND THEY WERE TELLING ME WHAT THEY NEEDED TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE. IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CONVERSATION I REMEMBER AROUND MY DINNER TABLE. THAT'S WHAT LINKS US TOGETHER, PAST ALL OF THE OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT SOMETIMES DIVIDE US. BEING MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA MEANS THAT YOU FEEL IN CONTROL OF YOUR FINANCIAL DESTINY. IT SHOULD MEAN THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE SO YOU CAN WORRY A LITTLE LESS. IT SHOULD MEAN THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN YOUR FUTURE AND THE FUTURE OF YOUR CHILDREN, PUTTING ASIDE SOME FOR EDUCATION, PUTTING ASIDE SOME FOR RETIREMENT. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THAT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE WORKED FOR WON'T BE LOST IN A FLASH BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE OR FAILED TO BE MADE IN WASHINGTON. AND SO, THEREFORE -- [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: -- I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO MAKES CORPORATIONS LIVE UP TO THEIR BASIC GUARANTEE THAT WHEN WORKERS HELP PRODUCE RECORD PROFITS, THOSE WORKERS SHOULD GET A REAL SHARE OF THE REWARDS INSTEAD OF IT ALL GOING TO THOSE AT THE TOP. YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS. SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN TOP C.E.O.'S LEARN 300 TIMES MORE THAN THE TYPICAL AMERICAN WORKER. OR HERE IS MY LATEST LEAST FAVORITE STATISTIC, THE 25 BIGGEST HEDGE FUND MANAGERS EARN MORE THAN ALL THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN AMERICA COMBINED. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR VALUES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PREPARING OUR CHILDREN THROUGH EDUCATION TO MAKE IT IN A VERY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. TODAY TOO MANY POLITICIANS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO THE SAME FAILED TOP-DOWN ECONOMICS ARE MOUTHING THE WORDS ""MIDDLE CLASS."" BUT THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN AND SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO FIGHT FOR. IF THOSE WORDS ARE GOING TO HAVE MEANING AGAIN, THEY HAVE GOT TO BE BACKED UP BY REAL SOLUTIONS, NOT EMPTY RHETORIC. AND THOSE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE WAYS THAT THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED. TODAY 40% OF MOTHERS ARE THE SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNERS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. PARENTS ARE RUBBING HOME FROM WORK TO GET THEIR KIDS HOME FROM SCHOOL AND MAYBE GET THEM OFF TO A PRACTICE OR A REHEARSAL, THEY'RE SQUEEZING EVERY MINUTE OUT OF THEIR 24-HOUR DAY WITH BARELY ENOUGH TIME TO BREATHE LET ALONE RELAX. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A PRACTICING LAWYER BACK IN LITTLE ROCK AND AROUND 3:00 EVERY AFTERNOON, ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO WORKED IN THE FIRM WERE HUNCHED OVER THEIR PHONES KIND OF WHISPERING INTO THEM. AT FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN I REALIZED THEY WERE ALL CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THEIR CHILDREN GOT HOME SAFELY. MANY PEOPLE TODAY CAN'T COUNT ON RELATIVES TO PITCH IN BECAUSE SO MANY FAMILIES ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NOW, I HAPPEN TO BE EXTREMELY LUCKY BECAUSE MY AMAZING 8-MONTH-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LIVES NEAR ME SO I GET TO SEE HER A LOT, BUT NOBODY EXPECTS EVERYTHING TO COME EASY. THAT IS NOT PART OF LIFE, WE KNOW THAT. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE QUITE SO HARD TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD IN AMERICA. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES NEED A CHAMPION, A CHAMPION WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY, NOT FOR SOME AMERICANS, BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS AND I WANT TO BE THAT CHAMPION. I WANT TO GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY GOING TO WORK FOR YOU, STANDING UP FOR YOU, MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: TAKE THE ISSUE OF EQUAL PAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: I DON'T THINK I'M LETTING YOU IN ON A SECRET WHEN I SAY TOO MANY WOMEN STILL EARN LESS THAN MEN ON THE JOB. AND WOMEN OF COLOR OFTEN MAKE EVEN LESS AND THEN THERE IS THE SO-CALLED MOTHERHOOD PENALTY WITH MANY WOMEN TAKING A PAY CUT WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN. ALL OF THIS LOST MONEY ADDS UP. FOR MANY FAMILIES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. THAT'S MEDICINE THAT CAN GO FOR RENT OR GROCERIES OR A NEW CAR OR INTO THE COLLEGE FUND. NOW, WE COULD FIX THIS IF REPUBLICANS WOULD GET ONBOARD. WE IN FACT COULD FIX THIS TODAY, BUT THEY WON'T. IN FACT, ONE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT DISMISSED EQUAL PAY AS A ""BOGUS"" ISSUE. ANOTHER SAID CONGRESS WAS ""WASTING TIME WORRYING ABOUT IT."" ONE EVEN SAID THAT ""EFFORTS TO GUARANTEE FAIR PAY REMINDED HIM OF THE SOVIET UNION."" AND TO THAT I SAY, WHAT CENTURY ARE THEY LIVING IN? BUT THANKFULLY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN ANY PARENT IS SHORT CHANGED, THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS SHORT CHANGED. WHEN FAMILIES ARE SHORT CHANGED, AMERICA IS SHORT CHANGED AND THEREFORE THIS IS NOT A WOMEN'S ISSUE, THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE AND AN AMERICAN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND HERE IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO INSTEAD TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP. FIRST WE [APPLAUSE] GET THE BEST GIVES WOMEN THE LEGAL TOOLS WE NEED TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION AT WORK. I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION BACK IN THE SENATE IN 2007 AND CAP SPONSORING IT AGAIN AND A 10. WELL, IT IS TIME TO GET THIS ON ONCE AND FOR ALL. SECOND, WE SHOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY ACROSS SO THAT WOMEN HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO NEGOTIATE FAIRLY. YOU CANNOT STAND UP FOR EVEN OK IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE PAID EQUALLY. YOU REMEMBER THE LILY LEDBETTER CASE, SHE DID NOT KNOW FOR THE LONGEST TIME THAT SHE WAS NOT PAID AS MUCH AS HER MALE COWORKERS DOING THE SAME JOB. POSTING FOR JOBS SHOULD COME WITH SALARY RANGES, AND LARGE COMPANIES SHOULD REPORT ON HOW FAILING OR NOT THEY ARE CONFERENCE HITTING WORKERS, DALE AND FEMALE, -- ON HOW FAIRLY OR NOT THEY ARE COMPENSATING WORKERS, MALE OR FEMALE. AND THE MORE WE CAN BRING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE TO PUT IT ON TOP, THE MORE INFORMATION WE CAN HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES AND ADVOCATE FOR EACH OTHER. THIRD, WE NEED TO RAISE WAGES FOR THE LOWEST-PAID JOBS IN AMERICA. THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HELD BY WOMEN, ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MORE WOMEN TO ENTER HIGHER-PAYING FIELDS LIKE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, BUT I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW, EVEN IN THIS ROOM OF ACTIVIST AND WELL INFORMED DEMOCRATS. IN MOST STATES TODAY, WAITRESSES, BARTENDERS, HAIRSTYLIST, AND OTHERS WHO RELY ON TIPS ARE PAID EVEN LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. SOME ARE PAID AS LITTLE AS $2.13 AN HOUR, AND THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO FACE EXPLOITATION, WAGE THEFT, AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY YOU MAY KNOW. THINK ABOUT A MOM TRIED TO SUCCEED AT WORK AND GIVE HER KIDS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WITH A JOB THAT PAYS HER $2.13 AN HOUR. AND FORCES HER TO PUT UP WITH SOME PRETTY AWFUL BEHAVIOR BY CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS OR BOSSES TO TRY TO GET THOSE TIPS TO AT LEAST PUSH IT UP TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVEL. AND FINALLY, WE NEED WORKPLACE POLICIES, LIKE PAID LEAVE, AND FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING THAT ALLOW PARENTS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS AT HOME WITHOUT SACRIFICING PAY AT WORK. NOW, IT IS NO ISSUE THAT WE ARE UP AGAINST SOME PRETTY POWERFUL FORCES, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC THAT WILL DO, SAY, AND THEN WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ADVANCE A VERY DIFFERENT VISION FOR AMERICA. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU. I AM NOT AFRAID TO TAKE THEM ON. YOU KNOW, I HAVE SPENT MY ADULT LIFE GOING TO BAT FOR CHILDREN, FAMILIES, AND OUR COUNTRY, AND I DO KNOW HOW HARD THIS JOB I AM SEEKING IS. I HAVE SEEN IT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CATCH ME WONDERING WHAT IT IS LIKE. [LAUGHTER] CLINTON: INSTEAD, I AM SPENDING MY TIME PLANNING ON WHAT I AM GOING TO DO FOR YOU WHEN I GET THERE. BUT JUST PULL UP THE IMAGES IN YOUR HEAD. ALL OF OUR PRESIDENTS COME INTO OFFICE LOOKING SO VIGOROUS. THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE ON INAUGURATION DAY, AND THEN WE WATCH THEM. THEY GROW GRAYER AND GRAYER, AND BY THE TIME THEY LEAVE, THEY ARE AS WHITE AS THE BUILDING THEY LIVE IN. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU. I AM AWARE I MAY NOT BE THE YOUNGEST CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE, BUT I HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE. I HAVE BEEN COLORING MY HAIR FOR YEARS. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ME TURN WHITE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND YOU'RE ALSO NOT GOING TO SEE ME SHRINK FROM A FIGHT. I THINK BY NOW PEOPLE KNOW I DON'T QUIT. SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME. I HOPE YOU WILL HELP ME BUILD THIS CAMPAIGN, MAKE IT YOUR OWN, TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT US, AND IT HAS TO BE ABOUT WHAT WE DO TOGETHER TO RESTORETH A AND CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM IN THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. I WANT TO END WITH A STORY. SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WE HAD A PRETTY VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN IN 2008. AND BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WORKED REALLY HARD, AND HE WON, AND I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK TO MAKE SURE HE WOULD WIN, AND I WAS SO RELIEVED, I WAS JUST SO RELIEVED WHEN, FINALLY, NOVEMBER 2008 CAME AROUND, AND HE DID. AND THAT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, MY HUSBAND OR -- AND I WERE TAKING A WALK NEAR WHERE WE LIVE, AND HIS PHONE WENT OFF, AND HE ANSWERED IT, IT WAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAID, BILL, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, AND I WANT TO TALK TO HILLARY, AND HE SAID, WELL, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST, BUT AS SOON AS WE GET HOME, AND HE DID. HE TALKED ABOUT POSITIONS IN THE CABINET AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HE WAS ALL OF A SUDDEN BEING CONFRONTED WITH THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TOLD ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE, SO BILL TALKED TO HIM, AND HE THEN HANDED ME THE PHONE, AND HE SAID, I WHAT YOU DO COME TO CHICAGO TO MEET WITH ME, AND I SAID, CERTAINLY, WHEN? HE SAID AS SOON AS YOU CAN, AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO IN THE SENATE TO SUPPORT WHAT HE WOULD BE CHAMPIONING AS PRESIDENT, SO I WENT A FEW DAYS LATER, GO INTO THIS BIG OFFICE BUILDING, AND I SIT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAYS TO ME, I WANT YOU TO BE MY SECRETARY OF STATE. I SAID, WELL, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, I AM FLATTERED. I AM HONORED, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, AND I GAVE HIM NAMES OF PEOPLE I THOUGHT WOULD BE GREAT SECRETARIES OF STATE, AND HE SAID, NO. I HAVE SPENT ALL OF MY TIME DEALING WITH THE ECONOMY. IT IS WORSE THAT WE WERE EVER TOLD, AND YET WE HAVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AROUND THE WORLD, AND I NEED SOMEBODY I CAN SEND OUT THERE TO GO OUT THERE AND TALK TO ANYBODY, AND I WANT IT TO BE YOU. I SAID, WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MOVED I AM, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE. HE SAID, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU SAY YES. [LAUGHTER] AS IS CLINTON: SO I GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT, GET ON THE PLANE, GO BACK TO NEW YORK, AND I AM THINKING, THE RIGHT THING FOR ME IS TO STAY IN THE SENATE. THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK AT A ROUGH TIME. I BECAME A SENATOR, AND EIGHT MONTHS LATER, WE HAD NINE/11, AND I SPENT PEOPLE TRYING TO REBUILD OUR CITY AND PROTECTED, AND I THOUGHT, I NEED TO GO BACK, SO I CALLED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND I SAID, AGAIN, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW HONORED I AM. I WILL SUPPORT YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE, SO I MUST SAY NO, MR. PRESIDENT, AND HE SAID, I TOLD YOU, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SAY YES, AND I SAID TO MY HUSBAND, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS ASKED ME TO BE PRESIDENT -- TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I TOLD HIM NO TWICE, AND HE SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP UNTIL I SAY YES, AND HE SAID, WELL, IF I REMEMBER, I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME TWICE BEFORE YOU SAID YES. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: YOU MIGHT STOP AND THINK. THERE IS A PATTERN HERE. SO I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSE IT HAD BEEN THE REVERSE, AND I HAD BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN, AND I WANTED SOME BUT HE TO BE ON MY CABINET THAT I KNEW I COULD RELY ON, AND I HAD ASKED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. I WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO SAY YES, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY WAS FACING SOME VERY SERIOUS DECISIONS, SO I CALLED HIM BACK THE NEXT DAY, AND I SAID, OK, MR. PRESIDENT, I AM HONORED. I WILL BE YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE. AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON, WE BEGAN TO TALK AND TO WORK TOGETHER. FAST FORWARD, MY FIRST TRIP, I GO TO ASIA IN FEBRUARY 2009, AND I GO BECAUSE I STARTED CALLING PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS, THEY ALL SAID, WE DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, BECAUSE NOBODY HAS BEEN PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO US, AND I SAID, WELL, THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE. THE PRESIDENT AND I SEE ASIANA A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY, AND I AM GOING TO COME, SO I WAS ON MY WAY, AND ONE OF THE COUNTRIES I WAS GOING TO GO TO WAS INDONESIA, AND I AGREED TO DO BOTH THE PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH THE LEADERS AND THE PRESS CONFERENCES, THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU SEE ON TV, AND TO DO A LOT OF WHAT IS CALLED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, WHERE WE WOULD REACH OUT TO PEOPLE, AND WE WOULD BASICALLY SAY, WE CARE ABOUT YOU. WE ARE BACK. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. LET'S TRY TO FIND WAYS WHERE WE CAN BE PARTNERS, AND SEND A DIFFERENT MESSAGE, SO I AGREED TO GO ON A SHOW IN JAKARTA CALLED ""THE AWESOME SHOW,"" AND IT WAS AN EARLY MORNING SHOW, AND IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU SEE ON OUR TV, AND YOU SEE EVERYTHING ON OUR TV THESE DAYS, AND PEOPLE ARE JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND SINGING, AND I AM THINKING, HOPEFULLY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ASK ME TO SING AND DANCE, BUT LUCKILY THEY DID NOT. THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW, AND THEN THEY SAID TO THE AUDIENCE, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, AND THEY CALLED ON THIS PERSON WHO SAID, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. I FOUND THAT THE PEOPLE OVERSEAS FOLLOWED OUR ELECTIONS IN MANY WAYS CLOSER THAN SOME OF US, AND SHE SAID, WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. IT WAS REALLY A HARD-FOUGHT, LONG ELECTION, BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, OUR ELECTIONS LAST FOREVER, COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE ELECTIONS, AND YOU WERE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM, AND HE WAS SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU END UP AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, AND HOW DOES THIS WORK, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS QUESTION, BECAUSE IN A LOT OF PLACES, YOU WANT AGAINST SOMEBODY AND YOU LOSE, YOUR EXILED OR KILLED, NOT APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE, SO I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE IF I COULD READ MY BRAIN UP, I COULD THEY SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY REACHING YOUNG PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT IS A NATION OF A PARTICULAR YOUNG DEMOCRACY, SO I SAID, YOU ARE RIGHT. WE RAN A VERY HARD CAMPAIGN AGAINST EACH OTHER. HE WON, I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK OR HIM BECAUSE HE AND I SHARED MANY OF THE SAME POSITIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE NEXT PRESIDENCY, AND THEN HE WON, AND HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I SAID YES FOR THE SAME REASON, WE BOTH LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND -- [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: NO MATTER HOW HARD THIS ELECTION OR ANY ELECTION BECOMES, WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT AT THE CORE, WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS, AND WE WILL. WE HAVE DIFFERENT GOVERNING PHILOSOPHIES. WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS FOR THE POLICIES. THAT IS ALL FAIR GAME, BUT WE SHOULD SHOW MORE RESPECT TOWARDS EACH OTHER, AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHY WE ARE DOING THIS, BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND WE WANT IT TO BE THE COUNTRY OF HOPE AND POTENTIAL FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN, THAT MANY OF US SAW COME INTO BEING OVER THE LAST DECADES, SO AS I RUN FOR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. WE WILL HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. WE WILL HAVE DEBATES, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE REMEMBERING WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE AT THE CORE OF EVERY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER, AND HOW WE CARE FOR THIS IF WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOST: LET'S GIVE HER ANOTHER ROUND OF APPLAUSE. MADAM SECRETARY, IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO MAKE YOU AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA WOMEN'S COUNCIL. I HAVE A SPECIALTY PIECE OF JEWELRY FOR YOU CREATED BY SALLY HOWARD. THE LONGTIME HISTORY OF THIS. WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TODAY. [APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: I LOVE IT. HOST: WE APPRECIATE MADAM SECRETARY TODAY WEARING BLUE. [APPLAUSE] MADAM SECRETARY: SHOULD I GO AND SAY HELLO? DO YOU HAVE A PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO DO? HOST: EXCUSE ME. THIS CONCLUDES THE PROGRAM. THANKS.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON AND THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS DAY POSSIBLE. THIS DAY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A FABULOUS GREAT YEAR FOR SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC WOMEN. NEXT YEAR WE CULMINATE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, SOUTH CAROLINA, A DEEP SOUTH STATE, IS HOSTING A FEDERATION OF DEMOCRATIC OF WOMEN'S CONVENTION, YES, RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'RE BRINGING IT TO YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW PROUD I AM THAT I'M IN THE ROOM WITH A DUNK OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACTIVISTS, WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE COME ALL OVER THE STATE FOR THIS DAY IN BLUE. MANY OF YOU REGISTERED BEFORE THIS EVENT BEFORE OUR SPEAKER TODAY. I THINK YOU ALL SUSPECTED A COUPLE OF THINGS, BUT I'M SO PROUD TO BE HERE WITH YOU TO STAND BEFORE YOU AND MY PARTNER IN CRIME IN THE DAY IN BLUE IS REPRESENTATIVE GUILDA COBB-HUNTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> GILDA COBB-HUNTER REPRESENTS US AND TAKES CARE OF US ALL AROUND. BOSSES US AROUND AND TAKES CARE OF US. I AM SO PROUD AND HONORED TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND GILDA COBB-HUNTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, SUSEAN. THOSE OF YOU THAT KNOW ME KNOW I START BY SAYING HEY, Y'ALL. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE HERE. LET'S GIVE SUSAN AND THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL PARTNERING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN THIS YEAR'S EVENT. WE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED TO HAVE COLLEAGUES COME TOGETHER FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE TO ENGAGE AND EMPOWER OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD LOUD AND PROUD. AS ALL Y'ALL KNOW, THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF WOMEN IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE WOMAN REPUBLICAN IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA SENATE. THAT MUST CHANGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT THE DIFFERENCE THAT CHANGE IN THE FACES OF OUR GENERAL ASSEMBLY CAN MAKE. WOMEN BRING A UNIQUE AND NECESSARY PERSPECTIVE AND IN OFFICE WILL FIGHT FOR THINGS THAT MATTER TO FAMILIES AND ALL PEOPLE. WE ARE GATHERED TODAY FOR OUR ANNUAL DAY IN BLUE BECAUSE ALL OF US HERE BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE HOUSE AND IN THE SENATE AND ALSO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> IN CASE THERE IS ANY DOUBT, ALSO AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> SPEAKING OF DRA ADDRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE, AS YOU KNOW, SOUTH CAROLINA IS PROUD TO HOST THE FIRST IN THE SOUTH DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AND WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST HERE TODAY. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HER. FOR US SOUTHERNERS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS DEEP SOUTHERN ROOTS WHERE IN ARKANSAS SHE IS STILL CONSIDERED A SPECIAL FAVORITE DAUGHTER. SHE SERVED OR AS I SHOULD SAY, SHE IS STILL CONSIDERED A HOMETOWN GIRL. SHE SERVED AS OUR FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR OF NEW YORK AND SECRETARY OF STATE AND NO MATTER WHERE SHE SERVED, SHE HAS BEEN A TIRELESS CHAMPION FOR WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES. SOUTH CAROLINA, JOIN ME IN WELCOMING HILLARY CLINTON TO THE PALMETTO STATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: WELL, THIS IS SO EXCITING, TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND TO BE HERE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT CAUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL RECRUITS AND TRAINS AND FIELDS MORE WOMEN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: THERE ARE A LOT OF LONG-TIME FRIENDS HERE. I WON'T TRY TO MENTION EVERYBODY, BUT I DO WANT TO THANK SUSAN AND THE ENTIRE BOARD FOR D.W.C. I WANT TO THANK GILDA WHO I THINK HAS BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SINCE 1992, STARTED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND WORKED HER WAY UP. FORMER GOVERNOR JIM HODGES, WE'RE DELIGHTED HE IS HERE, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: A NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CHAIR, A STATE DEMOCRATIC CHAIR, OF COURSE, DON AND CAROL FOWLER, SO HAPPY TO SEE THEM. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: YOUR CANDIDATE FOR THE SENATE LAST TIME, JOYCE DICKERSON. THANK YOU, JOYCE. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: I WAS THINKING ON THE WAY DOWN HERE THAT I FIRST CAME TO SOUTH CAROLINA AS A YOUNG LAWYER WORKING FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND STARTED BY YOUR OWN SOUTH CAROLINA NATIVE MARION WRIGHT EDELMAN FROM BENNETTSVILLE. I CAME BACK MANY TIMES TO RENAISSANCE WEEKEND, GOING TO HILTON HEAD AND THEN TO CHARLESTON. MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS AND HAD A LOT OF GOOD TIME AND AM THRILLED TO BE BACK. I'M BACK BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORT YOU. YOU KNOW THE THEME OF THIS DAY OF EVENTS IS HOW DO BUILD A PARTY AND HOW TO BUILD A PARTY THAT REALLY RESPECTS AND INCLUDES WOMEN AND GIVES WOMEN IN THIS STATE A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY BE AT THE TABLE, BUT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE. CARRYING WITH THEM THEIR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES AND YOU'RE RIGHT, I AM RUNNING TO LIVE AGAIN AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE ALL BY MYSELF. I WANT DEMOCRATS ELECTED FROM THE LOCAL TO THE COUNTY TO THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL ONCE AGAIN MAKING THE CASE THAT WHEN DEMOCRATS WIN, AMERICANS WIN. AND SO I WANT TO SAY JUST A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED FUNDAMENTALLY THAT WHEN FAMILIES ARE STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG. WE HAVE COME THROUGH SOME REALLY TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. I LOOKED AT THE STATISTICS AND SOUTH CAROLINA HAS PULLED ITSELFEN AS OTHER PLACES HAVE AS WELL, AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE MADE A LOT OF SACRIFICES. PEOPLE LOST JOBS. PEOPLE LOST HOMES. PEOPLE HAD TO PUT COLLEGE ON THE BACK BURNER, RETIREMENT ON THE BACK BURNER, BUT EVERYBODY JUST KEPT GOING. IT TOOK A LOT OF DETERMINATION. ACROSS AMERICA WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE RESULTS OF ALL OF THAT HARD WORK. AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A PATTERN. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS AND THERE ARE TWO IN PARTICULAR I'M THINKING ABOUT OVER THE LAST 35 YEARS SEEM TO INHERIT A MESS OF PROBLEMS. HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT? SO THEN THEY HAVE TO DIG US OUT OF THE DITCHES THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN AND PUT US BACK ON THE RIGHT ATTACK. OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT LITTLE CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: BUT, OF COURSE, PRESIDENTS DON'T DO IT ALONE. THEY DO IT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S A PARTNERSHIP. TODAY WE ARE STANDING UP AGAIN, BUT WE'RE NOT YET RUNNING AND WE FACE A CHOICE. ARE WE GOING TO HAND OVER OUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN TO THE PEOPLE AND POLICIES THAT CRASHED OUR ECONOMY BEFORE AND THAT WILL SHRED THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT ANSWER. [LAUGHTER] SEC. CLINTON: BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE ABOUT, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAND UP TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KEEP THE DECK STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUCCESS OF OUR COUNTRY IS SHARED ACROSS THE ECONOMY AND THAT MORE FAMILIES HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD, NOT JUST TO GET BY, BUT TO STAY MOVING FORWARD WITH THE KIND OF CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM THAT HAS ALWAYS MARKED THE BEST TIMES IN AMERICA. YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE WORDS ""MIDDLE CLASS"" MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN. THEY SHOULD REPRESENT A SOLEMN PROMISE, THAT ANYONE WILLING TO WORK HARD CAN EARN A DECENT LIVING AND A BETTER LIFE, NOT JUST GET BY PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THAT'S THE MIDDLE CLASS I GREW UP IN. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN, WHEN I SAY SMALL, IT WAS SMALL. HE RAN A SMALL DRAPERY PRINTING BUSINESS. AND HE LITERALLY HAD A PRINT PLANT WITH BIG LONG TABLES THAT HAD SILK SCREENS AND SOMETIMES MY MOTHER, MY BROTHERS AND I WOULD HELP TO POUR THE PAINT IN AND TAKE THE SQUEEGEE AND THEN WE WOULD CAULK DOWN THE TABLE AND PRINT THE FABRICS. THEN HE WOULD GO OUT AND SELL THEM. IT WAS A GOOD DECENT MIDDLE CLASS LIFE THAT HE PROVIDED TO MY BROTHERS AND ME. AND I AM SO GRATEFUL AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND. IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT SO MANY OF US BELIEVED WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP AND THE FUTURE SEEMED UNLIMITED. OF COURSE, WE HAD TO FIX A LOT OF THINGS IF THE COUNTRY STARTING WITH CIVIL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE OPPORTUNITY LADDER ALWAYS WAS HELD OUT THERE. I JUST CAME FROM KIKI'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I WAS MEETING WITH A GROUP OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS WILMINGTON AND THEY WERE TELLING ME -- BUSINESSWOMEN AND THEY WERE TELLING ME WHAT THEY NEEDED TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE. IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CONVERSATION I REMEMBER AROUND MY DINNER TABLE. THAT'S WHAT LINKS US TOGETHER, PAST ALL OF THE OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT SOMETIMES DIVIDE US. BEING MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA MEANS THAT YOU FEEL IN CONTROL OF YOUR FINANCIAL DESTINY. IT SHOULD MEAN THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE SO YOU CAN WORRY A LITTLE LESS. IT SHOULD MEAN THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN YOUR FUTURE AND THE FUTURE OF YOUR CHILDREN, PUTTING ASIDE SOME FOR EDUCATION, PUTTING ASIDE SOME FOR RETIREMENT. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THAT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE WORKED FOR WON'T BE LOST IN A FLASH BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE OR FAILED TO BE MADE IN WASHINGTON. AND SO, THEREFORE -- [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: -- I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO MAKES CORPORATIONS LIVE UP TO THEIR BASIC GUARANTEE THAT WHEN WORKERS HELP PRODUCE RECORD PROFITS, THOSE WORKERS SHOULD GET A REAL SHARE OF THE REWARDS INSTEAD OF IT ALL GOING TO THOSE AT THE TOP. YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS. SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN TOP C.E.O.'S LEARN 300 TIMES MORE THAN THE TYPICAL AMERICAN WORKER. OR HERE IS MY LATEST LEAST FAVORITE STATISTIC, THE 25 BIGGEST HEDGE FUND MANAGERS EARN MORE THAN ALL THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN AMERICA COMBINED. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR VALUES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PREPARING OUR CHILDREN THROUGH EDUCATION TO MAKE IT IN A VERY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. TODAY TOO MANY POLITICIANS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO THE SAME FAILED TOP-DOWN ECONOMICS ARE MOUTHING THE WORDS ""MIDDLE CLASS."" BUT THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN AND SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO FIGHT FOR. IF THOSE WORDS ARE GOING TO HAVE MEANING AGAIN, THEY HAVE GOT TO BE BACKED UP BY REAL SOLUTIONS, NOT EMPTY RHETORIC. AND THOSE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE WAYS THAT THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED. TODAY 40% OF MOTHERS ARE THE SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNERS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. PARENTS ARE RUBBING HOME FROM WORK TO GET THEIR KIDS HOME FROM SCHOOL AND MAYBE GET THEM OFF TO A PRACTICE OR A REHEARSAL, THEY'RE SQUEEZING EVERY MINUTE OUT OF THEIR 24-HOUR DAY WITH BARELY ENOUGH TIME TO BREATHE LET ALONE RELAX. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A PRACTICING LAWYER BACK IN LITTLE ROCK AND AROUND 3:00 EVERY AFTERNOON, ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO WORKED IN THE FIRM WERE HUNCHED OVER THEIR PHONES KIND OF WHISPERING INTO THEM. AT FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN I REALIZED THEY WERE ALL CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THEIR CHILDREN GOT HOME SAFELY. MANY PEOPLE TODAY CAN'T COUNT ON RELATIVES TO PITCH IN BECAUSE SO MANY FAMILIES ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NOW, I HAPPEN TO BE EXTREMELY LUCKY BECAUSE MY AMAZING 8-MONTH-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LIVES NEAR ME SO I GET TO SEE HER A LOT, BUT NOBODY EXPECTS EVERYTHING TO COME EASY. THAT IS NOT PART OF LIFE, WE KNOW THAT. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE QUITE SO HARD TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD IN AMERICA. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES NEED A CHAMPION, A CHAMPION WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY, NOT FOR SOME AMERICANS, BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS AND I WANT TO BE THAT CHAMPION. I WANT TO GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY GOING TO WORK FOR YOU, STANDING UP FOR YOU, MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: TAKE THE ISSUE OF EQUAL PAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: I DON'T THINK I'M LETTING YOU IN ON A SECRET WHEN I SAY TOO MANY WOMEN STILL EARN LESS THAN MEN ON THE JOB. AND WOMEN OF COLOR OFTEN MAKE EVEN LESS AND THEN THERE IS THE SO-CALLED MOTHERHOOD PENALTY WITH MANY WOMEN TAKING A PAY CUT WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN. ALL OF THIS LOST MONEY ADDS UP. FOR MANY FAMILIES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. THAT'S MEDICINE THAT CAN GO FOR RENT OR GROCERIES OR A NEW CAR OR INTO THE COLLEGE FUND. NOW, WE COULD FIX THIS IF REPUBLICANS WOULD GET ONBOARD. WE IN FACT COULD FIX THIS TODAY, BUT THEY WON'T. IN FACT, ONE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT DISMISSED EQUAL PAY AS A ""BOGUS"" ISSUE. ANOTHER SAID CONGRESS WAS ""WASTING TIME WORRYING ABOUT IT."" ONE EVEN SAID THAT ""EFFORTS TO GUARANTEE FAIR PAY REMINDED HIM OF THE SOVIET UNION."" AND TO THAT I SAY, WHAT CENTURY ARE THEY LIVING IN? BUT THANKFULLY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN ANY PARENT IS SHORT CHANGED, THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS SHORT CHANGED. WHEN FAMILIES ARE SHORT CHANGED, AMERICA IS SHORT CHANGED AND THEREFORE THIS IS NOT A WOMEN'S ISSUE, THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE AND AN AMERICAN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND HERE IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO INSTEAD TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP. FIRST WE [APPLAUSE] GET THE BEST GIVES WOMEN THE LEGAL TOOLS WE NEED TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION AT WORK. I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION BACK IN THE SENATE IN 2007 AND CAP SPONSORING IT AGAIN AND A 10. WELL, IT IS TIME TO GET THIS ON ONCE AND FOR ALL. SECOND, WE SHOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY ACROSS SO THAT WOMEN HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO NEGOTIATE FAIRLY. YOU CANNOT STAND UP FOR EVEN OK IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE PAID EQUALLY. YOU REMEMBER THE LILY LEDBETTER CASE, SHE DID NOT KNOW FOR THE LONGEST TIME THAT SHE WAS NOT PAID AS MUCH AS HER MALE COWORKERS DOING THE SAME JOB. POSTING FOR JOBS SHOULD COME WITH SALARY RANGES, AND LARGE COMPANIES SHOULD REPORT ON HOW FAILING OR NOT THEY ARE CONFERENCE HITTING WORKERS, DALE AND FEMALE, -- ON HOW FAIRLY OR NOT THEY ARE COMPENSATING WORKERS, MALE OR FEMALE. AND THE MORE WE CAN BRING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE TO PUT IT ON TOP, THE MORE INFORMATION WE CAN HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES AND ADVOCATE FOR EACH OTHER. THIRD, WE NEED TO RAISE WAGES FOR THE LOWEST-PAID JOBS IN AMERICA. THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HELD BY WOMEN, ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MORE WOMEN TO ENTER HIGHER-PAYING FIELDS LIKE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, BUT I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW, EVEN IN THIS ROOM OF ACTIVIST AND WELL INFORMED DEMOCRATS. IN MOST STATES TODAY, WAITRESSES, BARTENDERS, HAIRSTYLIST, AND OTHERS WHO RELY ON TIPS ARE PAID EVEN LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. SOME ARE PAID AS LITTLE AS $2.13 AN HOUR, AND THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO FACE EXPLOITATION, WAGE THEFT, AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY YOU MAY KNOW. THINK ABOUT A MOM TRIED TO SUCCEED AT WORK AND GIVE HER KIDS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WITH A JOB THAT PAYS HER $2.13 AN HOUR. AND FORCES HER TO PUT UP WITH SOME PRETTY AWFUL BEHAVIOR BY CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS OR BOSSES TO TRY TO GET THOSE TIPS TO AT LEAST PUSH IT UP TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVEL. AND FINALLY, WE NEED WORKPLACE POLICIES, LIKE PAID LEAVE, AND FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING THAT ALLOW PARENTS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS AT HOME WITHOUT SACRIFICING PAY AT WORK. NOW, IT IS NO ISSUE THAT WE ARE UP AGAINST SOME PRETTY POWERFUL FORCES, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC THAT WILL DO, SAY, AND THEN WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ADVANCE A VERY DIFFERENT VISION FOR AMERICA. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU. I AM NOT AFRAID TO TAKE THEM ON. YOU KNOW, I HAVE SPENT MY ADULT LIFE GOING TO BAT FOR CHILDREN, FAMILIES, AND OUR COUNTRY, AND I DO KNOW HOW HARD THIS JOB I AM SEEKING IS. I HAVE SEEN IT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CATCH ME WONDERING WHAT IT IS LIKE. [LAUGHTER] CLINTON: INSTEAD, I AM SPENDING MY TIME PLANNING ON WHAT I AM GOING TO DO FOR YOU WHEN I GET THERE. BUT JUST PULL UP THE IMAGES IN YOUR HEAD. ALL OF OUR PRESIDENTS COME INTO OFFICE LOOKING SO VIGOROUS. THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE ON INAUGURATION DAY, AND THEN WE WATCH THEM. THEY GROW GRAYER AND GRAYER, AND BY THE TIME THEY LEAVE, THEY ARE AS WHITE AS THE BUILDING THEY LIVE IN. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU. I AM AWARE I MAY NOT BE THE YOUNGEST CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE, BUT I HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE. I HAVE BEEN COLORING MY HAIR FOR YEARS. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ME TURN WHITE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND YOU'RE ALSO NOT GOING TO SEE ME SHRINK FROM A FIGHT. I THINK BY NOW PEOPLE KNOW I DON'T QUIT. SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME. I HOPE YOU WILL HELP ME BUILD THIS CAMPAIGN, MAKE IT YOUR OWN, TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT US, AND IT HAS TO BE ABOUT WHAT WE DO TOGETHER TO RESTORETH A AND CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM IN THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. I WANT TO END WITH A STORY. SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WE HAD A PRETTY VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN IN 2008. AND BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WORKED REALLY HARD, AND HE WON, AND I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK TO MAKE SURE HE WOULD WIN, AND I WAS SO RELIEVED, I WAS JUST SO RELIEVED WHEN, FINALLY, NOVEMBER 2008 CAME AROUND, AND HE DID. AND THAT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, MY HUSBAND OR -- AND I WERE TAKING A WALK NEAR WHERE WE LIVE, AND HIS PHONE WENT OFF, AND HE ANSWERED IT, IT WAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAID, BILL, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, AND I WANT TO TALK TO HILLARY, AND HE SAID, WELL, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST, BUT AS SOON AS WE GET HOME, AND HE DID. HE TALKED ABOUT POSITIONS IN THE CABINET AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HE WAS ALL OF A SUDDEN BEING CONFRONTED WITH THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TOLD ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE, SO BILL TALKED TO HIM, AND HE THEN HANDED ME THE PHONE, AND HE SAID, I WHAT YOU DO COME TO CHICAGO TO MEET WITH ME, AND I SAID, CERTAINLY, WHEN? HE SAID AS SOON AS YOU CAN, AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO IN THE SENATE TO SUPPORT WHAT HE WOULD BE CHAMPIONING AS PRESIDENT, SO I WENT A FEW DAYS LATER, GO INTO THIS BIG OFFICE BUILDING, AND I SIT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAYS TO ME, I WANT YOU TO BE MY SECRETARY OF STATE. I SAID, WELL, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, I AM FLATTERED. I AM HONORED, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, AND I GAVE HIM NAMES OF PEOPLE I THOUGHT WOULD BE GREAT SECRETARIES OF STATE, AND HE SAID, NO. I HAVE SPENT ALL OF MY TIME DEALING WITH THE ECONOMY. IT IS WORSE THAT WE WERE EVER TOLD, AND YET WE HAVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AROUND THE WORLD, AND I NEED SOMEBODY I CAN SEND OUT THERE TO GO OUT THERE AND TALK TO ANYBODY, AND I WANT IT TO BE YOU. I SAID, WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MOVED I AM, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE. HE SAID, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU SAY YES. [LAUGHTER] AS IS CLINTON: SO I GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT, GET ON THE PLANE, GO BACK TO NEW YORK, AND I AM THINKING, THE RIGHT THING FOR ME IS TO STAY IN THE SENATE. THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK AT A ROUGH TIME. I BECAME A SENATOR, AND EIGHT MONTHS LATER, WE HAD NINE/11, AND I SPENT PEOPLE TRYING TO REBUILD OUR CITY AND PROTECTED, AND I THOUGHT, I NEED TO GO BACK, SO I CALLED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND I SAID, AGAIN, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW HONORED I AM. I WILL SUPPORT YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE, SO I MUST SAY NO, MR. PRESIDENT, AND HE SAID, I TOLD YOU, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SAY YES, AND I SAID TO MY HUSBAND, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS ASKED ME TO BE PRESIDENT -- TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I TOLD HIM NO TWICE, AND HE SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP UNTIL I SAY YES, AND HE SAID, WELL, IF I REMEMBER, I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME TWICE BEFORE YOU SAID YES. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: YOU MIGHT STOP AND THINK. THERE IS A PATTERN HERE. SO I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSE IT HAD BEEN THE REVERSE, AND I HAD BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN, AND I WANTED SOME BUT HE TO BE ON MY CABINET THAT I KNEW I COULD RELY ON, AND I HAD ASKED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. I WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO SAY YES, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY WAS FACING SOME VERY SERIOUS DECISIONS, SO I CALLED HIM BACK THE NEXT DAY, AND I SAID, OK, MR. PRESIDENT, I AM HONORED. I WILL BE YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE. AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON, WE BEGAN TO TALK AND TO WORK TOGETHER. FAST FORWARD, MY FIRST TRIP, I GO TO ASIA IN FEBRUARY 2009, AND I GO BECAUSE I STARTED CALLING PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS, THEY ALL SAID, WE DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, BECAUSE NOBODY HAS BEEN PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO US, AND I SAID, WELL, THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE. THE PRESIDENT AND I SEE ASIANA A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY, AND I AM GOING TO COME, SO I WAS ON MY WAY, AND ONE OF THE COUNTRIES I WAS GOING TO GO TO WAS INDONESIA, AND I AGREED TO DO BOTH THE PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH THE LEADERS AND THE PRESS CONFERENCES, THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU SEE ON TV, AND TO DO A LOT OF WHAT IS CALLED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, WHERE WE WOULD REACH OUT TO PEOPLE, AND WE WOULD BASICALLY SAY, WE CARE ABOUT YOU. WE ARE BACK. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. LET'S TRY TO FIND WAYS WHERE WE CAN BE PARTNERS, AND SEND A DIFFERENT MESSAGE, SO I AGREED TO GO ON A SHOW IN JAKARTA CALLED ""THE AWESOME SHOW,"" AND IT WAS AN EARLY MORNING SHOW, AND IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU SEE ON OUR TV, AND YOU SEE EVERYTHING ON OUR TV THESE DAYS, AND PEOPLE ARE JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND SINGING, AND I AM THINKING, HOPEFULLY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ASK ME TO SING AND DANCE, BUT LUCKILY THEY DID NOT. THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW, AND THEN THEY SAID TO THE AUDIENCE, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, AND THEY CALLED ON THIS PERSON WHO SAID, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. I FOUND THAT THE PEOPLE OVERSEAS FOLLOWED OUR ELECTIONS IN MANY WAYS CLOSER THAN SOME OF US, AND SHE SAID, WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. IT WAS REALLY A HARD-FOUGHT, LONG ELECTION, BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, OUR ELECTIONS LAST FOREVER, COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE ELECTIONS, AND YOU WERE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM, AND HE WAS SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU END UP AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, AND HOW DOES THIS WORK, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS QUESTION, BECAUSE IN A LOT OF PLACES, YOU WANT AGAINST SOMEBODY AND YOU LOSE, YOUR EXILED OR KILLED, NOT APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE, SO I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE IF I COULD READ MY BRAIN UP, I COULD THEY SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY REACHING YOUNG PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT IS A NATION OF A PARTICULAR YOUNG DEMOCRACY, SO I SAID, YOU ARE RIGHT. WE RAN A VERY HARD CAMPAIGN AGAINST EACH OTHER. HE WON, I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK OR HIM BECAUSE HE AND I SHARED MANY OF THE SAME POSITIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE NEXT PRESIDENCY, AND THEN HE WON, AND HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I SAID YES FOR THE SAME REASON, WE BOTH LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND -- [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: NO MATTER HOW HARD THIS ELECTION OR ANY ELECTION BECOMES, WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT AT THE CORE, WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS, AND WE WILL. WE HAVE DIFFERENT GOVERNING PHILOSOPHIES. WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS FOR THE POLICIES. THAT IS ALL FAIR GAME, BUT WE SHOULD SHOW MORE RESPECT TOWARDS EACH OTHER, AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHY WE ARE DOING THIS, BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND WE WANT IT TO BE THE COUNTRY OF HOPE AND POTENTIAL FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN, THAT MANY OF US SAW COME INTO BEING OVER THE LAST DECADES, SO AS I RUN FOR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. WE WILL HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. WE WILL HAVE DEBATES, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE REMEMBERING WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE AT THE CORE OF EVERY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER, AND HOW WE CARE FOR THIS IF WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOST: LET'S GIVE HER ANOTHER ROUND OF APPLAUSE. MADAM SECRETARY, IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO MAKE YOU AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA WOMEN'S COUNCIL. I HAVE A SPECIALTY PIECE OF JEWELRY FOR YOU CREATED BY SALLY HOWARD.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON AND THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS DAY POSSIBLE. THIS DAY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A FABULOUS GREAT YEAR FOR SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC WOMEN. NEXT YEAR WE CULMINATE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, SOUTH CAROLINA, A DEEP SOUTH STATE, IS HOSTING A FEDERATION OF DEMOCRATIC OF WOMEN'S CONVENTION, YES, RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'RE BRINGING IT TO YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW PROUD I AM THAT I'M IN THE ROOM WITH A DUNK OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACTIVISTS, WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE COME ALL OVER THE STATE FOR THIS DAY IN BLUE. MANY OF YOU REGISTERED BEFORE THIS EVENT BEFORE OUR SPEAKER TODAY. I THINK YOU ALL SUSPECTED A COUPLE OF THINGS, BUT I'M SO PROUD TO BE HERE WITH YOU TO STAND BEFORE YOU AND MY PARTNER IN CRIME IN THE DAY IN BLUE IS REPRESENTATIVE GUILDA COBB-HUNTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> GILDA COBB-HUNTER REPRESENTS US AND TAKES CARE OF US ALL AROUND. BOSSES US AROUND AND TAKES CARE OF US. I AM SO PROUD AND HONORED TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND GILDA COBB-HUNTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, SUSEAN. THOSE OF YOU THAT KNOW ME KNOW I START BY SAYING HEY, Y'ALL. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE HERE. LET'S GIVE SUSAN AND THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL PARTNERING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN THIS YEAR'S EVENT. WE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED TO HAVE COLLEAGUES COME TOGETHER FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE TO ENGAGE AND EMPOWER OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD LOUD AND PROUD. AS ALL Y'ALL KNOW, THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF WOMEN IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE WOMAN REPUBLICAN IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA SENATE. THAT MUST CHANGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT THE DIFFERENCE THAT CHANGE IN THE FACES OF OUR GENERAL ASSEMBLY CAN MAKE. WOMEN BRING A UNIQUE AND NECESSARY PERSPECTIVE AND IN OFFICE WILL FIGHT FOR THINGS THAT MATTER TO FAMILIES AND ALL PEOPLE. WE ARE GATHERED TODAY FOR OUR ANNUAL DAY IN BLUE BECAUSE ALL OF US HERE BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE HOUSE AND IN THE SENATE AND ALSO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> IN CASE THERE IS ANY DOUBT, ALSO AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> SPEAKING OF DRA ADDRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE, AS YOU KNOW, SOUTH CAROLINA IS PROUD TO HOST THE FIRST IN THE SOUTH DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AND WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST HERE TODAY. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HER. FOR US SOUTHERNERS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS DEEP SOUTHERN ROOTS WHERE IN ARKANSAS SHE IS STILL CONSIDERED A SPECIAL FAVORITE DAUGHTER. SHE SERVED OR AS I SHOULD SAY, SHE IS STILL CONSIDERED A HOMETOWN GIRL. SHE SERVED AS OUR FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR OF NEW YORK AND SECRETARY OF STATE AND NO MATTER WHERE SHE SERVED, SHE HAS BEEN A TIRELESS CHAMPION FOR WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES. SOUTH CAROLINA, JOIN ME IN WELCOMING HILLARY CLINTON TO THE PALMETTO STATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: WELL, THIS IS SO EXCITING, TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND TO BE HERE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT CAUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN'S COUNCIL RECRUITS AND TRAINS AND FIELDS MORE WOMEN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: THERE ARE A LOT OF LONG-TIME FRIENDS HERE. I WON'T TRY TO MENTION EVERYBODY, BUT I DO WANT TO THANK SUSAN AND THE ENTIRE BOARD FOR D.W.C. I WANT TO THANK GILDA WHO I THINK HAS BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SINCE 1992, STARTED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND WORKED HER WAY UP. FORMER GOVERNOR JIM HODGES, WE'RE DELIGHTED HE IS HERE, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: A NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CHAIR, A STATE DEMOCRATIC CHAIR, OF COURSE, DON AND CAROL FOWLER, SO HAPPY TO SEE THEM. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: YOUR CANDIDATE FOR THE SENATE LAST TIME, JOYCE DICKERSON. THANK YOU, JOYCE. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: I WAS THINKING ON THE WAY DOWN HERE THAT I FIRST CAME TO SOUTH CAROLINA AS A YOUNG LAWYER WORKING FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND STARTED BY YOUR OWN SOUTH CAROLINA NATIVE MARION WRIGHT EDELMAN FROM BENNETTSVILLE. I CAME BACK MANY TIMES TO RENAISSANCE WEEKEND, GOING TO HILTON HEAD AND THEN TO CHARLESTON. MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS AND HAD A LOT OF GOOD TIME AND AM THRILLED TO BE BACK. I'M BACK BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORT YOU. YOU KNOW THE THEME OF THIS DAY OF EVENTS IS HOW DO BUILD A PARTY AND HOW TO BUILD A PARTY THAT REALLY RESPECTS AND INCLUDES WOMEN AND GIVES WOMEN IN THIS STATE A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY BE AT THE TABLE, BUT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE. CARRYING WITH THEM THEIR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES AND YOU'RE RIGHT, I AM RUNNING TO LIVE AGAIN AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE ALL BY MYSELF. I WANT DEMOCRATS ELECTED FROM THE LOCAL TO THE COUNTY TO THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL ONCE AGAIN MAKING THE CASE THAT WHEN DEMOCRATS WIN, AMERICANS WIN. AND SO I WANT TO SAY JUST A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED FUNDAMENTALLY THAT WHEN FAMILIES ARE STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG. WE HAVE COME THROUGH SOME REALLY TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. I LOOKED AT THE STATISTICS AND SOUTH CAROLINA HAS PULLED ITSELFEN AS OTHER PLACES HAVE AS WELL, AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE MADE A LOT OF SACRIFICES. PEOPLE LOST JOBS. PEOPLE LOST HOMES. PEOPLE HAD TO PUT COLLEGE ON THE BACK BURNER, RETIREMENT ON THE BACK BURNER, BUT EVERYBODY JUST KEPT GOING. IT TOOK A LOT OF DETERMINATION. ACROSS AMERICA WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE RESULTS OF ALL OF THAT HARD WORK. AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A PATTERN. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS AND THERE ARE TWO IN PARTICULAR I'M THINKING ABOUT OVER THE LAST 35 YEARS SEEM TO INHERIT A MESS OF PROBLEMS. HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT? SO THEN THEY HAVE TO DIG US OUT OF THE DITCHES THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN AND PUT US BACK ON THE RIGHT ATTACK. OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT LITTLE CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: BUT, OF COURSE, PRESIDENTS DON'T DO IT ALONE. THEY DO IT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S A PARTNERSHIP. TODAY WE ARE STANDING UP AGAIN, BUT WE'RE NOT YET RUNNING AND WE FACE A CHOICE. ARE WE GOING TO HAND OVER OUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN TO THE PEOPLE AND POLICIES THAT CRASHED OUR ECONOMY BEFORE AND THAT WILL SHRED THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT ANSWER. [LAUGHTER] SEC. CLINTON: BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE ABOUT, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAND UP TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KEEP THE DECK STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUCCESS OF OUR COUNTRY IS SHARED ACROSS THE ECONOMY AND THAT MORE FAMILIES HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD, NOT JUST TO GET BY, BUT TO STAY MOVING FORWARD WITH THE KIND OF CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM THAT HAS ALWAYS MARKED THE BEST TIMES IN AMERICA. YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE WORDS ""MIDDLE CLASS"" MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN. THEY SHOULD REPRESENT A SOLEMN PROMISE, THAT ANYONE WILLING TO WORK HARD CAN EARN A DECENT LIVING AND A BETTER LIFE, NOT JUST GET BY PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THAT'S THE MIDDLE CLASS I GREW UP IN. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN, WHEN I SAY SMALL, IT WAS SMALL. HE RAN A SMALL DRAPERY PRINTING BUSINESS. AND HE LITERALLY HAD A PRINT PLANT WITH BIG LONG TABLES THAT HAD SILK SCREENS AND SOMETIMES MY MOTHER, MY BROTHERS AND I WOULD HELP TO POUR THE PAINT IN AND TAKE THE SQUEEGEE AND THEN WE WOULD CAULK DOWN THE TABLE AND PRINT THE FABRICS. THEN HE WOULD GO OUT AND SELL THEM. IT WAS A GOOD DECENT MIDDLE CLASS LIFE THAT HE PROVIDED TO MY BROTHERS AND ME. AND I AM SO GRATEFUL AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND. IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT SO MANY OF US BELIEVED WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP AND THE FUTURE SEEMED UNLIMITED. OF COURSE, WE HAD TO FIX A LOT OF THINGS IF THE COUNTRY STARTING WITH CIVIL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE OPPORTUNITY LADDER ALWAYS WAS HELD OUT THERE. I JUST CAME FROM KIKI'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I WAS MEETING WITH A GROUP OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS WILMINGTON AND THEY WERE TELLING ME -- BUSINESSWOMEN AND THEY WERE TELLING ME WHAT THEY NEEDED TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE. IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CONVERSATION I REMEMBER AROUND MY DINNER TABLE. THAT'S WHAT LINKS US TOGETHER, PAST ALL OF THE OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT SOMETIMES DIVIDE US. BEING MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA MEANS THAT YOU FEEL IN CONTROL OF YOUR FINANCIAL DESTINY. IT SHOULD MEAN THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE SO YOU CAN WORRY A LITTLE LESS. IT SHOULD MEAN THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN YOUR FUTURE AND THE FUTURE OF YOUR CHILDREN, PUTTING ASIDE SOME FOR EDUCATION, PUTTING ASIDE SOME FOR RETIREMENT. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THAT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE WORKED FOR WON'T BE LOST IN A FLASH BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE OR FAILED TO BE MADE IN WASHINGTON. AND SO, THEREFORE -- [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: -- I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO MAKES CORPORATIONS LIVE UP TO THEIR BASIC GUARANTEE THAT WHEN WORKERS HELP PRODUCE RECORD PROFITS, THOSE WORKERS SHOULD GET A REAL SHARE OF THE REWARDS INSTEAD OF IT ALL GOING TO THOSE AT THE TOP. YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS. SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN TOP C.E.O.'S LEARN 300 TIMES MORE THAN THE TYPICAL AMERICAN WORKER. OR HERE IS MY LATEST LEAST FAVORITE STATISTIC, THE 25 BIGGEST HEDGE FUND MANAGERS EARN MORE THAN ALL THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN AMERICA COMBINED. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR VALUES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PREPARING OUR CHILDREN THROUGH EDUCATION TO MAKE IT IN A VERY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. TODAY TOO MANY POLITICIANS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO THE SAME FAILED TOP-DOWN ECONOMICS ARE MOUTHING THE WORDS ""MIDDLE CLASS."" BUT THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN AND SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO FIGHT FOR. IF THOSE WORDS ARE GOING TO HAVE MEANING AGAIN, THEY HAVE GOT TO BE BACKED UP BY REAL SOLUTIONS, NOT EMPTY RHETORIC. AND THOSE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE WAYS THAT THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED. TODAY 40% OF MOTHERS ARE THE SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNERS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. PARENTS ARE RUBBING HOME FROM WORK TO GET THEIR KIDS HOME FROM SCHOOL AND MAYBE GET THEM OFF TO A PRACTICE OR A REHEARSAL, THEY'RE SQUEEZING EVERY MINUTE OUT OF THEIR 24-HOUR DAY WITH BARELY ENOUGH TIME TO BREATHE LET ALONE RELAX. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A PRACTICING LAWYER BACK IN LITTLE ROCK AND AROUND 3:00 EVERY AFTERNOON, ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO WORKED IN THE FIRM WERE HUNCHED OVER THEIR PHONES KIND OF WHISPERING INTO THEM. AT FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN I REALIZED THEY WERE ALL CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THEIR CHILDREN GOT HOME SAFELY. MANY PEOPLE TODAY CAN'T COUNT ON RELATIVES TO PITCH IN BECAUSE SO MANY FAMILIES ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NOW, I HAPPEN TO BE EXTREMELY LUCKY BECAUSE MY AMAZING 8-MONTH-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LIVES NEAR ME SO I GET TO SEE HER A LOT, BUT NOBODY EXPECTS EVERYTHING TO COME EASY. THAT IS NOT PART OF LIFE, WE KNOW THAT. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE QUITE SO HARD TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD IN AMERICA. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES NEED A CHAMPION, A CHAMPION WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY, NOT FOR SOME AMERICANS, BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS AND I WANT TO BE THAT CHAMPION. I WANT TO GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY GOING TO WORK FOR YOU, STANDING UP FOR YOU, MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: TAKE THE ISSUE OF EQUAL PAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEC. CLINTON: I DON'T THINK I'M LETTING YOU IN ON A SECRET WHEN I SAY TOO MANY WOMEN STILL EARN LESS THAN MEN ON THE JOB. AND WOMEN OF COLOR OFTEN MAKE EVEN LESS AND THEN THERE IS THE SO-CALLED MOTHERHOOD PENALTY WITH MANY WOMEN TAKING A PAY CUT WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN. ALL OF THIS LOST MONEY ADDS UP. FOR MANY FAMILIES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. THAT'S MEDICINE THAT CAN GO FOR RENT OR GROCERIES OR A NEW CAR OR INTO THE COLLEGE FUND. NOW, WE COULD FIX THIS IF REPUBLICANS WOULD GET ONBOARD. WE IN FACT COULD FIX THIS TODAY, BUT THEY WON'T. IN FACT, ONE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT DISMISSED EQUAL PAY AS A ""BOGUS"" ISSUE. ANOTHER SAID CONGRESS WAS ""WASTING TIME WORRYING ABOUT IT."" ONE EVEN SAID THAT ""EFFORTS TO GUARANTEE FAIR PAY REMINDED HIM OF THE SOVIET UNION."" AND TO THAT I SAY, WHAT CENTURY ARE THEY LIVING IN? BUT THANKFULLY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN ANY PARENT IS SHORT CHANGED, THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS SHORT CHANGED. WHEN FAMILIES ARE SHORT CHANGED, AMERICA IS SHORT CHANGED AND THEREFORE THIS IS NOT A WOMEN'S ISSUE, THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE AND AN AMERICAN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND HERE IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO INSTEAD TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP. FIRST WE [APPLAUSE] GET THE BEST GIVES WOMEN THE LEGAL TOOLS WE NEED TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION AT WORK. I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION BACK IN THE SENATE IN 2007 AND CAP SPONSORING IT AGAIN AND A 10. WELL, IT IS TIME TO GET THIS ON ONCE AND FOR ALL. SECOND, WE SHOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY ACROSS SO THAT WOMEN HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO NEGOTIATE FAIRLY. YOU CANNOT STAND UP FOR EVEN OK IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE PAID EQUALLY. YOU REMEMBER THE LILY LEDBETTER CASE, SHE DID NOT KNOW FOR THE LONGEST TIME THAT SHE WAS NOT PAID AS MUCH AS HER MALE COWORKERS DOING THE SAME JOB. POSTING FOR JOBS SHOULD COME WITH SALARY RANGES, AND LARGE COMPANIES SHOULD REPORT ON HOW FAILING OR NOT THEY ARE CONFERENCE HITTING WORKERS, DALE AND FEMALE, -- ON HOW FAIRLY OR NOT THEY ARE COMPENSATING WORKERS, MALE OR FEMALE. AND THE MORE WE CAN BRING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE TO PUT IT ON TOP, THE MORE INFORMATION WE CAN HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES AND ADVOCATE FOR EACH OTHER. THIRD, WE NEED TO RAISE WAGES FOR THE LOWEST-PAID JOBS IN AMERICA. THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HELD BY WOMEN, ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MORE WOMEN TO ENTER HIGHER-PAYING FIELDS LIKE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, BUT I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW, EVEN IN THIS ROOM OF ACTIVIST AND WELL INFORMED DEMOCRATS. IN MOST STATES TODAY, WAITRESSES, BARTENDERS, HAIRSTYLIST, AND OTHERS WHO RELY ON TIPS ARE PAID EVEN LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. SOME ARE PAID AS LITTLE AS $2.13 AN HOUR, AND THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO FACE EXPLOITATION, WAGE THEFT, AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY YOU MAY KNOW. THINK ABOUT A MOM TRIED TO SUCCEED AT WORK AND GIVE HER KIDS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WITH A JOB THAT PAYS HER $2.13 AN HOUR. AND FORCES HER TO PUT UP WITH SOME PRETTY AWFUL BEHAVIOR BY CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS OR BOSSES TO TRY TO GET THOSE TIPS TO AT LEAST PUSH IT UP TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVEL. AND FINALLY, WE NEED WORKPLACE POLICIES, LIKE PAID LEAVE, AND FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING THAT ALLOW PARENTS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS AT HOME WITHOUT SACRIFICING PAY AT WORK. NOW, IT IS NO ISSUE THAT WE ARE UP AGAINST SOME PRETTY POWERFUL FORCES, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC THAT WILL DO, SAY, AND THEN WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ADVANCE A VERY DIFFERENT VISION FOR AMERICA. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU. I AM NOT AFRAID TO TAKE THEM ON. YOU KNOW, I HAVE SPENT MY ADULT LIFE GOING TO BAT FOR CHILDREN, FAMILIES, AND OUR COUNTRY, AND I DO KNOW HOW HARD THIS JOB I AM SEEKING IS. I HAVE SEEN IT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CATCH ME WONDERING WHAT IT IS LIKE. [LAUGHTER] CLINTON: INSTEAD, I AM SPENDING MY TIME PLANNING ON WHAT I AM GOING TO DO FOR YOU WHEN I GET THERE. BUT JUST PULL UP THE IMAGES IN YOUR HEAD. ALL OF OUR PRESIDENTS COME INTO OFFICE LOOKING SO VIGOROUS. THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE ON INAUGURATION DAY, AND THEN WE WATCH THEM. THEY GROW GRAYER AND GRAYER, AND BY THE TIME THEY LEAVE, THEY ARE AS WHITE AS THE BUILDING THEY LIVE IN. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU. I AM AWARE I MAY NOT BE THE YOUNGEST CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE, BUT I HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE. I HAVE BEEN COLORING MY HAIR FOR YEARS. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ME TURN WHITE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND YOU'RE ALSO NOT GOING TO SEE ME SHRINK FROM A FIGHT. I THINK BY NOW PEOPLE KNOW I DON'T QUIT. SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME. I HOPE YOU WILL HELP ME BUILD THIS CAMPAIGN, MAKE IT YOUR OWN, TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT US, AND IT HAS TO BE ABOUT WHAT WE DO TOGETHER TO RESTORETH A AND CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM IN THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. I WANT TO END WITH A STORY. SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WE HAD A PRETTY VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN IN 2008. AND BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WORKED REALLY HARD, AND HE WON, AND I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK TO MAKE SURE HE WOULD WIN, AND I WAS SO RELIEVED, I WAS JUST SO RELIEVED WHEN, FINALLY, NOVEMBER 2008 CAME AROUND, AND HE DID. AND THAT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, MY HUSBAND OR -- AND I WERE TAKING A WALK NEAR WHERE WE LIVE, AND HIS PHONE WENT OFF, AND HE ANSWERED IT, IT WAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAID, BILL, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, AND I WANT TO TALK TO HILLARY, AND HE SAID, WELL, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST, BUT AS SOON AS WE GET HOME, AND HE DID. HE TALKED ABOUT POSITIONS IN THE CABINET AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HE WAS ALL OF A SUDDEN BEING CONFRONTED WITH THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TOLD ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE, SO BILL TALKED TO HIM, AND HE THEN HANDED ME THE PHONE, AND HE SAID, I WHAT YOU DO COME TO CHICAGO TO MEET WITH ME, AND I SAID, CERTAINLY, WHEN? HE SAID AS SOON AS YOU CAN, AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO IN THE SENATE TO SUPPORT WHAT HE WOULD BE CHAMPIONING AS PRESIDENT, SO I WENT A FEW DAYS LATER, GO INTO THIS BIG OFFICE BUILDING, AND I SIT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAYS TO ME, I WANT YOU TO BE MY SECRETARY OF STATE. I SAID, WELL, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, I AM FLATTERED. I AM HONORED, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, AND I GAVE HIM NAMES OF PEOPLE I THOUGHT WOULD BE GREAT SECRETARIES OF STATE, AND HE SAID, NO. I HAVE SPENT ALL OF MY TIME DEALING WITH THE ECONOMY. IT IS WORSE THAT WE WERE EVER TOLD, AND YET WE HAVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AROUND THE WORLD, AND I NEED SOMEBODY I CAN SEND OUT THERE TO GO OUT THERE AND TALK TO ANYBODY, AND I WANT IT TO BE YOU. I SAID, WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MOVED I AM, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE. HE SAID, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU SAY YES. [LAUGHTER] AS IS CLINTON: SO I GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT, GET ON THE PLANE, GO BACK TO NEW YORK, AND I AM THINKING, THE RIGHT THING FOR ME IS TO STAY IN THE SENATE. THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK AT A ROUGH TIME. I BECAME A SENATOR, AND EIGHT MONTHS LATER, WE HAD NINE/11, AND I SPENT PEOPLE TRYING TO REBUILD OUR CITY AND PROTECTED, AND I THOUGHT, I NEED TO GO BACK, SO I CALLED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND I SAID, AGAIN, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW HONORED I AM. I WILL SUPPORT YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE, SO I MUST SAY NO, MR. PRESIDENT, AND HE SAID, I TOLD YOU, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SAY YES, AND I SAID TO MY HUSBAND, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS ASKED ME TO BE PRESIDENT -- TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I TOLD HIM NO TWICE, AND HE SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP UNTIL I SAY YES, AND HE SAID, WELL, IF I REMEMBER, I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME TWICE BEFORE YOU SAID YES. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: YOU MIGHT STOP AND THINK. THERE IS A PATTERN HERE. SO I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSE IT HAD BEEN THE REVERSE, AND I HAD BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN, AND I WANTED SOME BUT HE TO BE ON MY CABINET THAT I KNEW I COULD RELY ON, AND I HAD ASKED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. I WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO SAY YES, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY WAS FACING SOME VERY SERIOUS DECISIONS, SO I CALLED HIM BACK THE NEXT DAY, AND I SAID, OK, MR. PRESIDENT, I AM HONORED. I WILL BE YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE. AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON, WE BEGAN TO TALK AND TO WORK TOGETHER. FAST FORWARD, MY FIRST TRIP, I GO TO ASIA IN FEBRUARY 2009, AND I GO BECAUSE I STARTED CALLING PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS, THEY ALL SAID, WE DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, BECAUSE NOBODY HAS BEEN PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO US, AND I SAID, WELL, THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE. THE PRESIDENT AND I SEE ASIANA A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY, AND I AM GOING TO COME, SO I WAS ON MY WAY, AND ONE OF THE COUNTRIES I WAS GOING TO GO TO WAS INDONESIA, AND I AGREED TO DO BOTH THE PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH THE LEADERS AND THE PRESS CONFERENCES, THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU SEE ON TV, AND TO DO A LOT OF WHAT IS CALLED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, WHERE WE WOULD REACH OUT TO PEOPLE, AND WE WOULD BASICALLY SAY, WE CARE ABOUT YOU. WE ARE BACK. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. LET'S TRY TO FIND WAYS WHERE WE CAN BE PARTNERS, AND SEND A DIFFERENT MESSAGE, SO I AGREED TO GO ON A SHOW IN JAKARTA CALLED ""THE AWESOME SHOW,"" AND IT WAS AN EARLY MORNING SHOW, AND IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU SEE ON OUR TV, AND YOU SEE EVERYTHING ON OUR TV THESE DAYS, AND PEOPLE ARE JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND SINGING, AND I AM THINKING, HOPEFULLY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ASK ME TO SING AND DANCE, BUT LUCKILY THEY DID NOT. THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW, AND THEN THEY SAID TO THE AUDIENCE, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, AND THEY CALLED ON THIS PERSON WHO SAID, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. I FOUND THAT THE PEOPLE OVERSEAS FOLLOWED OUR ELECTIONS IN MANY WAYS CLOSER THAN SOME OF US, AND SHE SAID, WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. IT WAS REALLY A HARD-FOUGHT, LONG ELECTION, BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, OUR ELECTIONS LAST FOREVER, COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE ELECTIONS, AND YOU WERE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM, AND HE WAS SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU END UP AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, AND HOW DOES THIS WORK, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS QUESTION, BECAUSE IN A LOT OF PLACES, YOU WANT AGAINST SOMEBODY AND YOU LOSE, YOUR EXILED OR KILLED, NOT APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE, SO I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE IF I COULD READ MY BRAIN UP, I COULD THEY SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY REACHING YOUNG PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT IS A NATION OF A PARTICULAR YOUNG DEMOCRACY, SO I SAID, YOU ARE RIGHT. WE RAN A VERY HARD CAMPAIGN AGAINST EACH OTHER. HE WON, I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK OR HIM BECAUSE HE AND I SHARED MANY OF THE SAME POSITIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE NEXT PRESIDENCY, AND THEN HE WON, AND HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I SAID YES FOR THE SAME REASON, WE BOTH LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND -- [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: NO MATTER HOW HARD THIS ELECTION OR ANY ELECTION BECOMES, WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT AT THE CORE, WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS, AND WE WILL. WE HAVE DIFFERENT GOVERNING PHILOSOPHIES. WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS FOR THE POLICIES. THAT IS ALL FAIR GAME, BUT WE SHOULD SHOW MORE RESPECT TOWARDS EACH OTHER, AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHY WE ARE DOING THIS, BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND WE WANT IT TO BE THE COUNTRY OF HOPE AND POTENTIAL FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN, THAT MANY OF US SAW COME INTO BEING OVER THE LAST DECADES, SO AS I RUN FOR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. WE WILL HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. WE WILL HAVE DEBATES, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE REMEMBERING WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE AT THE CORE OF EVERY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER, AND HOW WE CARE FOR THIS IF WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOST: LET'S GIVE HER ANOTHER ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

NOW, RICK SANTORUM TOLD SUPPORTERS HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016. (music) MR. SANTORUM: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT AN AMAZING FEELING TO BE UP HERE WITH THE FOLKS WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME. I WILL START WITH MY FAMILY. I JUST WANT TO THANK KAREN, MY SWEETHEART, ALL MY KIDS, FOR ALL THE SACRIFICES THEY MADE SO WE COULD BE HERE TODAY. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN WORDS. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: AS YOU CAN SEE, WE BROUGHT A LITTLE SPECIAL GIFT. THAT IS OUR DAUGHTER BELLA, WHO JUST TURNED SEVEN YEARS OLD A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: BELLA REQUESTED TO GO PLAY DURING THE SPEECH. WE ARE GOING TO LET HER GO. I KNOW THE STATE IS DENSELY POPULATED WITH OUR FAMILY, BUT WE ARE MISSING OUR SON DANIEL, WHO JUST LAST WEEK, WENT TO FIELD TRAINING IN THE AIR FORCE IN ALABAMA. DANIEL, I AM PROUD OF YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I ALSO HAVE TO THANK UNITED TECHNOLOGIES. WE HAVE DISRUPTED THIS PLACE FOR A WEEK. EVERYBODY, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE, FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE. FOR MANY OF YOU, THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM 32 STATES HERE TONIGHT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS A PIECE OF COAL. THIS IS WHERE MY AMERICAN STORY STARTED. MY GRANDFATHER, PIETRO, WAS A GRANDFATHER WHO BROUGHT MY FATHER, ALDO, FROM FASCIST ITALY. LIKE MANY AMERICANS, HE DID NOT COME FOR THIS. BECAME FOR THIS -- HE CAME FOR THIS -- FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: MY DAD GREW UP IN A COAL TOWN. A COMPANY TOWN, DURING THE DEPRESSION. WITHOUT INDOOR PLUMBING. IT TOOK A WAR TO GET HIM OUT OF THE COLD TOWN TO THE PACIFIC. THAN THE G.I. BILL TO COLLEGE. THEN TO A VETERANS HOSPITAL IN WEST VIRGINIA. IT IS THERE THAT HE MET A WONDERFUL NURSE, CATHERINE, WHO IS MY MOM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: MOM IS 96. I WANT TO SAY HELLO TO MY MOM. THEY TOOK ME ON A VOYAGE AT SEVEN YEARS OF AGE FROM WEST VIRGINIA TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: WE LIVED ON THE VA POST IN WORLD WAR II GOVERNMENT APARTMENTS SURROUNDED BY OUR NATION'S'S VETERANS. . MY FRIENDS, THEIR DADS WORKED IN THE MILLS AND MINDS. THEY COACHED US IN SPORTS AND LIFE. THEY WERE THE GENERATION OF GOD-FEARING PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY AND, AT THE SAME TIME, WHERE THE FOUNDATION OF THE COUNTRY. IN THE LATE 70'S, LIKE MANY OF YOU, WE SAW IT -- THE ECONOMIC DEVASTATION IN PENNSYLVANIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IN MANUFACTURING, AS A RESULT OF THE EXCESSES AND INDIFFERENCE OF BIG LABOR, BIG GOVERNMENT, AND BIG BUSINESS. IN PENNSYLVANIA, WE LOST OVER 100,000 JOBS IN WHAT SEEMED TO BE OVERNIGHT. THAT HAS TO AND DID LEAVE A MARK ON ALL OF US. AFTERWARDS, BIG GOVERNMENT AND BIG BUSINESS TOLD OUR WORKERS THAT TIMES HAVE CHANGED. AMERICAN WORKERS COULD NO LONGER COMPETE WITH LOW FOREIGN WAGES. AND THOSE JOBS WERE GONE FOREVER. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THOSE POLITICIANS? FOR ALL THOSE YEARS, WHAT DID THEY DO? WHAT DID THEY DO FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS AREA AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND IN SMALL TOWN AMERICA? THEY HAD NO PLAN AND THEY PROVIDED NO HOPE. TO THAT, I SAY, NO LONGER. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: AS MIDDLE AMERICA IS HOLLOWING OUT, WE CANNOT SIT IDLY BY AS BIG GOVERNMENT POLITICIANS MAKE IT HARDER FOR OUR WORKERS AND TURN AROUND AND BLAME THEM FOR LOSING JOBS OVERSEAS. WORKING FAMILIES DO NOT NEED ANOTHER PRESIDENT TIED TO BIG GOVERNMENT OR BIG MONEY. TODAY IS THE DAY WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN TO FIGHT BACK. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I AM PROUD TO STAND HERE AMONG YOU AND FOR YOU. THE AMERICAN WORKERS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH. TO ANNOUNCE THAT I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I OFFER A BOLD VISION FOR AMERICA, ONE THAT IS CLEAR AND CONSERVATIVE. IT HAS PLANS OF REFORM AND A PROVEN TRACK RECORD FROM MY TIME IN SERVICE. STEP ONE, LET'S GRAB THE CORRUPT FEDERAL TAX CODE AND THE IRS THAT GOES WITH IT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: IT IS TIME TO GIVE AMERICA A SIMPLE, FAIR, FLAT TAX. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: IT WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. IT WILL REBUILD OUR FACTORIES AND INCREASE TAKE-HOME PAY FOR WORKERS IN AMERICA. POWERED BY THE SHALE REVOLUTION AND THE RENEWABLE REVOLUTION. POWERED BY THOSE TWO REVOLUTIONS, WE HAVE REGAINED THE TITLE OF WORLD LEADER IN ENERGY PRODUCTION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: WITH LOW-COST ENERGY AND OUR BOLD PLAN, I PROMISE YOU -- WE WILL REGAIN THE TITLE OF A LEADER IN WORLD MANUFACTURING. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: THAT IS NOT ALL. WE WILL SHRINK GOVERNMENT, REDUCE SPENDING, WE WILL REVOKE EVERY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND REGULATION -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: WE WILL REVOKE EVERY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND REGULATION THAT COST AMERICAN JOBS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: FROM DAY ONE, WE WILL WORK TO BRING BACK AMERICA AND PUT AMERICANS BACK TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: AMERICAN WORKERS DESERVE A SHOT AT THESE JOBS. OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, WE HAVE BROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY, LEGALLY AND ILLEGALLY, 35 MILLION MOSTLY UNSKILLED WORKERS. THE RESULT OVER THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME? WORKERS' WAGES HAVE FLATLINED. HILLARY CLINTON AND BIG BUSINESS , THEY HAVE CALLED FOR A MASSIVE INFLUX IN UNSKILLED LABOR. BUSINESS DOES IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CONTROL COSTS. HILLARY DOES IT BECAUSE SHE WANTS VOTES. THEIR PRIORITIES ARE PROFITS AND POWER. MY PRIORITY IS YOU, THE AMERICAN WORKER. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. YESTERDAY, THE LARGEST PRO-WORKER IMMIGRATION GROUP JUST PUBLISHED A SURVEY THAT SHOWED ONLY ONE CANDIDATE GOT AN ""A"" STANDING BEHIND AMERICAN WORKERS, AND HE IS STANDING HERE TODAY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: WE CAN CREATE JOBS. AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN, AMERICA CANNOT SUCCEED UNLESS WE STRENGTHEN THE FIRST ECONOMY -- THE AMERICAN FAMILY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: IT IS TIME WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO SEES THE STRUGGLE OF WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA NOT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIVIDE US ALONG RACE OR CLASS BUT AS A CHANCE TO UNITE US AROUND THE IDEAL THAT EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA DESERVES HER BIRTHRIGHT -- TO BE RAISED BY HER PARENTS IN A HEALTHY HOME. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: STRONGER FAMILIES AND MORE JOBS RESULT IN BETTER SCHOOLS. BUT OUR CHILDREN, WELL, THEY DESERVE AND EDUCATION CUSTOMIZED, CUSTOMIZED, TO MAXIMIZE THEIR POTENTIAL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS IS JOINING ME AND DRIVING A STAKE IN THE HEART OF COMMON CORE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I CANNOT FORGET ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE I GREW UP WITHOUT IN BUTLER -- OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS. I SAW THE PRICE OF FREEDOM. I SAW THE COST OF FAILED POLITICAL LEADERSHIP. THE OBAMA CHAIM A -- OBAMA -CLINTON REGIME DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT PIECE COMES THROUGH STRENGTH. [APPLAUSE] >> USA, USA. MR. SANTORUM: WHAT I SEE OUR HEROIC VETERANS DYING, WAITING IN LINE BECAUSE THESE VERY SAME LEADERS DO NOT CARE ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY HAVE EARNED -- THE BEST MEDICAL CARE IN THE WORLD. I SAY JOIN ME, TAKE BACK AMERICA, AND HELP THESE VETERANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: AS YOU HAVE SEEN, COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS NOT AN ENTRY-LEVEL POSITION. AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS THE LAST PLACE FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. IS CRITICAL THAT BOTH OUR ALLIES AND OUR FRIENDS KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: LAST MONTH, I WAS FEATURED IN AN ONLINE MAGAZINE. THAT IS USUALLY A GOOD THING. BUT IN THIS CASE, THE ONLINE MAGAZINE WAS THE MAGAZINE OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, ISIS. UNDER THE HEADLINE, IN THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMY, WAS MY PICTURE AND A QUOTE. AFTER 12 YEARS OF LEGISLATING AND WARNING ABOUT THE GATHERING STORM OF RADICAL ISLAM, THEY KNOW WHO I AM. AND I KNOW WHO THEY ARE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: IN THAT ARTICLE, I DESCRIBED WHO THEY ARE AND HOW TO DEFEAT THEM. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF I AM THE NEXT PRESIDENT, WE WILL DEFEAT THEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: FINALLY, WE MUST TAKE BACK AMERICA FROM THOSE WHO SEEK TO DENY US OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS OF LIFE AND LIBERTY. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY LIFE MATTERS. THE POOR, THE DISABLED, AND THE UNBORN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I WILL ALSO FIGHT FOR THE FREEDOM FOR YOU TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE CALLED TO BELIEVE, NOT JUST IN YOUR PLACES OF WORSHIP, BUT OUTSIDE ARE PLACES OF WORSHIP TOO. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: KAREN AND I HAVE LEARNED A LOT IN OUR LIFE. IF THERE IS ONE THING WE HAVE LEARNED, MAN IS LIMITED AND GOD IS NOT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: THERE IS MUCH WE CAN DO. BUT FIRST, WE NEED TO PRAY FOR THE SAME KIND OF GREAT AWAKENING THAT INSPIRED AND PROVIDED OUR FOUNDING TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY TO HEAL OUR LAND. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: IF YOU WATCH ANY OF THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS COMING UP THIS WEEK, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF FOLKS SAYING WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO. THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO TO TRUST? YOU LOOK AT THEIR RECORD. I WENT TO WASHINGTON AND SAID I WAS GOING TO FIGHT TO -- CORRUPTION. AND I DELIVERED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I WENT TO END WELFARE, REDUCE POVERTY, AND PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. I DELIVERED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I WENT TO GIVE PATIENTS CONTROL OVER HEALTH CARE, AND I DELIVERED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I WENT TO END PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION, AND I DELIVERED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I WENT TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON SYRIA AND IRAN PROTECT THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND THIS COUNTRY, AND I DELIVERED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I WENT TO CUT TAXES AND PROMISED NEVER TO RAISE THEM. AND I DELIVERED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: OUR RECORD OF STANDING FOR YOU AND STANDING UP AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT IS CLEAR. 92% CONSERVATIVE VOTING RECORD. HOW DOES SOMEONE LIKE THAT GET ELECTED IN THE MONDE VALLEY OF THIS BIRD? -- PITTSBURGH? HOW DOES SOMEONE WITH A CONSERVATIVE VOTING RECORD GET ELECTED TWICE IN PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE THERE IS ALMOST A MILLION MORE REGISTERED DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS? BECAUSE I STOOD FOR YOU AND AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON DC. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: FIGHTING IN THOSE RACES IN PENNSYLVANIA, I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE AN UNDERDOG. FOUR YEARS AGO, NO ONE GAVE US MUCH OF A CHANCE. BUT WE WON 11 STATES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: WE GOT 4 MILLION VOTES. NOT JUST BECAUSE I STOOD FOR SOMETHING. IT IS BECAUSE I STOOD FOR SOMEONE -- THE AMERICAN WORKER. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: I PROMISED THEN AS I PROMISED NOW, I WILL TAKE MONEY AND POWER OUT OF WASHINGTON AND PUT IT BACK WHERE OUR CONSTITUTION SAYS IT BELONGS -- IN THE PEOPLE WHO EARNED IT. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""RICK"" GUEST: --] MR. SANTORUM: THE LAST RACE, WE CHANGED THE DEBATE. THIS RACE, WITH YOUR HELP, AND GOD'S GRACE, WE CAN CHANGE THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANTORUM: JOIN US.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?326111-1/hillary-clinton-small-business-lending,Hillary Clinton on Small Business Lending,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"NOW, HILLARY CLINTON CONTINUES HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN CEDAR FALLS, IOWA, PART OF HER SECOND VISIT TO THE EARLY CAUCUS STATE AS A CANDIDATE. THIS ALSO MARKS HER FIRST BRIEFING WITH REPORTERS IN THREE WEEKS. SHE ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON IRAQ AND HER STATE DEPARTMENT E-MAIL IT WE WILL HAVE THAT FOLLOWING THIS ROUNDTABLE WITH LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IT IS JUST OVER ONE HOUR. HILLARY CLINTON: HI, EVERYBODY. WELL, FIRST LET ME THANK ALL OF YOU IN PARTICULARLY, OUR ROUNDTABLE PARTICIPANTS FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT PAYMENT -- FOR WELCOMING US TO THIS FACILITY. I'M DELIGHTED TO TALK ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS. BUT I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING MORE BROADLY WITH THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND AMERICAN. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED FUNDAMENTALLY THAT WHEN FAMILIES ARE STRONG, OUR COUNTRY IS STRONG. WE HAVE COME BACK FROM VERY TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES, I DON'T NEED TO TELL ANYBODY THAT. OUR ECONOMY AND OUR COUNTRY ARE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE TODAY. IN LARGE MEASURE, BECAUSE FAMILIES WORKED SO HARD. THEY TOOK EXTRA JOBS, THEY SKIPPED VACATIONS, THEY SCRE IMPED AND MADE IT WORK. BUT THE DECK IS STILL SEX FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT THERE SHAKE YOUR SOMETHING IS --. SOMETHING'S WRONG WHEN CEOS EARN MORE THAN 300 TIMES THAN WHAT THE TYPICAL AMERICAN WORKER EARNS. WHEN HEDGE FUND MANAGERS A LOWER TAX RATES THAN TRUCK DRIVERS OR NURSES. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES NEED A CHAMPION AND I WANT TO BE THAT CHAMPION. I WANT FAMILIES TO DO MORE THAN JUST GET BY. I WANT THEM TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. I WANT TO MAKE THE WORD MIDDLE-CLASS MEANS SOMETHING AGAIN. SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE THIS ONE, AND ONCE YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT TODAY, HAVE TO BE AT THE HEART OF THAT EFFORT, CREATING JOBS, DRIVING GROWTH, GIVING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR OWN GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. I DID NOT LEARNED THIS FROM POLITICS. I LEARNED THIS FROM MY FATHER, WHO WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE HAD A VERY SMALL BUSINESS. HE PRINTED DRAPERY PRODUCTS AND SOLD THEM. MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS AND I AND OCCASIONAL DAY LABORERS WOULD HELP OUT WITH THE PRINTING PROCESS. THAT IS WHAT PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLE, AND IS WHAT GAVE US A SOLID MIDDLE-CLASS HOME. TODAY, SMALL BUSINESSES ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY HAD WORKED HIMSELF -- THEMSELVES BACK FROM THE PERFECT STORM OF CRISIS WHEN SALES AND CREDIT TOGETHER DRIED UP. AND BUSINESSES ARE STARTING TO SORT OUT HOW THEY CAN GROW AGAIN, HOW THEY CAN ADD JOBS, AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. BUT I THINK THE DEBT IS BACK AS WELL. ASK ANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, AS I HAVE, AND THEY WILL TELL YOU IT IS WRONG THAT IS SO EASY FOR BIG CORPORATIONS TO GET BREAKS, BUT SO HARD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES EVEN TO GET A LOAN. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE LONGER TO START A BUSINESS IN AMERICA THAN IT DOES IN CANADA OR FRANCE, BUT THAT IS THE FACT. I WANT TO BE A SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT WHO DOES MAKE IT EASIER TO START AND RUN A SMALL BUSINESS AGAIN IN AMERICA. IT SEEMS LESS LIKE A GAMBLE AND MORE LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. FIRST, WE NEED TO CUT THE UNNECESSARY RED TAPE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE COSTED TIME AND MONEY AND KEEP NEW ENTREPRENEURS OUT. WE SHOULD DESCRIBE FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO FIND RESPONSIBLE WAYS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, AND WE SHOULD OFFER INCENTIVES TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THE SAME. THAT IS WHERE MANY OF THE OBSTACLES STILL LIVE. SECOND, WE NEED TO SIMPLIFY TAX FILINGS AND PROVIDE TARGETED CREDIT AND REDUCTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, NOT JUST THE BIG CORPORATIONS THAT CAN AFFORD LAWYERS AND LOBBYISTS TO FIND EVERY LOOPHOLE. THIRD, WE SHOULD USE TECHNOLOGY TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES INTO NEW MARKETS, WHETHER IT IS ACROSS TOWN OR THE STATE OR ACROSS THE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT I DID IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EBAY IN UPSTATE K NEW YORK WHEN I WAS A SENATOR. WE STARTED SOMETHING TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAD NEVER SOLD YOUNG THE LOCAL COMMUNITY REACH CUSTOMERS VERY FAR AWAY. FOURTH, AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS, I WILL FIGHT TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN GET THE FINANCING THEY NEED TO BUILD AND HIRE INCLUDING, WOMEN AND MINORITY EMPLOYEES WHO FACE EXTRA BARRIERS. THIS MORNING, A BIG HEADLINE. I LOVE RANKS LAST FOR WOMEN-OWNED -- IOWA RANKS LAST FOR WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES. THIS COULD NOT BE A MORE TIMELY ARTICLE FOR OUR DISCUSSION. ALTHOUGH IT SAYS IOWA HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS, IT SAW THE LOWEST GROWTH IN THOSE BUSINESSES BY WOMEN FROM 1997 TO 2015. AND WOMEN-OWNED COMPANIES HAD THE LEAST ECONOMIC CLOUT IN IOWA COMPARED TO ALL OTHER STATES AND WASHINGTON DC. SO, THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY, BUT ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR FRIENDS HERE IN IOWA. ACCESS TO CREDIT CAN BE AS IMPORTANT TO GROWING A SMALL BUSINESS AS IT IS FOR THE BIG ONES. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY TO GET A LOAN. THESE LOANS HAVE ALWAYS COME FROM COMMUNITY BANKS SMALL BUSINESSES WITH DEEP LOCAL TIES. TODAY THOSE SAME BANKS ARE BEING SQUEEZED BY REGULATIONS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE FOR THEIR SIZE AND MISSION, LIKE ENDLESS EXAMINATIONS AND PAPERWORK DESIGNED FOR BANKS THAT MEASURE ASSETS IN THE BILLIONS. WHEN IT GETS HARDER FOR SMALL BANKS, IT GETS HARDER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO GET LOANS. WE CAN EASE THE BURDENS FOR COMMUNITY BANKS WITHOUT HARMING CONSUMERS AND WITHOUT LETTING UP A ONE BIT ON WALL STREET. WE SHOULD NOT APPLY THE SAME RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNITY BANKS AS THOSE NEEDED TO REGULATE BIG BANKS. LET'S BE CLEAR. IT IS NOT BANKS THAT NEED RELIEF FROM WASHINGTON. IT IS SMALL BANKS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO REIN IN RISKY BEHAVIOR ON WALL STREET AND TOO BIG TO FAIL BANKS, NOT LESS. I FULLY SUPPORT REGULATIONS ON THE BIG BANKS. BUT, WE SHOULD PASS COMMONSENSE COMMUNITY BANKING REFORM RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER, THE REPUBLICANS IN THE CONGRESS INSIST ON USING THIS ISSUE TO GIVE RELIEF TO COMMUNITY BANKS AS A TROJAN HORSE FOR ROLLING BACK PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS, AND ROLLING BACK THE RULES ON THE BIGGEST BANKS. AS WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW IN LEGISLATION THE REPUBLICANS ARE INTRODUCING, WE SHOULD CALL THIS WHAT IT IS. A CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO GAIN THE SYSTEM FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. OUR GOAL SHOULD BE HELPING COMMUNITY BANKS SERVE THEIR NEIGHBORS AND CUSTOMERS THE WAY THEY ALWAYS HAVE. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GIVE OUT RESPONSIBLE LOANS TO RESPONSIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES, SO THEY CAN N DO WHAT THEY DO BEST, TO CREATE JOBS AND HELP FAMILIES STAY AHEAD. I'M VERY EAGER TO HEAR THE IDEAS FROM EVERYONE AROUND THE TABLE. I SEE SOME OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND I'M EAGER TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS AS WELL. WE KNOW THEY ARE OBSTACLES. WE WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN OVERCOME THEM. WE WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP SMALL BUSINESSES GROW AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP COMMUNITY BANKS TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET TO BE ABLE TO DO WITH THEY WANT TO DO MOST, WHICH IS TO HELP BUSINESSES IN THEIR COMMUNITY GROW AND EXPAND. TAKE IT AWAY. >> MY DON'T WE START WITH INTRODUCTIONS? >> I'M FRED JOHNSON. AND PRIVACY SO MANY PEOPLE HERE TODAY. >> I'M GONE, I'M THE CHAIR OF THE TRUST BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE MANY COMMUNITY BANKS, NOT JUST IN IOWA, BUT THE NATIONWIDE AS WELL. >> I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HOSTING -- NOT HOSTING BUT ACTUALLY MODERATING AND BE A PANELIST WHICH IS HARD TO DO. WHY DON'T WE START WITH SOME QUESTIONS. >> WELL, I JUST NEED TO SAY AFTER HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT THE REGULATORY BURDENS, I CAN NOT TELL YOU HOW ENTHUSED ALL OF US MANY THE COMMUNITY BANKING WORLD ARE EXCITED TO HEAR THIS 88% OF THE BANKS MANY THIS COUNTRY ARE COMMUNITY BANKS. AND WE ARE LOSING THOSE AT RAPID RATE UNFORTUNATELY, ABOUT 10 EVERY YEAR IN IOWA AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY BURDEN THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED UPON US. YOU KNOW, WE EXIST TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BREAD AND BUTTER. WE GO HAND AND HAND AS A PARTNER WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. AND THE BURDENS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FROM A DOCUMENTATION STATION POINT THOSE THINGS IMPACT US AS WELL BIG TIME. IT CREATES EXTRA EXPENSE FOR US. I THINK THE ANNUAL SALARY FOR A COMPLIANCE OFFICER IS $73,400 WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY BURDEN ON SMALLER BANKS. BELIEVE ME, WE NEED TO BE REGULATED, CERTAINLY. WE NEED TO BE REGULATED. OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES, EVERYBODY CAN TRUST US WITH THEIR MONEY. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT. WE SHOULD BE REGULATED. BUT THE REGULATIONS AS YOU SUGGEST NEED TO BE ALLOCATED APPROPRIATELY FOR RISK PROFILE BUSINESS MODELS, SIZE, GEOGRAPHY, EVERYTHING ELSE. MY IMMEDIATE REACTION TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YAY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY BANKERS. >> IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON WHAT YOU SAID BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE FORGET THEY OFTEN LOOK AT OUR BANKING INDUSTRY AND SEE THE GREAT BIG BANKS WITH THEIR MANY, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ADD THEM ALL UP TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ABSENCE AND THEY THINK THAT'S WHAT REPRESENTS AMERICAN BANKING. BUT 88% OF OUR BANKS ARE STILL BANKING. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO BOARD MEMBERS, OFFICERS AND WHAT THEY SAID WHAT WAS MEANT TO REIN TOO BIG TO FAIL HAS FALLEN HARDER ON THEM AND THAT'S WHY THEY NEED RELIEF BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM. AND YET THEY'RE IN SOME WAY SAYING A DISPROPORTIONATE PRICE FOR OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO RESTRAIN THE BEHAVIORS OF THE BIG BANKS. IS THAT FAIR? >> THAT IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. AND WE AS COMMUNITY BANKS DO NOT CREATE ANY SYSTEMIC RISK. WE ARE NOT TOO LITTLE TO FAIL. SO WE -- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THE REGULATIONS AGAIN, WE NEED BE A REGULATED INDUSTRY. HOWEVER, THEY NEED TO MAKE SENSE FOR THE DIFFERENCE SIZE, RISK PROFILES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. THAT'S VERY, VERIED NEWS. WE WANT TO LOAN MONEY. >> BUT WHAT I SEE HAPPENING WHICH IS WHY I MENTIONED IT AT THE END OF MY REMARKS IS THAT COMMUNITY BANKS ARE PAYING THE PRICE IN TWO WAYS, PAYING THE PRICE FOR BEING REGULATED AS THOUGH YOU WERE LARGE BANKS THAT PRESENT SYSTEMIC RISKS AND PAYING THE PRICE BECAUSE IT'S THE TROJAN HORSE IDEA THAT I MENTIONED WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE NOW CLAIMING THEY NEED TO MAKE ALL THESE CHANGES IN DOD FRANK AND BANK REGULAR LAY -- DODD-FRANK AND BANK REGULATIONS. WE OUGHT TO KEEP THE REGULATIONS WHERE THEY BELONG ON BIG BANKS AND PROVIDE RELIEF FIRE FIGHTER THE COMMUNITY BANKS. ISN'T THAT DOABLE? AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT? >> I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY DOABLE IN OUR ECONOMY AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. WEER YRKS -- YES, THAT HAS A MEANINGFUL IMPACT. COUP -- GIVE US A BREAK SO WE CAN LOAN MORE MONEY. >> GO AHEAD. >> THIS MAKES ME VERY HAPPY. AND I STARTED MY FIRST BUSINESS AT THE AGE OF 15 BECAUSE THE LOCAL BANKER KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, KNEW I WAS A HARD WORKER, FOUND ME PEDDLING ON THE STREETS IN THE SCHOOL. THE BANK PRESIDENT KNEW ME, KNEW MY WORK ETHIC AND BELIEVED IN WHAT I WAS DOING AND KNEW THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THE COMMUNITY NEEDED. A LARGE BANK NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. HILLARY: THAT'S AN AMAZING STORY. SO YOU HAVE THE INTEPRENEURAL GENES. YOU WERE LIKE 15 AND YOU WERE GOING PLACE TO PLACE SELLING BAKED GOODS AND THEN AT 20 YOU DECIDED TO START A RESTAURANT. >> I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT AT THE TIME. IT WAS A FUN HOBBY THAT KIND OF JUST KEPT GROWING AND GROWING. HILLARY: WHEN YOU STARTED GOLDIES HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN? >> I WAS 20. HILLARY: SO YOU WERE 20 -- >> >> I BOUGHT AN ICE CREAM SHOP FROM A LADY THAT HAD RETIRED. AT THAT TIME THEY HADN'T HAD ONE IN YEARS. AND NOW HAS GROWN TO A FULL SCALE RESTAURANT THAT DOES OVER $700,000 IN SALES. HILLARY: HOW MANY EMPLOYEES? >> I HAVE 30 EMPLOYEES. HILLARY: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO GET MOVING AGAIN THE ECONOMY SO THAT MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO WHAT YOU DID RIGHT NOW. AS YOU BEGAN TO BUILD YOUR BUSINESS, DID YOU ENCOUNTER OBSTACLES AND PROBLEMS AND I THINK YOU WERE ALSO, YOU KNOW, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT RECESSION WHILE YOU WERE TRYING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE REALITIES THAT YOU HAD TO OVERCOME? >> YOU KNOW, STARTING RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE, I THOUGHT THAT I KNEW EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW? SO I OPENED A RESTAURANT AND I'VE BEEN DOING FOOD SERVICE FOR A FEW YEARS. I DIDN'T KNOW AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT I DID. IT WAS A REALLY TOUGH HURDLE TO GET THE EXPENSES REIN IN. IT TOOK MORE FOUR YEARS AND I LOST A LOT OF MONEY. FORTUNATELY MY BANKER WAS VERY PATIENT WITH ME AND SAW THE POTENTIAL AND WAS ABLE -- ENABLING LING ME -- ENABLE ME TO GET THE FUNDS. HILLARY: HE HAS THE AMBITION AND THE WORK ETHIC AND THE IDEAS AND YOU'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON HIM BECAUSE OF THAT? >> ABSOLUTELY. WE KNOW HIS STORY. WE KNOW OUR LOCAL MARKET. AND WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND SO WE ARE ABLE WITH LOCAL DECISION MAKING TO EXTEND HIS CREDIT MAYBE ON MORE FAVORABLE TERMS BECAUSE WE'RE NEIGHBORS. AND THAT'S, I THINK IS THE DIFFERENCE. BUT I WANTED TO THROW SOMETHING IN. YOU COMMENTED, BRAD, THAT YOU KIND OF DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET STARTED. THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING AND VERY COMMON THING WHEN WE SEE ENTREPRENEURS AND TALK TO HER BANKERS. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ABOUT PLEDGES ABOUT FINANCIAL PROJECTION. THEY JUST WANT TO THROW OUT THERE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FREE RESOURCES IN THIS COUNTRY AVAILABLE PLAYS OUT DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT AREAS BUT FOUR, YOU KNOW, THE RETIRES EXECUTIVES THAT HAVE A WONDERFUL FREE RESOURCE. I KNOW A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO NEW BUSINESS OWNERS AND ENTREPRENEURS. CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS CAN HELP TOO ON THAT POINT. >> IT'S A WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT ONE OF THOSE RESOURCES THROUGH THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CERTAIN. >> YEAH, THOSE ARE GREAT. AS I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OK, I HAVE -- MY DEBT IS GROWING. MY SALES -- MY INCOME ISN'T PAYING ALL THE EXPENSES BUT I'M LINED OUT THE DOOR. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG? I'M ALWAYS BUSY BUT I'M NOT MAKING ANY MONEY. I HAD A GREAT SET ITCH TO GET ME SOME GREAT AVENUES. HERE'S THE THING TO WORK ON. THESE ARE THE RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN WORK ON FOR HEALTH AND ASSISTANCE AND COUNSELING. IT WAS GREET HAVE THAT. BECAUSE IN -- IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE THAT. BECAUSE IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE THAT CONNECTION. HILLARY: HOW GID YOU FIND YOUR WAY THERE? >> I WENT TO THE CITY MANAGER. I SAID IT SHOULD BE WORKING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HE CONNECTED ME OUR COUNTY DEVELOPMENT OFFICE WHICH THEN LED ME TO -- HILLARY: THAT'S GREAT. I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT. EVEN IF YOU'VE GOT THE DRIVE AND THE AMBITION YOU MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE SKILLS OR THE EXPERIENCE AND THE MORE YOU CAN RELY ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND RESOURCES TO HELP YOU GET OVER THOSE HURDLES, THE BETTER. SO AND YOU DO A LOT OF THAT. DON'T YOU DO A LOT OF CONNECTING PEOPLE UP THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS? WHY DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS AND WHAT IT DOES TO HELP. >> ACTUALLY I STARTED CONSULTING A BUSINESS IN 2007 PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT GREW OUT OF A PASSION OF BEING ABLE TO GIVE BACK BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT AS YOU SAID SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE ENGINE THAT DRIVES A COMMUNITY AND WHEN WE CAN TAKE THAT AND BRING THAT INTO A LARGER ECOSYSTEM OF CARING AN COMPASSION AND SENSITIVITY NOT TO DISCOURAGE BUSINESS PEOPLE. I THINK THE POLICY MIGHT NOT BE INTENTIONALLY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM STARTING BUSINESSES BUT THERE ARE POLICIES IN PLACE THAT DO. HILLARY: LIKE WHAT? GIVE US AN EXAMPLE. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE IN THE PAST IS WORK WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES THERE. THERE ARE A LOT OF PATHOLOGIES THERE. AND SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE -- IN FACT, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU FROM SOMEONE THAT KIND OF EXPRESSES SOME OF THE ISSUES OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO START BUSINESSES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CREDIT. THEY MIGHT HAVE CHALLENGES THAT WILL FOLLOW THEM FOR YEARS AND YEARS AN YEARS AND SOMETIMES FOREVER. HERE'S THE QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TO MAKE FUNDING LOANS MORE AVAILABLE TO YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS IN --? WILL YOU CHANGE THE LANGUAGE IN THE LAW THAT PROHIBITS PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS, THESE LOANS OR DO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES IN THEIR PAST NOT MATTER IN SOCIETY ANYMORE? >> YEAH. >> SO I WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE IN SOME OF THOSE SITUATIONS. AND SOME OF THE POLICIES, POLICIES OF NOT BEING ABLE TO VOTE. HILLARY: RIGHT. >> OR POLICIES OF CREDIT, YOU KNOW? IT'S GREAT WHEN YOU HAVE CREDIT AND YOU HAVE ACCESS AND YOU CAN DO THINGS. BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE MADE MISTAKES. AND THOSE CHALLENGES HAVE CAUSED THEM -- IT HASN'T TAKEN THEIR DREAMS AWAY, YOU KNOW? BUT IT HAS MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PURSUE THOSE DREAMS IN A WAY AS BRAD DID USING THE RESOURCES. SO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND HAVING THOSE COUNSELING AGENCIES THOSE INTERMEDIARIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HAVE. SOME OF THOSE HAVE POLICIES. A GOOD CREDIT SCORE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO A PERSON WHO IS -- WHO HAS A DREAM BUT HAS GOTTEN OFF TRACK. CREDIT WORTHYNESS. GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY AND I'LL SHOW YOU, AGAIN, WHAT I CAN DO. I'VE GROWN. DON'T PENALIZE ME. WE ARE -- WE'RE HUMAN AND WE GROW. WE LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF -- >> HILLARY: I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS WONDER WHY SOME COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY ARE SO HOLLOWED OUT. THEY DON'T HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY DON'T HAVE ECONOMIC RESOURCES AN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR IT BUT ONE OF THEM IS EXACTLY THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING BENITA WHICH IS MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE, BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DID MAKE A MISTAKE AND THEY DON'T GET YOUR VOTING RIGHTS BACK WHICH I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH. I THINK IF YOU'VE DONE YOUR TIME SO TO SPEAK AND YOU'VE MADE YOUR COMMITMENT TO GO FORWARD, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE JUDGED ON THE SAME BASIS. YOU OUGHT TO GET A SECOND CHANCE. BUT IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THERE ARE RESOURCES BUT THEY CAN'T BE PUT TO GOOD USE BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE CAN'T GET ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THOSE DREAMS IN REALITY. I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THAT. I THINK TWO, BRAD WAS SAYING YOU WENT TO COLLEGE. DID YOU COME OUT WITH ANY DEBT? >> I ACTUALLY, I COME FROM A FAMILY WHERE I WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON A PELL GRANT BECAUSE MY -- MY -- ONE OF MY HIGH SCHOOL BUSINESSES, I HAD -- I LOST. I HAD NEGATIVE INCOME. SO I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH A NEGATIVE NET WORTH. HILLARY: YEAH. BRAD: IF IT WEREN'T FOR PELL GRANTS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT. HILLARY: PEOPLE WHO TRY TO FURTHER THEMSELVES AND GO TO SCHOOL AND WIPES OUT THEIR CREDIT SCORE. SO HERE THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY THINK THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND CERTAINLY I SEE IT ALL THE TIME READING THE STORIES ABOUT THE ADS, COME TO THIS COLLEGE OR THIS SCHOOL AN GET THESE SKILLS AN YOU'LL GET A JOB. PEOPLE BORROW MONEY TO DO THAT AND THEY DON'T GET THE JOB BUT THEY STILL OH THE MONEY -- OWE THE MONEY AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED NONCREDIT WORTHY EVEN THOUGH THEY TRY TO DO WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO. IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE OF A LOT OF MIXTURES. PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ONE OF MY GOALS IS TO PROVIDE A GOOD BASE FOR SELF-GENERATED ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY, SMALL BUSINESS FORMATION AND GROWTH. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S DIFFICULT BUT IT'S REALLY WHAT'S AT THE CORE OF TRYING TO TURN AROUND A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IF WE ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON THAT. SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION ON THAT. GRANT, TELL US ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL BIKE SHOP YOU HAVE HERE? GRANT: WELL, WE MOVED IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO. STILL TRYING A LITTLE BIT. WE TALKED ABOUT USING RESOURCES. THIS WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A PARKING LOT. AND THROUGH COMMUNITY EFFORTS AN OUR LOCAL MAINSTREAM ORGANIZATION WE WERE ABLE TO DISCOVER GRANTS, START TAX CREDITS THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT GROUP TO MAKE IT READY FOR US TO MOVE IN. AND OUR MAIN STREET GROUP ON TOP OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CERTAINS THAT WE USED IN THE PAST HAS ALLOWED US TO MAKE USE OF EDUCATIONAL TRAINING, MAKE US AWARE OF UPCOMING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE CAN USE FOR OUR BUSINESSES, HAVING THAT LOCAL RESOURCE AS THEY REALLY NICE BEYOND MAIN STREET. IT'S TURNED WHAT USED TO BE A DERELICT COMMUNITY INTO ONE OF THE MAIN STREETS IN IOWA AND A THRIVING BUSINESS COMMUNITY. HILLARY: DID YOU HAVE A PREEXISTING BUSINESS THAT YOU MOVED INTO THIS NEW SPACE? GRAN: -- GRANT: YEAH, WE OWNED OUR FORMER LOCATION ON MAIN STREET FOR NINE YEARS. AND THEN WE MOVED THIS OVER HERE WHEN THIS BECAME AVAILABLE. IT'S GOING TO FURTHER OUR GROWTH AS WE MOVE TO OUR NEXT 20 YEARS OF OUR BUSINESS. HILLARY: GOOD FOR YOU. AND HOW MANY EMPLOYEE DOSS YOU HAVE? >> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FIVE EMPLOYEES. WE HIRED THREE ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES. HILLARY: YOU HAVE BIKES, BIKE PARTS -- GRANT: SERVICE. WE DO A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. IT'S OUR STAFF'S PASSION OF BIKES AND RIDING IN THE COMMUNITY. HILLARY: I WANTED TIM TO SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE YESTERDAY AT ONE OF MY EVENTS, THE SENATOR WAS THERE. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENHANCE THROUGH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY THE CAPACITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO DO EVEN MORE WORK FOR THEMSELVES OR AT LEAST TO KEEP IT LOCAL. AND BILL, DO YOU WANT TO JUST STAND UP AND EXPLAIN WHAT YOU AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY? COME AROUND HERE. BILL: THIS IS AN ACTUAL CORE FROM A 3-D PRINTER AND TO BE CORRECT WE CALL IT ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING MATERIAL. AND IF YOU'VE HAD A BLOCK OF A, LET'S SAY AN ENGINE BLOCK OR A PART FROM A BICYCLE AND YOU WANTED A MACHINE AND YOU DRILLED A HOLE IN IT THAT'S SUB STRACKIVE MANUFACTURE. THIS WAS A TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL THE PRINT OF 3-D PRINTERS AND THIS IS A MOLD GAS YUNE. YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS FREE INSIDE HERE. AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PIECES AND PUT GASKETS AND BOLT THAT TOGETHER AND ANY TIME YOU'RE DEALING WITH COMPRESSED GAS THEY HAD A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD HAVE A LEAK. IT'S DANGEROUS. BUT NOW THROUGH THIS 3-D TECHNOLOGY, THIS THING WITH THE 3-D PRINTER ACTUALLY -- AND I'VE GOT A PICTURE. I'LL SHOW YOU LATER, WOULD LAY DOWN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND ANOTHER ONE COMES ACROSS AND IT LAYS DOWN A BINDING AGENT. THEN THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN IOWA AT THEIR METALS LAB IS DOING RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THESE PRODUCTS. SO THIS ISN'T JUST FOR BUSINESS BUSINESS. DEARIN COMPANY THEY USE IT -- THEY CAN TAKE A TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF MAKING A MOLD TO MAKE THIS AND GO FROM THREE MONTHS JUST FOR THIS ONE MOLD TO OVER NIGHT. AND THE COST IS INCREDIBLE, THE SAVINGS. THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE WHERE THEY PRINTED THIS NOT ON THE MOLD. THIS ISN'T A MOLD. IT'S AN EXAMPLE WHAT YOU CAN DO. BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO GO -- IN DEALING WITH SAND TECHNOLOGIES BUT THERE'S METAL TECHNOLOGIES SO THEY CAN DIRECT PRINT PARTS. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TAKE A DRAWING OF A BIKE PART AND PRINT IT ON METAL OR YOU CAN DO POLYMERS A LOT OF OUR BRAKE HANDLES AND SHIFTERS. THERE'S A WHOLE LINE OF DIFFERENT ITEMS ON A BICYCLE THAT YOU CAN DO YOURSELF ONCE YOU HAVE THE DESIGN FOR I. SO WE THINK THAT ADDITIVE MANUFACTURES IS GOING TO ONSHORE A LOT OF JOBS TO NOT ONLY IOWA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS MORNING I STOPPED IN AT THE TECH WORK. AND NOT ONLY ARE THEY DOING WORK FOR COMPANIES BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I THINK IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- IS EDUCATING THE NEW WORKFORCE. AND WHAT I HEAR FROM SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE ACROSS IOWA THEY ALL ARE FIGHTING TO GET TALENTED AND SKILLED WORKERS. SO AS WE ADVANCE THESE TECH NOLOGIES, WE HAVE TO ADVANCE THE WORKFORCE TO HELP. YOU'RE IN CULINARY, YOU KNOW, YOU NEED GREAT CHEFS. YOU NEED PEOPLE WITH THE TECHNOLOGICAL BIKES. WE USE TO SPIN DOWN THE ROAD. I BET YOU DID THAT. HILLARY: I DID. BILL: THE TECHNOLOGY PART OF IT IS SO BIG BUT THE WORKFORCE IS BIG. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA IS WORKING TO TRY TO DEVELOP INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN HANNLE THIS BECAUSE IT'S AN EXPLOSION OF TECHNOLOGY OF FUTURE 3-D PRINTERS WILL GO TO MARS. THEY'RE GOING ON ALL OUR SHIPS OUT AT SEA BE ABLE TO FIX EVERYTHING. SO IT'S JUST AN AMAZING THING. HILLARY: WELL, I WANTED BILL, TO EXPLAIN THIS BECAUSE HERE IS AN ISSUE OF POTENTIALLY PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESS PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESS. IT'S AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF IT. WE NEED TO BE USING IT. THINKING ABOUT IT. TRAINING PEOPLE FOR IT BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS BRENT DECIDES HE WANTS TO HAVE HIS OWN 3-D OPERATION HERE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEND AN ORDER AND WAIT FOR A PART TO COME. YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY TRAINED ON YOUR STAFF TO TURN IT AROUND, YOU KNOW, WITHIN HOURS IF NOT A FEW DAYS. WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING FOR EVERY COMPETITIVE EDGE WE CAN GET. AND WE HAVE TWO POTENTIAL FUTURE SCENARIOS. ONE IS ROBOT 3-D TECHNOLOGY ALL OF THE ADVANCES THAT WE CAN SEE HAPPENING AND EVEN DREAM OF HAPPENING WILL DISPLACE WORKERS, WILL LEAD TO MORE LOSS OF JOBS AND WE WILL BE ONCE AGAIN STRUGGLING TO FIND WAYS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE DIGNITY AND PURPOSE OF WORK. OR WE CAN START RIGHT NOW WHICH IS SOMETHING I WANT TO DO AS PRESIDENT, START RIGHT NOW WITH A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD OF THE TECHNOLOGY QUHANGES A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON WHAT THAT CAN MEAN FOR SMALL BUSINESS. >> THAT'S WHAT THE TECH WORK -- HILLARY: THIS IS WHAT WE GOT TO DO. >> TRAINING PEOPLE AND BRINGING PEOPLE -- THEY'RE WORKING WITH 80 COMPANIES RIGHT NOW. THEY CAN'T FIND TIME TO HARDLY DO RESEARCH. WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING MORE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LARGEST 3-D TRAINING PRINTING CENTER IN THE UNITED STATES BY THIS FALL. SO WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. AND SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SLOWLY CUT BACK ON THE FUNDING AND STATES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO TRY TO KEEP UP BECAUSE I KNOW I FUND THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS TO MY BUDGET. AND WE HEAR YOUR STORY OVER AND OVER IN IOWA HOW THEY HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU GUYS ARE ON IT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS. HILLARY: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT FITS RIGHT IN WITH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AGENDA. I FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT. AS I LOOKED AT WHERE WE ARE IN THE ECONOMY, HOW WE CAN GAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, THIS IS THE SWEET SPOT. THE MORE WE CAN DO TO GENERAL FRUSTRATE THE BOTTOM UP SMALL BUSINESS ACTIVITY, TRAINING PEOPLE FOR THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU, BRET THAT THAT COULD BE SOMETHINGING IN THE NUCHE WOULD ACTUALLY ENHANCE YOUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY? >> I WOULD LOVE A 3-D PRINTER. HILLARY: YEAH, YEAH. AND THE OTHER THING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING. WE HAVE TWO OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS HERE. WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE CREATE CENTERS SO THAT EVERY BUSINESS DOESN'T HAVE TO BUY THEIR OWN. THAT'S A BIG FRONT END INVESTMENT. YOU CAN BUY TIME ON I. IT SHOULD OPERATE IN MY VIEW 24/7. SHOULDN'T BE A 9:00 TO 5:00 JOB. IT SHOULD BE YOU'VE GOT THE MACHINE. YOU SHOULD OPENER AROUND THE CLOCK SO THAT YOUR BIKE SHOP IN A YEAR OR TWO IS READY FOR THIS YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THE TIME AND YOU CAN COLLECT SOME OF THE PARTS THAT YOU NEED TO DO AND MAYBE ONCE A WEEK YOU GET IT FOR A FEW HOURS. YOU GET TO REPRODUCE THEM. WE HAVE TO START THINKING DIFFERENTLY. AND THIS KIND OF COMMUNAL COOPERATIVE APPROACH IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN WORK IN OTHER PLACES. THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES DONE ABOUT HOW IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN NORTHERN ITALY WHERE YOU A GROUP OF SMALL BUSINESSES. EACH ONE ALONE CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY A MACHINE OR TO HIRE A CERTAIN EXPERT. BUT TOGETHER THEY CAN. AND THEN THEY SHARE THAT AND THEY EACH GET THEIR PART OF I. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE STILL IN COMPETITION BUT THEY HAVE LOWERED THEIR COST IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT SENSIBLE FOR THEM TO CORPORATE. DON, IS THAT SOMETHING BANKS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING TO FUND? >> I THINK BANKS ARE LOOKING TO HELP FUND ANYTHING THAT HELPS OUR SMALL BUSINESSES GROW. WITHOUT ANY QUESTION. I KIND OF WANTED TO ADD ON TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING THINGS THAT HELP FUND SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAIRLY FAMILIAR AND YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION BEFORE. BUT THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION MAKES LOANS THROUGH BANKS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES ON OCCASION WITH FUNDING, YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING THE F.B.A. AND IF THEY PUT A TON OF MONEY INTO THE F.B.A. DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WHICH WAS HUGE AND WAVE SOME OF THE FEES THAT BUSINESS OWNERS HESITATE AND ACCESS THOSE FUNDS. THAT WAS HUGE. NOW WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL TIME. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING THERE ARE NO GUARANTEE FEES IF THE LOAN YOU'RE APPLYING FOR IS LESS THAN $250,000. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEAR FROM SOME OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS CLIENTS IS HOW NICE IT WOULD BE AND HELPFUL IT COULD BE IF MAYBE THAT $150,000 LIMIT THAT THRESHOLD COULD BE RAISED, YOU KNOW, EVEN UP TO 250 AND SOME OF OUR ENTHUSIASTIC SMALL BUSINESS LENDERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT RAISED 300 MAYBE 500 BECAUSE IT'S INTIMIDATING WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH SOMEBODY ON A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN THERE ARE THE ISSUES OF THE COMPLEXITY, THE PAPERWORK AS WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN THE REGULATORY SIDE AND THE TIME IT MIGHT TAKE. BUT ALSO THEY PULL BACK. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL PULL BACK BECAUSE OF THAT FEE. YEAH, THAT PUTS THEM OFF, DOESN'T IT? >> IT PUTS THEM OFF AND THEN THEY'LL STOP. IF THEY'RE -- AS YOU GOING THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES, IF IT WOULD BE A WAY TO CONSIDER THAT THAT WOULD HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. HILLARY: ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY REPUBLICANS IS THAT IT'S A GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND IT DISPLACES BANKS WHICH IS A TOTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATIONS WORK BECAUSE YOU WORK HAND IN HAND. THE MONEY BASICALLY GOES THROUGH YOU. YOU ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO MAKE THE HARD CHOICES ABOUT WHO SHOULD GET IT, UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT YOU HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY FOLLOW THE RULES. AND YOU'D HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY. WE REALLY WANTED TO JUMP START MORE COMMUNITY BANK LENDING IN OUR COMMUNITY, PART OF WHAT WE WOULD DO IS EXACTLY THAT. RAISE -- RAISE THE LIMITS TO AVOID THE UPFRONT FEE. >> ABSOLUTELY. IT'S A PARTNERSHIP. WE MAKE THE LOANS. WE MAKE THE LOANS. THE GOVERNMENT JUST HELPS WITH THE GUARANTEE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. HILLARY: I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. >> I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WORKFORCE JOB CREATION ISSUE. THAT WAS ANOTHER QUESTION I GOT ABOUT ASKING YOU WHERE DO YOU STAND ON TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. THE WRITER SAID THAT OTHER TRADE DEALS HAVE ACTUALLY RESULTED IN JOBS GOING OVERSEAS. AND WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS , THEY HAVE LOWER PAYING JOBS SO IT DECREASES THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO INSURE THAT JOBS ARE STAYING IN THE COUNTRY? HILLARY: WILL, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY HOT TOPIC RIGHT NOW BECAUSE A PROCEDURAL VOTE IS PRO SIDING IN THE SENATE. I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ON THIS I'VE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ANY TRADE DEAL THAT I WOULD SUPPORT MUST INCREASE JOBS, MUST INCREASE WAGES, MUST GIVE US MORE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVE POWER AROUND THE WORLD TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND MUST BE GOOD FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. AND THERE ARE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED ABOUT THIS CURRENT AGREEMENT. IT HASN'T BEEN FULLY NEGOTIATED YET. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINAL BUT IT NEEDS TO BE VERY STRONG ON HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RULES. IT NEEDS TO TRY TO ADDRESS EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY MANIPULATIONS OF CURRENCY BY COUNTRIES THAT WOULD BE TRADING PARTNERS AND TRIED TO RING THAT IN. THAT HAS BEEN A BIG SOURCE OF US NOT BEING IN -- AS COMPETITIVE AS WE WANT TO BE. WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS A PROVISION IN THIS, WE ARE TOLD THAT GIVES CORPORATIONS MORE POWER TO OVERTURN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR RULES THEN CONSUMERS HAVE. I THINK THAT IS A PROBLEM. I HAVE SAID, I WANT TO JUDGE THE FINAL AGREEMENT. I HAVE BEEN FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS AND AGAINST. I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE THE EVALUATION DEPENDING UPON WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD PRODUCE. THAT IS WHAT I'M WAITING TO SEE. THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS BEING PROPOSED IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO COVER CERTAIN ISSUES ARE TO NEGOTIATE A CERTAIN WAY -- OR TO A NEGOTIATE A CERTAIN WAY. >> II WANTED TO ALSO ASK IF EITHER JEFF FOR TIMMY WANTED HAD -- WANTED ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO ADD ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES. >> THANK YOU. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTICE PARTNERSHIP. IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT, BUT IT HAS TO BE LIMITED. THIS BUILDING IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. THE SENATOR FOUND CAPITAL IN THE BUDGET SO THE BUILDING WOULD NOT BE TORN DOWN. IT IS ACTUALLY A HISTORIC BUILDING. IT HAS A HISTORIC TAX CREDIT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN IOWA. THE PROGRAM AGENCY PAYS FOR FUNDS TO IMPROVE THE BUILDING. AND THEN WE PASSED IN IOWA LAST YEAR, OR TWO YEARS AGO, THE LARGEST COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TAX CREDIT IN HISTORY THAT WENT TO SMALL BUSINESSES PREDOMINANTLY. SO WE CAN DO THINGS THAT OUR PARTNERSHIP CAN HELP GROW THE LOCAL ECONOMY. I'M GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL. BUT YOU MENTIONED THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND TECHNOLOGY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. JOHN DEERE IS A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY AND THEY HAVEN'T EVEN INVESTED IN 3-D PRINTERS. TODAY, WHEN THAT 3-D PRINTER GOT INSTALLED AND UP AND RUNNING, IT HAS BEEN RUNNING 20 47. AND JOHN DEERE IS ONE OF THE MAJOR USERS OF IT. EVEN A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY NEEDS US TO HELP THEM GO INTO THE FUTURE. IN THEIR CASE, THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY DO WELL NOW, BUT THEY WILL NOT MAKE CAPITAL. THIS IS A PUB -- PERFECT EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WERE PEOPLE NEED TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I THINK IT WILL BE WONDERFUL IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAME A PARTNER IN THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE ARE SEEING THOSE EXAMPLES IN IOWA. I'M HAPPY TO SEE IT. HILLARY CLINTON: WE ARE AT A VERY INTERESTING POINT. I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS WHY THEY HAD NOT INVESTED, BUT A LOT OF THE COMPANIES ALSO ARE PULLING BACK ON NEW INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT, NEW CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SHOW UP IN THEIR BOTTOM LINE QUICKLY ENOUGH. THERE ARE UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE TO KEEP PUTTING OUT AS HIGH AS THAT OF EARNINGS AS POSSIBLE TO TRY TO GET CREDIT WITH FINANCIAL MARKETS. I'M LOOKING VERY HARD AT HOW WE CAN CHANGE THE TAX CODE SO THAT MORE COMPANIES FROM SMALL TO VERY LARGE, ARE INCENTIVIZED TO MAKE THE KIND OF INVESTMENTS FOR THE FUTURE THAT RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE TO REALLY WORRY ABOUT MAKING, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE PUNISHED IN THEIR QUARTERLY RETURN. AGAIN, I'M NOT SAYING THAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON AT JOHN DEERE, BUT I'VE SEEN ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR EVEN THE COMPANIES. TIMMY, YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING? >> I WANT TO THANK YOU, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO GOT ON MY FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND THEY WERE EXCITED THAT WE HAD SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY IN -- BRINGING ENERGY TO IOWA. THEY ARE EXCITED TO BE SEEING THE FUTURE A LITTLE BRIGHTER. I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE IT IT'S NICE TO SEE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE SAYING, THIS IS EXCITING. IT IS GOOD TO HAVE THAT ENERGY BACK BECAUSE WE KIND OF LOST THE ENERGY. I AND MY HUSBAND, WE SHOPPED ALL LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES AS MUCH AS WE CAN. THE QUALITY IS BETTER, SERVICE IS BETTER, AND WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE HELPING THE COMMUNITY. BUT YOU ARE BRINGING THEM BACK TO THE LIGHT. I THINK WE ARE SHOWING SMALL BUSINESSES, AND WE WANT TO GET BEHIND YOU AND ENCOURAGE OUR COMMUNITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. POPCORN HAD BEEN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES. THERE ARE LOTS OF GEMS OUT THERE. I THINK YOU ARE BRINGING THAT TO LIGHT FOR US AND I APPRECIATE IT. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME, BECAUSE MY GOAL IS TO HELP SET THE TABLE SO PEOPLE CAN BEGIN TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AGAIN. AND NOT GET CAUGHT IN IDEOLOGICAL DEBATES AND NAME-CALLING AND FINGER-POINTING. IT DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY. IT DOES NOT START A SMALL BUSINESS OR EDUCATE A CHILD HERE IT --. IF WE BEGIN TO REALLY PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND BUILD ON THAT, THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHERE WE CAN BE IN THE 21ST CENTURY JUST AS WE WERE IN THE 20TH. EVERYONE WHO TALKS ABOUT HOW AMERICA CAN'T DO THIS AND WE ARE BEHIND, OR THEIR IN DECLINE, THEY ARE JUST WRONG. ANYBODY WHO'S EVER BEDDED AGAINST AMERICA HAS LOST. -- THAT AGAINST AMERICA HAS COST. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN ASSUME IT WILL WORK OUT. WE HAVE TO WORK HARD, AND WE HAVE TO STAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE, BECAUSE WE DO LIVE IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE WORLD. WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND COMPANIES AND WORKERS WHO WANT WHAT WE HAVE. I DON'T FAULT THEM FOR THAT. IT IS OUR FAULT IF WE DON'T STAND UP AND REALLY PUSH BACK AND PUSH OURSELVES FORWARD. THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE I WANT THIS CAMPAIGN TO BE. NOT ABOUT ME BUT ABOUT US, ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. HE IS, I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY COME FROM. LET'S GET THEM OUT, MAKE SURE THEY ARE REAL, AND SEE HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THEM AND PROVIDE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE PEOPLE. WITH THAT PLUG ABOUT POPCORN HAD EAVEN, YOU HAVE TO TELL US A FEW THINGS ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS. >> I STARTED IN FEBRUARY 2014. IT IS A LOCAL COMPANY. WE HAVE GROWN FAST. WE HAVE A LOCATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE HAVE ONE IN WATERLOO AND VERMONT. HILLARY CLINTON: WOW, YOU ARE EXPANDING. >> YOU ARE -- WE ARE EXPANDING FAST. HILLARY CLINTON: DID YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN RUNNING A RETAIL STORE BEFORE YOU STARTED? >> NO. HILLARY CLINTON: HOW DO YOU GO TO THE BANK WITH YOUR IDEA AND MAKE THE CASE THAT THEY SHOULD FUND YOUR BUSINESS? >> I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE BUSINESS WITH OTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A BANK AND THEY BELIEVED IN HIM, SO THEY HELPED HIM. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS OFTEN THE WAY IT WORKS. >> AND SHE PAYS ALL EMPLOYEES $12 AN HOUR. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS GREAT. HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE? ASTERISK IT. CONGRATULATIONS. GOOD LUCK. KEEP GOING. ANY OTHER SMALL BUSINESS STORIES BEFORE WE WRAP UP? GO AHEAD. >> I STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS. EVERYBODY SAYS, YOU ARE YOUNG, FEMALE. THEY SAID, WE WILL LET YOU KNOW IN SIX MONTHS. [INAUDIBLE] IT WAS FRUSTRATING. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THE POINTS I MADE ABOUT THE EXCESS IN REGULATIONS AND PAPERWORK. GIVEN WHERE WE ARE WITH ONLINE EVERYTHING, WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO MUCH MORE OF THIS ONLINE. AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SLIM IT DOWN. EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS TRYING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES, SO THEY ASK A MILLION QUESTIONS WHEN CAN WE DO. -- TEN WOULD DO. I THINK WE NEED THE RIGHT TEN QUESTIONS. THAT SHOULD BE ADEQUATE THAT WE NEED TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING LENDING PROGRAMS ONLINE RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE PROVIDING FUNDING MUCH FASTER, BASED ON TOTAL ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. >> RIGHT, AND THAT'S A REAL ISSUE, ONE OF THE BURGEONING ISSUES FOR US IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THE NONBANKS, WHICH THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES, LENDING TREE. WHAT WOULD BE FROM A BANK PERSPECTIVE, THE VERY HELPFUL TO US WOULD BE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE LEVEL PLAYING YIELD IN TERMS OF HOW THE BANKS AND NONBANKS ARE TREATED REGULATORY LEE AND FROM A TAXATION STANDPOINT. SOME ARE UNDER REGULATION -- UNDER REGULATED AND SOME ARE NOT REGULATED AT ALL. EVERYONE IS AWARE OF CREDIT UNION. IT STARTED WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS FOR LOWER INCOME PEOPLE, OF MODEST MEANS. A NATURAL AFFINITY GROUP TO PULL RESOURCES AND LEND TO EACH OTHER. HAVE JUST EXPLODED, AND ARE NOT FOR THE LITTLE PERSON ANY LONGER, BUT THERE I THINK THERE ARE 200 CREDIT UNIONS LARGER THAN $1 BILLION. THAT IS BIGGER THAN 90% OF THE BANKS. THAT IS TOUGH FOR US. IT IS TOUGH FROM A COMPETITIVE STANDPOINT TO BE A BANK THAT PAYS TAXES TO COMPETE WITH A THAT KIND ENTITY, BUT THERE ARE LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXES THAT WHERE A FAIR ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE PAID. ONE STATISTIC TO THROW OUT FROM THIS STATE, THE AVERAGE IOWA FAMILY OF FOUR PAID $11,400 IN FEDERAL TAXES, $2.5 BILLION IN CREDIT UNION WITH $38 MILLION IN PROFITS, PAGE ZERO. TO ADD TO THAT,--/ >> TO ADD TO THAT, THE POVERTY LEVEL IS 24 THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHEN YOU TAKE $11,000 FROM 24? I MEAN, I'M NOT GOOD AT MATH. >> ANOTHER NOTE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TAXES. ONE THING BICYCLE RETAILERS ACROSS THE NATION, WHEN WE DEAL WITH COMMUNITY BANKS, IS WE ARE STARTING TO SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SHOPPING ONLINE. WE ARE DISADVANTAGING THE BRICK-AND-MORTAR RETAILERS THAT PAY SALES TAX THAT FUND THE CITY GOVERNMENTS, POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS. THAT IS AN UNFAIR TAX BURDEN THAT BRICK-AND-MORTAR PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY, WHERE HE KEEPS THE MONEY LOCAL. HILLARY CLINTON: THAT'S A GOOD POINT. MAYBE WHEN I FINISHED TALKING TO THE PEOPLE HERE. I WILL PUT IT ON MY LIST FOR DUE CONSIDERATION. YES SIR. >> I HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS BROADBAND INTERNET. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE SEE IS WE DON'T HAVE GIGABYTES. IN THOSE TOWNS. BUT ALSO, IN RURAL TOWNS AND ON FARMS, THERE IS NO INTERNET OTHER THAN DIAL-UP. ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT IS IF WE COULD DO A LITTLE COOPERAT IVE, IF WE COULD DO THE SAME THING FOR WIRELESS. HILLARY CLINTON: AND FOR RURAL AIR AND -- EVERYWHERE. AND EVEN SOME URBAN AREAS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE KIND OF HIGH-SPEED INTERNET THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY. IN THE WEEKS AHEAD, I WILL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO COME -- BECOME MORE F COMPETITIVE. THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVES HERE AND WHEN WE ELECTRIFIED THE COUNTRY, IT BECAME CLEAR WE WOULD DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS. THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF BUSINESS THERE. BUT IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE AND NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE FROM A PROFIT PERSPECTIVE TO PUT THE LINES INTO GOING TO RURAL AMERICA. THAT IS WHERE THE RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVES CAME IN. THEY SAID, WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE A UTILITY SERVICE THAT WILL CONNECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IT TOOK UNTIL THE LATE 1960'S TO GET EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE COUNTRY ELECTRIFIED, AT LEAST THE LOWER 48. I THINK YOUR POINT IS REALLY A SMART ONE. IF WE ARE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY, AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SMART PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS YOU HAVE GOOD IDEAS. WHEN I REFERRED EARLIER TO THE PARTNERSHIP I SET UP WITH EBAY WHEN I WAS SENATOR IN NEW YORK, UPSTATE NEW YORK NEAR THE CANADIAN BORDER, AROUND THE ADIRONDACKS, THEY HAD A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE WITH GREAT IDEAS. BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE A BIG MARKET. WHAT WE DID WAS TO CONNECT THEM AND HELP THEM DO IT WEBSITE, GET THEM ON EBAY, HELP THEM ADVERTISED ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE MAN WAS MAKING EXQUISITE FLYFISHING ROD AND ONLY SELLING ONE EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS, COULD GET ORDERS FROM SCANDINAVIA. WE NEED TO DO THAT EVERYWHERE. SO THAT YOU CAN SELL YOUR PRODUCT WHEREVER YOU ARE, AND SELL INTO THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. THAT IS WHERE I THINK WE CAN DO MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE DOING. AND WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT HIGH-SPEED INTERNET. >> 12 WE ARE COMING -- WELL, WE ARE COMING CLOSE TO THE END. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE. THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE LET YOU HAVE A CLOSING SUMMATION. HILLARY CLINTON: I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU AND EVERYONE WHO CAME. THIS CONVERSATION IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHY I LOVE DOING THIS. I ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING. I FEEL LIKE WE NEED A CONVERSATION IN OUR COUNTRY AGAIN WHERE WE ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER, TAKING EACH OTHER'S OPINION, EVEN WHEN WE DON'T AGREE WE ARE LISTENING AND LEARNING. AND WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST SOLUTIONS ARE TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE. I HAVE GOTTEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GOOD IDEAS, GOOD INFORMATION, FROM DOING THESE ROUNDTABLES. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS ONE. WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS MAYBE TAKE A PICTURE AND THEN MAYBE HAVE OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS COME AND JOIN. AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THEN I MIGHT, IF I COULD LEARN SOMETHING, I MIGHT COME OVER AND SAY A FEW WORDS AND TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS. MAYBE WE CAN GET BILL AND JEFF TO JOIN US. CAN YOU GET US ALL IN? OK. THANK YOU FOR THIS. THAT IS QUITE A THING. IT HAS MOVABLE PARTS, PRETTY AMAZING. LET'S GET EVERYBODY. IS POPCORN HEAVEN UP HERE? CLASS I WANTED TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE. IT IS A LARGEST 3-D PRINTER IN ALL OF AMERICA. THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING THAT PART INTO THE COMPUTER SO THEY ARE GOING TO PRINT THAT OUT. AND THEN THAT IS THE TABLE WHEN IT CAME OUT AND UNLOADED IT. SO HOPEFULLY YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO. HILLARY CLINTON: YES, I WOULD LIKE THAT. THIS IS PART OF WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO PROMOTE. HELLO.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?326661-1/senator-bernie-sanders-ivt-town-hall-meeting,Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) Town Hall Meeting,Bernie Sanders,"CREATED BY AMERICA'S CABLE COMPANIES AND BROUGHT TO YOU AS A PUBLIC SERVICE. >> DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNIE SANDERS WAS IN COLORADO WHERE HE SPOKE TO A CROWD OF MORE THAN 4000 PEOPLE. THE INDEPENDENT SENATOR TALKED ABOUT CAMPAIGN FINANCE, INCOME INEQUALITY, CLIMATE CHANGE AND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. THIS IS JUST OVER ONE HOUR. WELL, LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING ROBIN FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION. LET ME THINK ALL THE FOLKS AT THE ATRIUM. LET ME THANK THE MANY HUNDREDS OF THE FIELD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY TURNOUTS, AND I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. A FEW WEEKS AGO -- IF YOU WEEKS AGO WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO DO AN EVENT IN L.A. AND I SAID TO MYSELF, WE ARE GOING TO L.A., WHAT OF RECEIVED WE CAN GET A ROOM IN DENVER -- WHY DON'T WE GET A ROOM AND DENVER AND SEE IF WE CAN BRING A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE TOGETHER, SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME SUPPORTERS, AND AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER THE E-MAIL WENT OUT WE KNEW WE HAD TO CHANGE THE VENUE. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE WE ARE TONIGHT. SO THANK YOU. LET ME BEGIN BY TELLING YOU WHAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TELL YOU. AND THAT IS THAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S NOT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. IT'S NOT ABOUT JEB BUSH. IS NOT ABOUT ANY OTHER CANDIDATES. THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT YOU, YOUR KIDS AND YOUR PARENTS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS ABOUT CREATING A POLITICAL MOVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO STAND UP AND LOUDLY AND PROUDLY PROCLAIM THAT THIS NATION AND OUR GOVERNMENT BELONG TO ALL OF US AND NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY. AND DEMOCRACY MEANS TODAY THAT WE NEED A POLITICAL MOVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO COME OUT AND VOTE, WHO EDUCATE, AND WHO ORGANIZE. DEMOCRACY IS NOT ABOUT THE LAST ELECTION IN WHICH 63% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 80% OF YOUNG PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE. THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. DEMOCRACY IS WHEN PEOPLE FROM ONE END OF THIS COUNTRY TO THE OTHER STAND UP AND SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT A GREAT NATION CANNOT ACCOMPLISH. NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR THINKING SMALL. WE HAVE BEEN THINKING SMALL FOR TOO MANY YEARS. WE ARE THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. NOW IS THE TIME TO THINK BIG, AND TO UNDERSTAND ALL THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. THIS COUNTRY TODAY, IN MY VIEW, FACES MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE A GREAT DEPRESSION. AND IF YOU ADD TO THAT, THE PLANETARY CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, IT MAY WELL BE THAT TODAY, IN OUR TIME, WE FACE MORE CHALLENGES THAN ANY TIME IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHAT WE ARE HERE TONIGHT FOR HIS TO LAY THOSE PROBLEMS OUT ON THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TODAY WE LIVE IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, BUT MOST AMERICANS DON'T FEEL THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT. -- THAT AND DON'T KNOW THAT. ALMOST ALL OF THE WEALTH RESTS IN THE HANDS OF A TINY NUMBER OF PEOPLE. AMERICA NOW HAS MORE INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAN ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH, AND THE GAP BETWEEN THE VERY RICH AND EVERYONE ELSE IS WIDER TODAY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE LATE 1920'S. IN MY VIEW, THE ISSUE OF WEALTH AND INCOME INEQUALITY IS THE GREAT MORAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME, IT IS THE GREAT ECONOMIC ISSUE OF OUR TIME, IT IS A GREAT POLITICAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN BE. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN THE TOP 1/10 OF 1% TODAY OWNS ALMOST AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN TODAY 99% OF ALL NEW INCOME CREATED GOES TO THE TOP 1%. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN WE HAVE SEEN A PROLIFERATION OF MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES AT THE SAME TIME AS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES, AND WE HAVE BY FAR THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN ONE FAMILY IN AMERICA, THE WALTON FAMILY, OWNS MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 130 MILLION AMERICANS. THIS GROTESQUE LEVEL OF WEALTH AND INCOME INEQUALITY IS NOT ONLY IMMORAL, IS NOT ONLY BAD ECONOMICS, IS NOT ONLY UNSUSTAINABLE, IT IS NOT WHAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT. IT AIN'T GOING TO BE EASY. THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS CONTROLS MUCH OF THE ECONOMY, OUR POLITICAL LIFE, THE MEDIA. BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING TONIGHT IS SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS, AND THAT IS, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL. YOU CANNOT GET HUGE TAX BREAKS WHEN CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY GO HUNGRY. YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO SEND OUR JOBS TO CHINA WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR WORK. YOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR PROFITS IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND IN OTHER TAX HAVENS WHILE THERE ARE MASSIVE UNMET NEEDS IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS COUNTRY. THE UNCONSCIONABLE GREED OF THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS IS DESTROYING THIS NATION AND IT HAS GOT TO END. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTS ""BERNIE""] AND WHAT WE SAY TO THESE EXTRAORDINARILY WEALTHY AND POWERFUL PEOPLE IS THAT YOU CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE BENEFITS IF YOU REFUSE TO ACCEPT YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS AMERICANS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY, WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. WHAT WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IS THE TRAGIC REALITY THAT OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS OF AMERICA, ONCE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN DISAPPEARING. I WANT YOU TO APPRECIATE THIS. ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF TECHNOLOGY AND ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT ALMOST EVERY WORKER IN AMERICA IS NOW FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN WORKERS WERE 10 OR 20 YEARS AGO. DESPITE THAT INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE INCREASE IN ACTIVITY, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, MILLIONS ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES AND MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME TODAY IS ALMOST $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS IN 1999. THAT IS THE REALITY AND THAT IS THE REALITY THAT WE HAVE TO PUT ON THE TABLE AND WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT AND WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND. [APPLAUSE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN MY STATE OF VERMONT -- THAT'S RIGHT. I DOUBT IT IS ANY DIFFERENT IN COLORADO OR ANYPLACE ELSE, WE HAVE PEOPLE NOT WORKING ONE JOB. THERE ARE WORKING TWO JOBS OR THREE JOBS TRYING TO COBBLE TOGETHER AN INCOME AND SOME HEALTH CARE. THAT IS NOT WHAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY SHOULD BE ABOUT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE WHAT IS ON THEIR MIND, THEY TALK ABOUT JOBS AND UNEMPLOYMENT. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. WHEN YOU READ IN THE PAPERS ONCE PER MONTH THAT OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS 5.4%, DON'T BELIEVE IT. THE WEIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT DETERMINES UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IS KIND OF COMPLICATED. IF YOU THROW IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING PART-TIME WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME AND WHEN YOU ADD TO THAT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR WORK, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT TODAY IS CLOSE TO 11%. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS NOT DISCUSSED AT ALL. ONE OF THE FUN THINGS ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] A REPORT JUST CAME OUT A FEW WEEKS AGO FROM THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT THINK TANK IN WASHINGTON AND WHAT THEY SAID SHOULD SCARE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. THAT IS THAT YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY HAS REACHED CRISIS PROPORTIONS. IF YOU INCLUDE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR WORK WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES FROM AGE 17 TO 20. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR WHITE AND HISPANIC YOUNG PEOPLE IS OVER 30% AND FOR YOUNG, AFRICAN-AMERICAN KIDS, 17-20, THAT NUMBER IS 51%. MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, WE SHOULD START INVESTING IN JOBS AND EDUCATION RATHER THAN IN INCARCERATION AND JAIL. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, WE ARE ALSO NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT INCOME WEALTH INEQUALITY. WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAGES AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN VERMONT AND COLORADO ARE WORKING AT INADEQUATE WAGES. [APPLAUSE] I WAS IN DES MOINES IOWA A WEEK AGO TALKING TO SOME PEOPLE AT A FARMERS MARKET AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING, THEY WERE COLLECTING FOOD THAT WAS NOT SOLD AT THE FARMERS MARKET AND RATING IT TO AN EMERGENCY FOOD SHELF. WHAT THEY SAID IN DES MOINES IS THAT 90% OF THE PEOPLE WHO WENT TO THE EMERGENCY FOOD SHELVES WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING FULL-TIME. ONE WOULD THINK THAT IF SOMEBODY WORKED FULL-TIME, YOU WOULD EARN ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FEED YOUR FAMILY. [APPLAUSE] LET ME STATE AS CLEARLY AS I CAN , THAT THE CURRENT FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF SEVEN DOLLARS AND $.25 -- OF $7.25 PER HOUR IS A STARVATION WAGE AND MUST BE RAISED TO A LIVING WAGE. [APPLAUSE] THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DID EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING. THEY RAISED THE MINIMUM WAGE OVER A PERIOD OF A COUPLE YEARS. THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING NATIONALLY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WORK AND WAGES, WE HAVE TO AND THE DISGRACE OF WOMEN MAKING $.78 ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO MEN. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I ANNOUNCED A SERIES OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE A LOT OF FUN TO TALK ABOUT AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. AS YOU KNOW, MANY REPUBLICANS TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. THEY JUST LOVE CHILDREN. THEY JUST CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. BUT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TO EVERY WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU CANNOT CONTROL AND HAVE DESTINY OVER YOUR OWN BODY. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TO WOMEN AND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TO OUR GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IS YOU CANNOT GET MARRIED. WELL, I HAVE AND I THINK YOU HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VISION OF WHAT FAMILY VALUES SHOULD BE ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU, WHAT I THINK FAMILY VALUES MEAN. IT MEANS THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST END OUR INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT OF BEING THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH, THE ONLY ONE, WHICH DOES NOT GUARANTEE WORKERS PAID MEDICAL AND FAMILY LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] WHICH DOES NOT GUARANTEE PAID SICK TIME OR PAID VACATION TIME. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A FAMILY VALUE AS DEEP AND A STRONG AS ONE CAN IMAGINE. TO MAKE -- TODAY IN AMERICA, A WORKING-CLASS, LOW INCOME WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY. THAT MOM AND THAT FATHER WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW THEIR NEWBORN BABY. THAT IS PRETTY NATURAL AND THAT IS WHAT A FAMILY IS ALL ABOUT. BUT, IF THAT WORKING-CLASS WOMAN DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY, SHE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK IN FOUR DAYS, FIVE DAYS, ONE WEEK'S TIME. AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE FOR THAT MOM AND THAT DATA. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO SPEND WITH YOUR BABY, PAID FOR. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS NOT A RADICAL SOCIALISTIC IDEA. THIS IS AN IDEA THAT EXISTS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY ON ART. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER RADICAL IDEA. ARE YOU READY? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AND OF EATING IN A LOT OF RESTAURANTS AND I DO NOT WANT SOMEONE PREPARING THE FOOD WHO HAS THE FLU OR A SICK. I WANT TO SEE WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY BE GUARANTEED PAID SICK LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT. AND THAT IS, WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS, WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT OUR PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN, ARE BEING FORCED TO WORK INCREDIBLY LONG HOURS. I HOPE SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT OUR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, AND UP WORKING FAR MORE HOURS THEN DO THE PEOPLE OF ANY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WORKING 137 HOURS A YEAR MORE THAN THE JAPANESE, WHO WORKED VERY HARD. WE WORK 260 MORE HOURS THAN THE BRITISH, AND WELL, FOR THE FRENCH, WE WORK OVER 500 HOURS A YEAR MORE THAN OUR FRIENDS IN FRANCE. WHY DO I SAY THAT? IS THAT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE? IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE ARE WORKING INCREDIBLY LONG HOURS, HERE IS THE STORY. I WAS IN HER GROCERIES OR, OUTSIDE OF GROCERIES OR, IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT. A FEW YEARS AGO. A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME. SHE SAID, BERNIE, I WANT TO MENTION SOMETHING. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE ONE KID. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN. WHAT I AM WORKING THREE JOBS, HE IS WORKING TWO JOB VERY WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BE THE KIND OF PARENT THAT WE WANT TO BE. AND THAT STORY IS BEING TOLD ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE EXHAUSTED. SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER, AND READ IN YOUR HISTORY BOOKS, THAT 100 YEARS AGO, IN THE EARLY 1900S, WORKERS DEMONSTRATED ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND THEY HELD UP BANNERS AND THEY HELD UP SIGNS AND POSTERS AND THEY SAID THAT 100 YEARS AGO, WE ARE NOT BEASTS OF BURDEN, WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. WE WANT LEISURE TIME. WE WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH OUR KIDS. WE WANT MORE EDUCATION. WE WANT THE 40 HOUR WORK WEEK. [APPLAUSE] BROTHERS AND GONE, WE HAVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION IN TECHNOLOGY AND A HUGE INCREASE IN WORKER PRODUCTIVITY. WE ARE NOT TODAY EVEN CLOSE TO A 40 HOUR WORK WEEK. TODAY, 85% OF WORKING MEN AND 66% OF WORKING WOMEN WERE MORE THAN 40 HOURS A WEEK. IN MY VIEW, AT THE VERY LEAST, WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO AS A FAMILY VALUE IS TO GUARANTEE THOSE WORKERS AT LEAST TWO WORKS -- WEEKS A YEAR OF PAID VACATION. [APPLAUSE] IMAGINE THAT RADICAL IDEA THAT WORKERS SHOULD HAVE A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHERE PARENTS CAN SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME WITH THEIR KIDS. AGAIN, ALL OVER THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD, MEN HAVE TWO WEEKS IN FACT THEY USUALLY HAVE A LOT MORE THAN THAT. LET ME TALK, WHEN POLLSTERS WENT OUT AND PULLED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY ASKED WHAT THEY WERE CARING ABOUT THE MOST. THE ANSWER IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE FOUR LETTER WORD -- J OBS. NOT ONLY ISRAEL UNEMPLOYMENT CLOSE TO 11%, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS OFF OF THE CHARTS. PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO DEATH THAT THEY WILL WALK IN AND FIND OUT THAT THEIR JOB HAS DISAPPEARED AND THE YOUNG PERSON HAS TOPIC. IF YOU ARE YOUNG, YOU'RE DESPERATELY TRYING TO FIND A CAREER LADDER BUT YOU CANNOT FIND YOUR STOP. IN MY VIEW, -- FIND YOUR JOB. IN MY VIEW, IT IS TIME TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO HAVE A JOB CRISIS IN AMERICA AND WE NEED A MAJOR FEDERAL JOBS PROGRAM IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE SENATE AND WE WILL IMPLEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE A JOBS PROGRAM WHICH REBUILDS OUR CRUMBLING ROADS, BRIDGES, WATER SYSTEMS, PLANTS, -- [APPLAUSE] -- THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND WATER SYSTEMS AND LEVEES AND DAMS SHOULD NOT BE CRUMBLING. OUR RAIL SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE BEHIND EUROPE, JAPAN, AND CHINA. [APPLAUSE] AND IF WE INVEST A TRILLION DOLLARS IN REBUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE, WE BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE, MORE EFFICIENT, SAFER, AND WE CAN CREATE UP TO 13 MILLION DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH AS A NATION. NOT AS SEXY ISSUE BUT IT IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. AND THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE TRADE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY FOR DECADES HAVE BEEN A PROTEST FAILURE -- A GROTESQUE FAILURE FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER. [APPLAUSE] AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND NOW IS A SENATOR, I HAVE VOTED AGAINST NAFTA, AGAINST HAVECAFTA, AGAINST PER MINUTE TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA. -- PERMANENT TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA. THE FUNCTION OF THESE TRADE AGREEMENTS WAS TO ALLOW CORPORATE AMERICA TO SHUT DOWN IN AMERICA, OUTSOURCE OUR JOBS TO LOW-WAGE COUNTRIES AND BRING THEIR PRODUCTS BACK IN HERE. IN MY VIEW, IN MY VIEW, IF CORPORATE AMERICA WANTS US TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS, THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE FOR THEM TO START MANUFACTURING THOSE PRODUCTS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY, I HAVE HELPED LEAD THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE TO THIS DISASTROUS TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT THE GDP. NOT WIDELY KNOWN. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY. IT IS NOT JUST THAT THE TPP AND FAST-TRACK WOULD FORCE AMERICAN WORKERS TO COMPETE AGAINST PEOPLE IN VIETNAM THAT MAKE $.56 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. IT IS BEYOND THAT. I WILL TELL YOU A STORY WHICH DEMONSTRATES WHAT THESE TRADE AGREEMENTS ARE ALL ABOUT. AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS TRADE AGREEMENT IS CALLED AN INVESTOR STATE RESOLUTION PROCESS. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS ABOUT. TINY COUNTRIES -- THE TINY COUNTRY OF WORLDWIDE, A FEW YEARS AGO, -- URUGUAY. HE TRIED TO KEEP THE KIDS OF HIS COUNTRY FROM SMOKING. I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING. GIVEN THE FACT THAT SMOKING CAUSES A HUGE. OF DISEASES, I APPLAUD PEOPLE WHO DO THAT. PHILLIP MORRIS ON THE OTHER HAND, DISAGREED. WHAT PHILLIP MORRIS DID AS A RESULT OF TRADE LANGUAGE WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE TPP, IS WENT TO AN INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL AND SAID TO THE TRIBUNAL, WHAT BERG URUGUAY IS DOING IS HARMING OUR FUTURE PROFITS. PHILLIP MORRIS SAID -- WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BY A DIGGING CHILDREN TO NICOTINE AND KILLING THEM OVER THE YEARS AND YOU ARE TAKING AWAY OUR ABILITY TO LOOK AT KIDS ON CIGARETTES. AND WHAT THE TRADE AGREEMENT -- WE WILL SEE HOW THAT RESOLVES ITSELF. IT IS STILL IN THE TRIBUNAL. AUSTRALIA IS IN THE SAME BOAT. BUT THAT TELLS YOU ANYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THESE TRADE AGREEMENTS. THE BOTTOM LINE, VERY CLEARLY, IS WHAT IS GOOD FOR FUTURE PROFITS IS WHAT TRADE AGREEMENTS ARE ALL ABOUT. NOT THE HEALTH, NOT THE ENVIRONMENT, NOT THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO DEFEAT THE TPP. [APPLAUSE] LET ME BE AS BLUNT AS I CAN BE. IN TELLING YOU COME IF I HAVE NOT BEEN BLUNT ALREADY, AND TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT I THINK MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW. AND THAT IS, AS A RESULT OF A DISASTER LOOK -- DISASTROUS SUPREME COURT DECISION. MAKE THAT LOUD SO THAT THE SUPREME COURT CAN HEAR YOU. BUY A 5-4 DECISION, THE SUPREME COURT RENDERED ONE OF THE WORST DECISIONS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WHAT THEY SAID TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY -- OK GUYS, YOU ALREADY OWN MUCH OF AMERICA. WE WILL NOW GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. PEOPLE LIKE THE KOCH BROTHERS, THEY SAID -- HEY, THAT IS GREAT. WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. TO OWN OUR GOVERNMENT. WHAT CITIZENS UNITED ALLOWED IS THAT THESE PEOPLE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUY CANDIDATES WHO WILL MAKE THE RICH RICHER AND EVERYONE ELSE FOR -- POORER. THIS ISSUE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM IS SO IMPORTANT, IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IMPACTS EVERY OTHER ISSUE OF CONCERN. IF WE HAVE A CONGRESS OR GOVERNORS OR STATE LEGISLATURES THAT ARE OWNED BY THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS FACING WORKING FAMILIES. I HAVE SO FAR MADE ONE PROMISE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I WILL HAVE A LITMUS TEST FOR MY NOMINEES TO THE SUPREME COURT. [APPLAUSE] THAT LITMUS TEST IS THAT ANYONE I NOMINATE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR TO THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO REHEAR CITIZENS UNITED AND VOTE TO OVERTURN THAT DISASTROUS DECISION. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO SEE A VIBRANT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY WHERE WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT 63% OF THE PEOPLE NOT VOTING. WE ARE LOOKING AT 90% OF THE PEOPLE VOTING. I WANT TO SEE A DEMOCRACY WHERE EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF HIS OR HER VIEWS, WHO WANTS TO RUN FOR OFFICE CAN RUN FOR OFFICE WITHOUT EATING THE HOLDEN TO BIG -- WITHOUT BEING BEHOLDEN TO BIG MONEY INTERESTS. WE MOVED TO PUBLIC FUNDING OF ELECTIONS. [APPLAUSE] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AMERICAN DEMOCRACY PEOPLE DID NOT FIGHT AND DIE FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY TO ALLOW THE KOCH BROTHERS ALONE . THIS FAMILY WILL SPEND MORE MONEY ON THIS ELECTION CYCLE THEN EITHER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IF YOU STEP BACK AND YOU LOOK AT A SITUATION LIKE THAT, WHAT YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT, YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT A DEMOCRACY. YOU ARE LOOKING AT AN OLIGARCHIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE GOT TO STOP THAT. [APPLAUSE] BEING AT A UNIVERSITY, I NOW WANT TO TOUCH ON ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCE. IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE IN, WE NEED THE BEST EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD. AND WHAT THAT MEANS, IS THAT WE HAVE GOT TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, NOT AS YOUNG PEOPLE, IN MIDDLE-AGE PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE, TO GET ALL OF THE EDUCATION THAT THEY CAN, REGARDLESS OF THE INCOME OF THEIR FAMILY. [APPLAUSE] THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN -- AND THE ABSURD SITUATION THAT EXISTS CURRENTLY IN AMERICA IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT, YOUNG, QUALIFIED PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE OR GET A HIGHER EDUCATION ARE UNABLE TO DO SO, NOT BECAUSE THEY LACK THE ABILITY, BUT BECAUSE THEY LACK THE MONEY. THAT IS GROSSLY UNFAIR. IN TERMS OF JUST TAKING AWAY THE LATTER FOR THOSE YOUNG -- LADERDER FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE BUT IT IS EVEN WORSE THAN THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR NATION AS A WHOLE. WHAT KIND OF INSANITY IS IT WHEN WE SAY TO THOSE EVIL THAT WE DO NOT -- WHEN WE SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO BECOME DOCTORS AND NURSES BECAUSE YOU JUST DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY. AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AND WILL FIGHT FOR IT AS PRESIDENT THAT WILL MAKE EVERY PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA TUITION FREE. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS. IT IS NOT ONLY THAT IT IS GOING TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO TO COLLEGE. IT WILL PERMEATE ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION. KIDS RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE. THEIR FAMILY DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY WILL NOT MAKE IT TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THEY WILL NOT GO TO COLLEGE. WHY SHOULD THEY STUDY HARD AND DO THEIR HOMEWORK. WHEN WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT EVERY KID IN THIS COUNTRY, IN FACT IF YOU WORK HARD IN SCHOOL, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WILL TRANSFORM THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] SOME PEOPLE THEY THINK THIS IS A RADICAL IDEA. IT IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA, IT IS THE MOST COMMON SENSE IDEA THAT WE CAN THINK OF. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. RIGHT NOW, COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY, ALL OVER SCANDINAVIA, EVEN COUNTRIES LIKE CHILE, THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR FUTURE RESTS ON INVESTING IN THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE. WE SHOULD DO THE SAME THING. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION, AND HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCING, WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED AND NOT SO MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE WHO ARE TODAY BEING CRUSHED BY HER RENT THIS STUDENT DEBT. -- BY HORRENDOUS STUDENT DEBT. I YOUNG MAN I KNOW, NOT SO YOUNG ANYMORE, GRADUATED LAW SCHOOL DEEPLY IN DEBT. TODAY, HE IS STILL THINK THAT PAYING THAT DEBT OFF AT 9% INTEREST RATES. WHAT SENSE DOES IT MAKE IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME AT TO PRESENT AND YOU CAN BUY A NEW CAR AT 0% BUT BECAUSE YOU COMMITTED THE CRIME OF WANTING TO GET AN EDUCATION, YOU ARE STUCK FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AT 9%. PART OF THAT LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDENT DEBT TO REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT DEBT AT LOWER INTEREST RATES. AND WHAT IT ALSO WILL DO IS AND THE ABSURDITIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKING BILLIONS IN PROFITS OFF OF THE INTEREST RATE PAID BY LOW INCOME AND WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE DO THAT, WE CAN SUBSTANTIALLY CUT I MORE THAN HALF, INTEREST RATES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEBT TODAY. MY CRITICS HAVE SAID -- BERNIE, IT IS AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION YOU ARE PROPOSING. THEY ARE RIGHT. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD COST ABOUT $70 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. WE WILL PAY FOR IT BY ATTACKS ON WALL STREET SPECULATION. -- BY A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATION. [APPLAUSE] AS A RESULT OF THE FRAUD, THE RECKLESSNESS, OF WALL STREET, THIS COUNTRY WAS PLUNGED INTO THE WORST ECONOMIC RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS, THEY LOST THEIR LIFE SAVINGS, AND THEY LOST THEIR HOMES. THE TIME RIGHT NOW IS NOT ONLY TO PASS A SPECULATION TAX ON WALL STREET, THAT TIME RIGHT NOW IS TO BREAK UP THE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] IF A BANK IS TOO BIG TO FAIL, THAT BANK IS TOO BIG TO EXIST. [APPLAUSE] I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS I WON'T GET MUCH MONEY FOR MY CAMPAIGN FROM WALL STREET. BUT WE WILL SURVIVE WITHOUT THEIR MONEY. LET ME TOUCH NOW ON AN ISSUE WHICH I THINK ADDRESSES OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS HUMAN BEINGS, AS PARENTS, I HAVE FOUR KIDS AND SEVEN BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILDREN. WE HAVE THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANET THAT WE LEAVE TO OUR KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN IS HABITABLE. [APPLAUSE] THE DEBATE IS OVER. MAYBE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FOX TELEVISION. OTHER THAN THAT, THE SCIENTISTS HAVE ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY TOLD US THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, IT IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY AND THE EMISSIONS OF CARBON, IT IS ALREADY CAUSING DEVASTATING PROBLEMS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE ALSO TOLD US. THEY HAVE SAID THAT WHILE THE PROBLEMS ARE VERY SERIOUS RIGHT NOW, THEY WILL ONLY GET MUCH, MUCH WORSE IF WE DO NOT CEASESEIZE A SHORT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEM TO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TELLS US, AND THIS IS REALLY -- IT SPEAKS TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS CUSTODIANS OF THIS PLANET. WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT IF WE CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL, IF WE DO NOT TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEMS, THAT BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY THE PLANET EARTH WILL BE BETWEEN FIVE DEGREES AND 10 DEGREES FAIR IN HEIGHT WARMER. AND WHAT THAT WILL BILL IS MORE -- AND WHAT THAT WILL DO IS MORE AND MORE DROUGHT, MORE FLOODING, MORE EXTREME WEATHER DISTURBANCES, MORE ACIDIFICATION OF THE OCEAN, MORE RISING SEA LEVELS, IT WILL ALSO BE A HUGE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE LAND TO GROW FOOD ON, IF THEY DO NOT HAVE WATER FOR AGRICULTURE OR TO DRINK, THERE WILL BE MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLE, THERE WILL BE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT, THERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE WORK. THE POINT IS, AND POPE FRANCIS MADE THIS POINT. WHAT A HERO FOR THIS ENTIRE PLANET. POPE FRANCIS HAS BEEN. WE HAVE ONE OF THE IMPORTANT RELIGIOUS LEADERS ON EARTH SPEAKING OUT IN A WAY THAT NOBODY IN CONGRESS WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ABOUT WHAT MONEY AND INEQUALITY IS DOING TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND NOW SPEAKING OUT ON CLIMATE CHANGE, GOD BLESS POPE FRANCIS. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, WAY BACK WHEN, A FEW YEARS AGO, THE ISSUE THAT MOTIVATED YOUNG PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WAS CIVIL RIGHTS. AT THAT POINT, WE HAD FOLKS GIVING UP THEIR LIVES FIGHTING IN THE SOUTH TO DESEGREGATE THE SOUTH, TO FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, AND SOME OF THOSE HEROES THAT KILLED TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY DID. IN MY VIEW TODAY, ONE OF THE GREAT ISSUES FACING OUR YOUNGER GENERATION IS TO STAND UP AND DEMAND THAT AMERICA LEADS THE WORLD IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE DO THAT, BY THE WAY, WHEN WE WEATHER RISE OF HOMES THAT ARE LEAKING ENERGY, WHEN WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT IS ENERGY-EFFICIENT, WHEN WE HAVE A STRONG RAIL SYSTEM, WHEN WE MOVE AGGRESSIVELY TO SOLAR WIND AND GEOTHERMAL, WE CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE GOT TO FINALLY DEAL WITH. THE UNITED STATES SHAMEFULLY IS THE ONLY MAJOR NATION ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL OF OUR PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] MY STATE OF VERMONT BORDERS ON CANADA. ALL PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH CARE IN CANADA AS A RIGHT. GERMANY, SCANDINAVIA, AUSTRIA, EVERY EUROPEAN COUNTRY HAS HEALTH CARE FOR ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. TODAY IN AMERICA, DESPITE THE GAMES OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WE HAVE 35 MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, WE HAVE EVEN MORE WHO ARE UNDER INSURED WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS. WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO IN MY VIEW IS PASSED A MEDICARE FOR ALL, SINGLE-PAYER PROGRAM -- [APPLAUSE] IT MAKES NO SENSE, NO SENSE, 35 MILLION PEOPLE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. OUR HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES ARE NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD. WE HAVE A HIGHER INFANT MORTALITY RATE IN MANY COUNTRIES, WE HAVE A LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND GET WE END UP PAYING ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH PER CAPITA FOR HEALTH CARE. AND THAT IS WHY, WE HAVE GOT TO GET THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] I AM THE RANKING MEMBER, WHICH MEANS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE, ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET THAT PASSED LAST MONTH. I WILL TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE THE MEDIA FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. I AM PERHAPS THE MOST PROGRESSIVE MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [APPLAUSE] AND SO, IT SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISING THAT I HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH ALL REPUBLICANS ON ALMOST EVERY ISSUE. NOT SURPRISING. BUT HERE IS WHAT -- THIS IS WHAT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET DID. THE REASON I RAISE THAT TO YOU IS BECAUSE I DO NOT MIND, AS THE MOST PROGRESSIVE MEMBER OF THE SENATE, BEING OPPOSED TO THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS AND ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS. I ACCEPT THEIR HATRED WITH JOY. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IF THEY HATE ME, AND WHAT I STAND FOR, THEN I KNOW I AM DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] BUT THIS IS WHAT I DO NOT ACCEPT. AND THAT IS TOO MANY WORKING-CLASS, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN BEST INTERESTS. I WANT TO SAY TO THE REPUBLICANS IN COLORADO. I WANT THEM TO TELL ME WHETHER THEY THINK THIS BUDGET OF THE REPUBLICANS MAKES SENSE. AND HERE IT IS. 35 MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY HEALTH INSURANCE, WHAT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET DID WAS THROW AN ADDITIONAL 27 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF HEALTH INSURANCE. AND WHEN I ASK, BECAUSE I DO, MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, WHEN YOU THROW 27 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF HEALTH INSURANCE, HOW MANY OF THEM WILL DIE? HOW MANY OF THEM WILL BECOME MUCH IS SICKER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THEY HAD INSURANCE? THERE IS NO RESPONSE. AND SO I SAY TO OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS HERE, WORKING PEOPLE IN COLORADO, YOU TELL ME IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA THAT MILLIONS OF MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN ARE THROWN OFF OF HEALTH INSURANCE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WORKING-CLASS, MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES ARE FINDING IT HARDER AND HARDER TO PAY FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATION FOR THEIR KIDS. WHAT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET DID OVER A TEN-YEAR. WAS CUT PELL GRANTS BY $90 BILLION. AND I SAY, TO REPUBLICANS HERE IN COLORADO AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE, WHETHER THEY THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO MAKE MASSIVE CUTS TO THE MOST IMPORTANT FEDERAL AID PROGRAM FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THEIR BUDGET AT A TIME WHEN MILLIONS OF FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FEED THEIR KIDS, MADE MASSIVE CUTS IN NUTRITION PROGRAMS. DO MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS HERE IN COLORADO THINK THAT KIDS SHOULD GO HUNGRY IN AMERICA? I DON'T THINK THEY DO. I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THEY DO. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT WHO WANT TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. CUT MEDICARE. SO WHAT OUR JOB IS, IS TO GET THE WORD OUT THAT OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS TO STOP VOTING FOR THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS AND START VOTING FOR THEMSELVES. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF US ARE AWARE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS IN TERMS OF BECOMING LESS DISCRIMINATORY. IN TERMS OF CIVIL RIGHTS, IN TERMS OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, IN TERMS OF GAY RIGHTS. ALL OF US KNOW THAT A LOT MORE MUST BE DONE. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, THAT YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE WALKING DOWN A STREET IN A CITY IN AMERICA AND ARE BEING BRUTALIZED BY POLICE. THAT HAS GOT TO END. [APPLAUSE] I WAS A MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS AND WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. POLICE OFFICERS HAVE AN ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT JOB AND MOST OF THEM DO THEIR JOB HONESTLY AND AS WELL AS THEY CAN. THAT'S RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A VERY TOUGH JOB. BUT WHEN A POLICE OFFICER OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL COMMITS A CRIME, THAT CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED. [APPLAUSE] LET ME, YOU HAVE ALL BEEN VERY PATIENT AS I HAVE RAMBLED ON. LET ME CONCLUDE, LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS. I WILL COME BACK TO WHERE I STARTED. I WHAT YOU DID THINK BIG, NOT SMALL. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT UTOPIAN THINKING TO SAY THAT EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD SHOULD HAVE HEALTH CARE. IT IS NOT UTOPIAN THINKING TO SAY THAT WORKING FAMILIES SHOULD HAVE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. IT IS NOT UTOPIAN THINKING TO SAY THAT COLLEGE EDUCATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN CREATE THE GREATEST NATION THAT ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN. [APPLAUSE] IF WE DO NOT LET PEOPLE DIVIDE US BY RACE, BY WHETHER WE WERE BORN IN AMERICA OR BORN IN MEXICO, WHETHER WE ARE GAY OR STRAIGHT. [APPLAUSE] I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. IN CREATING THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] (music) >>",2015-11-07 17:47:13,2015-06-20,Denver,Colorado
http://www.c-span.org/video/?326702-4/carly-fiorina-faith-freedom-coalition-conference,Carly Fiorina at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference,Carly Fiorina,"AMONG SPEAKERS WAS CARLY FIORINA: . [APPLAUSE] CARLY FIORINA: THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD MORNING. IN MY CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY, I AM DEVELOPING A REPUTATION FOR GOING ANYWHERE AND SPEAKING TO ANYONE. AND EARLIER THIS WEEK I WAS ON THE SUIT -- ""THE SOUP."" I GOT INTO A LITTLE TUSSLE WITH WHOOPI GOLDBERG ON A CONVERSATION ABOUT LIFE. THAT WAS FUN. AND THEN I WAS ASKED THE PATIENT, WHY ARE YOU A CONSERVATIVE? I SAID, BECAUSE I KNOW -- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYONE BETTER THAN ANYONE OF US. I HAVE THE CAPACITY AND DESIRE TO LIVE A LIGHT OF VALUES, PRINCIPLES, AND MORALS. [APPLAUSE] IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN I'VE BEEN ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I'VE ANSWERED. ONE QUESTION I WAS ASKED WAS WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN WAS RIGHT TO SERVE IN THE OVAL OFFICE. SO LADIES, I WILL ASK A QUESTION, A QUIZ, CAN YOU THINK OF ANY AND ENDS THAT INSTANCE WHERE A MAN'S -- CLOUDED HIS JUDGMENT? -- WHERE A MAN'S HORMONES CLOUDED HIS JUDGMENT? HILLARY CLINTON MUST NOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE SHE IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY, SHE LACKS A TRACK OF LEADERSHIP AND HER POLICIES ARE BAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] WE BETTER HAVE A NOMINEE ON A GENERAL ELECTION DATE WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO THROW PUNCHES ON THAT LONG. [APPLAUSE] -- ALL NIGHT LONG. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, MY MOTHER LOOKED AT ME ONE MORNING AND SAID, YOU ARE GOD'S GIFT CARD THAT WHAT YOU MAKE OF YOURSELF IS YOUR GIFT. MY MOTHER'S WORDS WERE SOMETHING , THEY WERE A CHALLENGE, I NEEDED TO USE THEM. I HAVE TRAVELED, LIVED, WORKED ALL OVER THE WORLD. I KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT IT IS ONLY IN THE U.S. THAT A WOMAN CAN DO WHAT I DID, WORKING FOR A REAL ESTATE BUSINESS AND GO ON TO BECOME THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LARGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE HERE. [APPLAUSE] POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE FOUNDERS KNEW WHAT MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME, THEY KNEW THAT EVERYONE HAS POTENTIAL. I HAVE LEARNED IT OVER AND OVER, EVERYONE HAS TO GET UP POTENTIAL. -- THE GIFT OF POTENTIAL. FOUNDERS BUILT A NATION ON WHAT WAS RADICAL AT THIS TIME -- AT THE TIME. THEY WANTED EVERYONE TO FILL THEIR POTENTIAL, THAT IS WHAT THEY MEANT WHEN THEY SAID LISE AND LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT RIGHT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY BY MAN OR GOVERNMENT. WE ARE NOT PERFECT, BUT THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE DONE MORE FOR PEOPLE IN THIS GREAT NATION, BECAUSE OF THAT PROFOUND CONSERVATIVE BELIEF THAT ALL OF US ARE EQUAL IN THE EYES OF GOD AND WE ARE ALL GIVEN A GOD GIVEN GIFT. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A FIGHT WE NEED TO HAVE IN THIS ELECTION, I DON'T THINK PROGRESSIVES SHARE OUR BELIEF IN THE DIGNITY OF EVERY HUMAN. REMEMBER THE PUBLIC TEACHERS UNION IN CHICAGO TALKED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THEIR LEADER SAID WE CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE SOME MANY OF THEM ARE POOR. WHAT WAS SHE THINKING, IF YOU ARE POOR AND YOU COME FROM A BROKEN FAMILY, YOU CANNOT LEARN? THAT IS NOT WHAT WE BELIEVE. THE PROGRESSES -- PROGRESSIVES BELIEVE THAT SOME ARE BETTER, OR SMARTER THAN OTHERS, BUT THIS IS THE BATTLE WE HAVE, TO RESTORE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CONSERVATIVISM MEANS AND HOW IMPORTANT FAITH IS IN THE SYSTEM. I GREW UP A LITTLE GIRL OF EIGHT KIDS, BUT MY IDEAS WERE ASKED -- ABSTRACT. I ALWAYS KIND OF THOUGHT OF GOD AS SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTOOD ME, LIKE A BIG CEO, HE DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS, BUT ARE A PASTOR I REDISCOVERED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. I BEGAN TO THINK, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF OBJECTS IN THIS WORLD KEEP TRACK OF EVERY SINGLE THING, OF EVERY SINGLE DAY, IF HUMANKIND IS LIKE THIS, THEN JESUS CHRIST KNOWS THE DETAILS OF EACH OF OUR LIVES. [APPLAUSE] THAT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CARE ME THROUGH A LONG BATTLE WITH CANCELED -- CANCER. THERE ARE BLESSINGS ON ALL PASSAGES. THE BLESSING IN THAT PATH WAS THAT I LEARNED LIFE IS NOT MEASURED IN TIME, BUT IN LOVE AND POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS. WOMEN HAS BEEN -- WIN -- WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I LOST OUR DAUGHTER AND WENT THROUGH OTHER TRIBULATIONS, I LEARNED THAT ALL WE CAN CONTROL IN LIFE IS OUR OWN CHOICES. CHOICES OF HOW TO USE OUR GOD-GIVEN GIFTS. WE ARE AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY, WE HAVE COME TO A PLACE WHERE THE STATUS QUO OF GOVERNMENT HAS GONE ON FOR WAY TOO LONG. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE COME TO A PLACE WHERE TRUTHFULLY THE POTENTIAL OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION IS A BEING CRUSHED BY THE WEIGHT OF POWER AND CORRUPTION OF THE GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS THE TRUTH, IT HAS GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME. EVERY AGENCY HAS GOTTEN BIGGER AND GONE MORE MONEY -- GONE -- GOTTEN MORE MONEY. NOW THEY ARE DEPENDENT AND CANNOT ESCAPE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. WE HAVE BEEN SAILING -- FAILING VETERANS, THIS IS A STAIN ON OUR NATION'S HONOR. WE ARE WITNESSING NOW THE DESTRUCTION OF BUSINESSES, WHERE DESTROYING MORE THAN WE ARE CREATING, IT IS NOT BIG BUSINESS. BIG BUSINESS IS GREAT WITH THE GOVERNMENT. THE BIGGER AND MORE CORRUPT THE GOVERNMENT GETS. IT IS BETTER FOR THEM. THEY CAN HIRE THE ACCOUNTS, THE LAWYERS, THE LOBBYISTS. THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES ON WALL STREET, MEANWHILE THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY BANKS GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THE BUSINESSES WE ARE DESTROYING OUR THE ONES THAT GIVE MOST PEOPLE THERE OPPORTUNITIES. WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS WEB OF DEPENDENCE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESSES, LIKE THE ONE I STARTED IN, WHERE MY HUSBAND FRANK STARTED IN A FAMILY OWNED SHOP. THESE ARE BUSINESSES THAT CREATE TWO THIRDS OF THE JOBS IN THIS NATION. WE ARE DESTROYING OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS GOVERNMENT IN THESE WEBS OF DEPENDENCE. EVERY DAY WE OPEN THE NEWSPAPER AND SEEKING OTHER STORY, THE GOVERNMENTS INEPTITUDE, BUT HONESTLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FAILS 96% OF THE TIME, WHAT DO WE CALL IT? THE IRS SAYS SO SORRY, WE CANNOT ANSWER TAX CARE QUESTIONS, BECAUSE WE NEED MORE MONEY TO ANSWER PHONES, THAT IS INEPTITUDE. [APPLAUSE] GOES ON AND ON AND ON. AND WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT IS BREACHED BY THE CHINESE, THAT IS INEPTITUDE. I HAVE ADVISED THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, THE HOMELAND SECURITY, BUT WE HAVE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE CHINESE HAVE THEY TRIED TO TRACK -- HACK INTO OUR DATABASES, BUT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS GROWN SO BUREAUCRATIC THAT IT IS INEPT AT ITS MOST BASIC PUNCHES. [APPLAUSE] -- FUNCTIONS. [APPLAUSE] WHY HAS THIS FOR SO LONG? WHY HAVE WE COME TO SETTLE FOR THIS? THIS WAS INTENDED TO BE A CITIZEN GOVERNMENT. 80% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY NOW BELIEVE WE HAVE A PROFESSIONAL POLITICAL CLASS MORE FOCUSED ON THEIR TITLE, PRIVILEGE AND PROCEEDS THEN IT IS ON DOING PEOPLE'S WORK. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE NOT COURAGEOUS ENOUGH FOR EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. WE NOW NEED A LEADER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR JOB, TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO OF THAT POWERFUL, BUREAUCRATIC, CORRUPT, INEPT GOVERNMENT. OF COURSE, NOWHERE IS LEADERSHIP MORE MISSING -- WHAT IS LEADERSHIP? IT IS DEFEATING THE STATUS QUO. WHEN AMERICA IS NOT LEADING THE WORLD, I KNOW MORE WORLD LEADERS THAN ANYONE ELSE RUNNING, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HILLARY CLINTON, BUT I WAS NOT DOING PHOTO OPS. I HAVE SAT WITH MATT YAHOO! -- NETANYAHU, WHO SPOKE TO ME IN HIS OFFICE. I KNOW ALL OF OUR ALLIES. LADIES AND JENNA MAY, ON DAY ONE IN IN THE OVAL OFFICE I WILL BE MAKING PHONE CALLS, THE FIRST TWO NETANYAHU TO REASSURE HIM THAT PHONE CALL IS IMPORTANT. EVERY ALLY IS LOOKING AT HOW WE TREAT ISRAEL AND WONDERING HOW MUCH OF FRENCH UP IS WORTH. -- FRIENDSHIP IS WORTH. THEN I WOULD CALL IRAN, A NEW DEAL, WHATEVER THE DEAL IS, WE HAVE A NEW DEAL, UNLESS YOU OPEN UP EVERY FACILITY FOR INSPECTION, WE WILL MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO PROGRESS. [APPLAUSE] A PHONE CALL THAT REACHES EVERY ADVERSARY AND SAYS TONIGHT AMERICA WILL CONFRONT ADVERSARIES. I WOULDN'T CALL VLADIMIR PUTIN, WE TALK WAY TOO MUCH WITH HIM. WE WILL FOCUS ON REBUILDING OUR DEFENSE PROGRAM AND ARMING OURSELVES. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT OBAMA IS MAKING SMALL CHOICES, WE HAVE A LAW OF ALLIES IN THE ARAB WORLD. THEY ARE ASKING US FOR ASSISTANCE, THE KURDS HAVE ASKED TO ARM THEM, THE EGYPTIANS WANT TO SHARE INTELLIGENCE, WE ARE NOT. I WOULD HOLD A CAN OF DAVID SUMMIT WITH ARAB ALLIES AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY NEEDED FROM US TO FIGHT THIS FIGHT ONCE AND FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED SOMEONE IN THE OVAL OFFICE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS WORK, THE WORLD, WHO IS IN IT, HOW BUREAUCRACIES WORK BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T. HOW TECHNOLOGY WORKS, BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS KEY. AND WE NEED SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT LEADERSHIP IS. IT IS A LEADERS JOB TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO, IT ISN'T ABOUT POWER, TITLE, LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE HIGHEST CALLING OF LEADERSHIP WHO WILL UNLOCK -- IS UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF OUR NATION. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE OF SINCERE FAITH MAKE BETTER LEADERS, BECAUSE FAITH GIVES US CAPABILITY, WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE OF US CAN BE REDEEMED, IT GIVES US OPTIMISM, WE KNOW THAT THINGS GET BETTER, EVERY PROBLEM IS SELF-INFLICTED, EVERY WOUND CAN BE HEALED. WE NEED LEADERSHIP AND CITIZENSHIP. I THINK EVERY DAY, AS I KNOW YOU DO, PEOPLE FEEL WE ARE LOSING SOMETHING. EVERY DAY WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE, I THINK OF LADY LIBERTY. PICTURE HER, SHE STANDS CALLED AND STRONG. -- TALL AND STRONG. SHE FACES OUTWARD INTO THE WORLD, THAT IS THE WAY WE ALWAYS MUST FACE. SHE HOLDS HER TORCH HIGH, A BEACON OF HOPE IN A TROUBLED WORLD. SHE HAS A SWORD IN ONE HAND, BECAUSE SHE IS A WARRIOR WITH VALUES AND PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE MADE THIS NATION GREAT. IN HER OTHER HAND, A SCALE, SAYING THAT ALL OF US ARE EQUAL IN THE EYES OF GOD, THE GOVERNMENT, THE LAW. [APPLAUSE] SHE WEARS A BLINDFOLD, AND WITH THAT SHE SAYS, IN THIS GREAT NATION, IN THIS 21ST CENTURY, IT MUST BE TRUE, IT CAN BE TRUE, IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, WHO YOU ARE, IT DOESN'T MATTER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE OR WHERE YOU STARTED, YOU ARE IN THIS NATION, EVERY AMERICANS LIFE IS FULL OF POSSIBILITY, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.

[APPLAUSE] CARLY FIORINA: THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD MORNING. IN MY CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY, I AM DEVELOPING A REPUTATION FOR GOING ANYWHERE AND SPEAKING TO ANYONE. AND EARLIER THIS WEEK I WAS ON THE SUIT -- ""THE SOUP."" I GOT INTO A LITTLE TUSSLE WITH WHOOPI GOLDBERG ON A CONVERSATION ABOUT LIFE. THAT WAS FUN. AND THEN I WAS ASKED THE PATIENT, WHY ARE YOU A CONSERVATIVE? I SAID, BECAUSE I KNOW -- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYONE BETTER THAN ANYONE OF US. I HAVE THE CAPACITY AND DESIRE TO LIVE A LIGHT OF VALUES, PRINCIPLES, AND MORALS. [APPLAUSE] IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN I'VE BEEN ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I'VE ANSWERED. ONE QUESTION I WAS ASKED WAS WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN WAS RIGHT TO SERVE IN THE OVAL OFFICE. SO LADIES, I WILL ASK A QUESTION, A QUIZ, CAN YOU THINK OF ANY AND ENDS THAT INSTANCE WHERE A MAN'S -- CLOUDED HIS JUDGMENT? -- WHERE A MAN'S HORMONES CLOUDED HIS JUDGMENT? HILLARY CLINTON MUST NOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE SHE IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY, SHE LACKS A TRACK OF LEADERSHIP AND HER POLICIES ARE BAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] WE BETTER HAVE A NOMINEE ON A GENERAL ELECTION DATE WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO THROW PUNCHES ON THAT LONG. [APPLAUSE] -- ALL NIGHT LONG. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, MY MOTHER LOOKED AT ME ONE MORNING AND SAID, YOU ARE GOD'S GIFT CARD THAT WHAT YOU MAKE OF YOURSELF IS YOUR GIFT. MY MOTHER'S WORDS WERE SOMETHING , THEY WERE A CHALLENGE, I NEEDED TO USE THEM. I HAVE TRAVELED, LIVED, WORKED ALL OVER THE WORLD. I KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT IT IS ONLY IN THE U.S. THAT A WOMAN CAN DO WHAT I DID, WORKING FOR A REAL ESTATE BUSINESS AND GO ON TO BECOME THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LARGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE HERE. [APPLAUSE] POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE FOUNDERS KNEW WHAT MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME, THEY KNEW THAT EVERYONE HAS POTENTIAL. I HAVE LEARNED IT OVER AND OVER, EVERYONE HAS TO GET UP POTENTIAL. -- THE GIFT OF POTENTIAL. FOUNDERS BUILT A NATION ON WHAT WAS RADICAL AT THIS TIME -- AT THE TIME. THEY WANTED EVERYONE TO FILL THEIR POTENTIAL, THAT IS WHAT THEY MEANT WHEN THEY SAID LISE AND LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT RIGHT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY BY MAN OR GOVERNMENT. WE ARE NOT PERFECT, BUT THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE DONE MORE FOR PEOPLE IN THIS GREAT NATION, BECAUSE OF THAT PROFOUND CONSERVATIVE BELIEF THAT ALL OF US ARE EQUAL IN THE EYES OF GOD AND WE ARE ALL GIVEN A GOD GIVEN GIFT. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A FIGHT WE NEED TO HAVE IN THIS ELECTION, I DON'T THINK PROGRESSIVES SHARE OUR BELIEF IN THE DIGNITY OF EVERY HUMAN. REMEMBER THE PUBLIC TEACHERS UNION IN CHICAGO TALKED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THEIR LEADER SAID WE CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE SOME MANY OF THEM ARE POOR. WHAT WAS SHE THINKING, IF YOU ARE POOR AND YOU COME FROM A BROKEN FAMILY, YOU CANNOT LEARN? THAT IS NOT WHAT WE BELIEVE. THE PROGRESSES -- PROGRESSIVES BELIEVE THAT SOME ARE BETTER, OR SMARTER THAN OTHERS, BUT THIS IS THE BATTLE WE HAVE, TO RESTORE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CONSERVATIVISM MEANS AND HOW IMPORTANT FAITH IS IN THE SYSTEM.

HE IS THE 13TH MAJOR CANDIDATE TO ENTER THE RACE AND MADE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT WITH A VIDEO ON TWITTER BEFORE THE EVENT. THIS IS 30 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THAT WARM WELCOME. I HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE TODAY OF INTRODUCING YOU TO A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. HE'S A TREMENDOUS HUSBAND AND FATHER AND A GREAT LEADER OF OUR STATE AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY ALL OF THAT STUFF. AND YOU KNEW I WOULD MENTION HIS CRAZY LONG RESUME OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. BUT WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS WHY BOBBY IS SO SUCCESSFUL. IT IS NOT BECAUSE HE'S SMART AND OH, SO GOOD LOOKING. [LAUGHTER] IT IS NOT BECAUSE HE'S WELL-EDUCATED. NO, THE KEY FOR BOBBY JINDAL IS THAT HE'S ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS. [APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, THE FACT THAT A MAN WOULD SEND HIS WIFE OUT ON LIVE TELEVISION TO SAY WHATEVER SHE WANTS ABOUT HIM, THAT BY ITSELF IS A LITTLE FEARLESS. BOBBY WAS FEARLESS WHEN HE FIRST DECIDED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR AT THE YOUNG AGE OF 31. THERE WERE ALREADY A DOZEN CANDIDATES. INCLUDING THE BEST-KNOWN POLITICIANS OF OUR STATE. SOUND FAMILIAR? HE KNEW HE WOULD START OUT AS AN ASTERISK IN THE POLLS AND HE DID. BUT HE WENT ALL OVER THE STATE TALKING AND LISTENING AND LAYING OUT DETAILED POLICY PLANS TO MOVE OUR DAY FORWARD AND ON THE DAY OF THE PRIMARY, HE GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE RACE. [APPLAUSE] IT TOOK SOMEONE FEARLESS TO DO THAT. AND IT TOOK SOMEONE FEARLESS TO LEAD OUR STATE THROUGH THE AFTER MATH OF KATRINA. PEOPLE WERE MOVING AWAY IN DROVES. OUR LARGEST EMPLOYERS CONTEMPLATING CLOSING UP SHOP. BUT BOBBY STEPPED UP. HE WAS FEARLESS IN TAKING ON THE ENTRENCHED CORRUPTION. [APPLAUSE] HE WAS FEARLESS IN CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO OF OUR BROKEN EDUCATION SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] HE WAS FEARLESS IN CUTTING TAXES AND REFUSING TO TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT BY RAISING TAXES. [APPLAUSE] MOST IMPORTANTLY, BOBBY TAKES ON PROBLEMS HEAD-ON. WHILE OTHERS TAP DANCE, HE TELLS THE TRUTH. WHILE OTHERS WORRY, HE LEADS. BOBBY'S COURAGE HAS CHANGED LOUISIANA FOR THE BETTER. [APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, I HAVE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MONTH THE MORE PERSONAL SIDE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS. YOU SEE I GOT TO KNOW BOBBY IN , HIGH SCHOOL. HE WAS IMPRESSIVE EVEN THEN. SMART AND AMBITIOUS. BUT WHEN HE ASKED ME OUT, I TOLD HIM NO. [LAUGHTER] REJECTION DID NOT DETER HIM. HE WAS FEARLESS. HE DID NOT STOP. AND YEARS LATER, I FINALLY SAID YES. AND LIKE THE STATE OF LOUISIANA, I AM OH, SO GLAD I DID SAY YES TO BOBBY JINDAL. [APPLAUSE] BOBBY KNOWS THAT OUR NATION HAS GREAT PROBLEMS. BUT THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE GREATER STILL. WHERE OTHERS SEE OBSTACLES, BOBBY SEES OPPORTUNITY. WHERE OTHERS SEE DIVISION, BOBBY SEES A PATH TO UNITY. BOBBY JINDAL IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO DO THE HARD THINGS AND TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] HE IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THEM. [APPLAUSE] I AM VERY PROUD OF MY HUSBAND. ON BEHALF OF OUR DAUGHTER SEALIA, OR SON SEAN AND SLADE, I'M SO PROUD TO INTRODUCE HIM TO YOU TODAY. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING MY HUSBAND AND MY BEST FRIEND, BOBBY JINDAL. [APPLAUSE] (music) BOBBY JINDAL: MY NAME IS BOBBY JINDAL. I AM GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF LOUISIANA, AND I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 44 YEARS AGO A YOUNG COUPLE WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN ON AN AIRPLANE, THEY LEFT THEIR HOME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD TO COME TO A PLACE CALLED AMERICA. THEY HAD NEVER SEEN IT. THERE WAS NO INTERNET TO SEARCH, BUT THEY HAD HEARD THE LEGEND. THERE WAS A PLACE IN THIS WORLD WHERE PEOPLE WERE FREE, AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WERE REAL. THEY WEREN'T REALLY COMING TO A GEOGRAPHICAL PLACE. THEY WERE COMING TO AN IDEA, AND THAT IDEA IS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] TO THEM, AMERICA REPRESENTED ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN THE WORLD, WHERE YOU COULD GET AHEAD IF YOU WORKED HARD AND PLAYED BY THE RULES. A PLACE WHERE WHAT MATTERS IS THE CONTENT OF YOUR CHARACTER, NOT THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, THE ZIP CODE YOU WERE BORN IN OR YOUR FAMILY'S LAST NAME. MY DAD GREW UP IN A HOUSE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WITHOUT RUNNING WATER. IT WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE FAMILY TO GET PAST THE FIFTH GRADE. HE AND MOM CAME TO LOUISIANA BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN AMERICA AND WHEN THEY GOT HERE THEY FOUND THAT THE LEGEND WAS TRUE. THEY FOUND THAT THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA ACCEPTED THEM AND THEY FOUND AMERICA IS INDEED THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 37 YEARS LATER, MY PARENTS' ELDEST SON BECAME GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA. IT WAS THE AFTERMATH OF KATRINA. OUR ECONOMY WAS LOCKED IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL. OUR BIGGEST CITY WAS REELING FOR 25 STRAIGHT YEARS, MORE PEOPLE HAD LEFT THIS STATE THAN HAD MOVED INTO IT. LOUISIANA WAS IN BIG TROUBLE. SO WE HAD TO MAKE BIG CHANGES. WE HAD TO BELIEVE IN LOUISIANA AGAIN, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID. [APPLAUSE] WE REFORMED OUR ETHICS LAWS. WE WENT FROM ONE OF THE WORST STATES TO ONE OF THE BEST STATES IN THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WE PRIVATIZED OUR OUTDATED GOVERNMENT-RUN HOSPITAL SYSTEM. WE REFORMED EDUCATION WITH NEARLY 100% CHARTER SCHOOLS IN NEW ORLEANS AND NOW WE HAVE STATEWIDE SCHOOL CHOICE, BECAUSE EVERY CHILD DESERVES AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR A GREAT EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF A CHILD FOLLOWING THE DOLLARS, WE MADE THE DOLLARS FOLLOW THE CHILD, BECAUSE WE TRUST THE PARENTS, NOT THE BUREAUCRATS, TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THEIR KIDS. [APPLAUSE] WE DID WHAT THEY SAID COULD NOT BE DONE. WE SHRANK OUR GOVERNMENT. WE CUT OUR BUDGET BY 26%. WE CUT THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS BY MORE THAN 30,000. THAT WASN'T EASY. THE BIG GOVERNMENT CROWD FOUGHT US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THEY PROTESTED. THEY FILIBUSTERED. THEY EVEN TOOK US TO COURT BUT IN THE END WE WON. [APPLAUSE] TODAY, WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE MOVING INTO LOUISIANA THAN OUT OF IT. OUR HIGHEST POPULATION IN HISTORY, OUR KIDS ARE COMING HOME. [APPLAUSE] AND NOW, WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY, WITH THE HIGHEST INCOMES IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. A JOB FOR YOUR FAMILY. A PAYCHECK IN YOUR MAILBOX. THEY'RE THE ULTIMATE PROOF THAT YOUR STATE IS DOING THINGS RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THE STORY. THE BIG GOVERNMENT CROWD, THEY HATE WHAT WE HAVE DONE. THEY SAY THAT WE HAVE CUT THE GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ANYONE. THE GOVERNMENT BUDGETS ARE ALWAYS RUNNING LOW ON FUNDS WITH ME AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. MY RESPONSE TO THE BIG GOVERNMENT CROWD IS SIMPLY THIS. YES. I AM GUILTY AS CHARGED AND OUR STATE IS BETTER OFF FOR IT TODAY. [APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME FOR THE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON TO ADMIT THE TRUTH. YOU CAN'T GROW THE ECONOMY AND THE GOVERNMENT AT THE SAME TIME. IT IS AN EITHER/OR CHOICE. HILLARY CLINTON, SHE WANTS TO GROW THE GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON. [BOOING] WE WANT TO GROW THE REAL ECONOMY OUT HERE IN AMERICA. [CHEERING] HERE'S THE KEY DIFFERENCE. DEMOCRATS EVALUATE SUCCESS IN TERMS OF THE PROSPERITY OF GOVERNMENT. WE DEFINE SUCCESS IN TERMS OF THE PROSPERITY OF OUR PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] MY APPROACH IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS MADE GREAT BY PEOPLE WHO GET THINGS DONE, NOT LOTS OF TALK OR ENTERTAINING SPEECHES. OH, TO BE SURE, THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT TALKERS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ALREADY, BUT NONE OF THEM, NOT ONE CAN MATCH OUR RECORD OF ACTUALLY SHRINKING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT. IF GREAT SPEECHES HELPED OUR COUNTRY, WE'D BE ON EASY STREET RIGHT NOW. THE GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY, HE'S A GREAT TALKER. WE HAVE A BUNCH OF GREAT TALKERS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF TALKERS. IT IS TIME FOR A DO-ER. [APPLAUSE] I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BE SOMEBODY. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO DO SOMETHING. [APPLAUSE] OH IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT THE MESS THAT OBAMA HAS MADE OF OUR COUNTRY. EVERY AMERICAN KNOWS ABOUT IT. EVERY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE TALKS ABOUT IT. THAT'S NOT EVEN HALF OF WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT FROM OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. WE OWE VOTERS MORE THAN JUST A TIRADE ABOUT THE PROBLEM. WE OWE THEM HONESTY ABOUT OUR SOLUTION. I WILL DO THE THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT DO IN WASHINGTON. I WILL SAY THE THINGS YOU CANNOT SAY. [APPLAUSE] I SERVED TWO TERMS IN CONGRESS. I CAN TELL YOU HOW IT WORKS IN WASHINGTON. IF YOU WANT TO BE WITH THE COOL KIDS, YOU WANT TO BE LIKED BY THE MEDIA, IF YOU WANT TO BE INVITED TO THE RIGHT COCKTAIL PARTIES YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THERE ARE THINGS IN WASHINGTON YOU JUST CANNOT DO. THEY SAY YOU CANNOT REDUCE THE SIZE OF BUREAUCRATS. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO CUT THE RATE OF INCREASE HERE OR THERE BUT YOU CANNOT ACTUALLY CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING BUT WE CAN AND WE WILL! [APPLAUSE] THEY SAY THE $18 TRILLION NATIONAL DEBT CAN'T REALLY BE ADDRESSED. JUST A PART OF DOING BUSINESS SO IT'S BETTER NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT WE CAN AND WE WILL. [APPLAUSE] THEY KNOW SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE GOING BANKRUPT, BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THEY DENIED THE MATH AND PRETEND EVERYTHING IS FINE BUT WE CAN REFORM AND SAVE THESE PROGRAMS AND WE WILL. [APPLAUSE] IN WASHINGTON THEY SAY TERM LIMITS IS A QUAINT IDEA, THAT WE ARE NAIVE TO BELIEVE IN. THEY THINK WE NEED A PERMANENT CLASS, A RULING CLASS OF ELITES. IT'S SAFER TO NOT ROCK THE BOAT, BUT WE CAN ROCK THE BOAT AND WE WILL ROCK THE BOAT! [APPLAUSE] IN WASHINGTON THEY KNOW THEY WANT THE BORDERS SECURE BUT THEY REFUSE TO DO IT BUT YOU AND I CAN, AND WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS. [APPLAUSE] FINALLY, THEY SAY WE CAN'T REALLY REPEAL OR REPLACE ALL OF OBAMACARE, BUT I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO HAS WRITTEN A REPLACEMENT PLAN, A FREE MARKET PLAN, THAT FOCUSES ON REDUCING COST. WE CAN REPEAL OBAMACARE AND WE WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY IN WASHINGTON, D.C., HAS BEEN BEATEN INTO SUBMISSION, IS INCREASINGLY AFRAID TO SPEAK THE TRUTH. IT'S TIME TO SAY WHAT EVERYBODY'S ALREADY THINKING. THE EMPERORS IN WASHINGTON, THEY'RE NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES. IN CASE IT'S NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW, I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. [APPLAUSE] I AM TANNED, RESTED AND READY FOR THIS FIGHT. [APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE TRUTH ABOUT MOST POLITICIANS. THEY'RE SELFISH. THEY'RE FOLLOWERS, NOT LEADERS. THEY WORRY MORE ABOUT THEIR OWN FATE THAN THE COUNTRY'S FATE. THEY TAKE POLLS, FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PUBLIC IS HEADED. THEY RUN OUT FRONT, THEY PRETEND TO BE LEADING THE PARADE. IT'S EASY TO BE A POPULAR POLITICIAN. DON'T ROCK THE BOAT. JUST A BUNCH OF BABIES, CUT RIBBONS, DON'T MAKE BIG CHANGES, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT. IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST GOING TO PRETEND THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE, JUST MAKE SOME SMALL TWEAKS, THEN YOU WANT SOMEBODY ELSE. I'LL MAKE THIS PROMISE TO YOU, I WILL NEVER LEAVE FROM BEHIND. -- I WILL NEVER LEAD FROM BEHIND. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW SOME BELIEVE I TALK ABOUT MY FAITH TOO MUCH BUT I WILL NOT BE SILENCED. [APPLAUSE] I WILL NOT BE SILENCED IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. THEY DON'T SEEM TO ACCEPT THAT IDEA YOU CAN BE BOTH INTELLECTUAL AND CHRISTIAN. [LAUGHTER] THEY CAN'T FATHOM THE NOTION YOU CAN BE BOTH SMART AND CONSERVATIVE. THEY NEED TO GET OUT MORE. [APPLAUSE] THERE'S A BIG COUNTRY OUT HERE WITH MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND ARE NOT ASHAMED TO SAY SO. [APPLAUSE] I'D BE WARY OF A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T SEEK WISDOM FROM THE ALMIGHTY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. I'VE MET MANY SMART PEOPLE WHO LACK WISDOM, YET CHRISTIANITY, IT IS UNDER ASSAULT TODAY IN AMERICA. THE LIBERALS, THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THEIR HISTORY. RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IS NOT SOME QUAINT NOTION FROM THE PAST. IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR FREEDOM. THAT'S WHY THERE'S PROTECTION IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. I'M GOING TO SAY IT SLOWLY SO EVEN HILLARY CLINTON CAN UNDERSTAND THIS. AMERICA DID NOT CREATE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CREATED THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND IT'S TIME WE STOPPED TRYING TO DIVIDE OURSELVES AGAINST EACH OTHER. HILLARY CLINTON IS ALWAYS TRYING TO DIVIDE US BY ETHNICITY, BY GENDER, BY ECONOMIC STATUS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT FOR ME I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE DIVIDING AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] AND I AM DONE WITH ALL THIS TALK ABOUT HYPHENATED AMERICANS. WE ARE NOT INDIAN-AMERICANS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, RICH AMERICANS OR POOR AMERICANS. WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] AND WHILE I'M AT IT, HERE'S ANOTHER THING YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT ANYWAY. WE CANNOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO IMMIGRATE TO OUR COUNTRY SO THEY CAN USE OUR FREEDOMS TO UNDERMINE OUR FREEDOMS. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN EUROPE, WHERE THEY HAVE SECOND, THIRD GENERATIONS OF IMMIGRANTS WHO REFUSE TO EMBRACE THE VALUES AND CULTURE OF THE COUNTRIES THEY HAVE MOVED INTO. WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN HERE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO DEMAND IF YOU WANT TO IMMIGRATE TO AMERICA YOU MUST DO SO LEGALLY. YOU MUST BE READY AND WILLING TO EMBRACE OUR VALUES, LEARN ENGLISH AND ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] NOW LET'S DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, LET'S TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR POLITICAL SITUATION. THAT'S RIGHT, IT IS A MESS. REPUBLICANS MUST STOP BEING AFRAID TO LOSE. IF WE TRY TO HIDE WHO WE ARE AGAIN, WE WILL LOSE AGAIN. YOU'VE HEARD JEB BUSH SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE WILLING TO LOSE THE PRIMARY IN ORDER TO WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION. WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM DO THAT. -- WE ARE GOING TO HELP HIM DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TRANSLATE THAT. I'M GOING TO TRANSLATE THAT POLITICAL SPEAK INTO PLAIN ENGLISH. WHAT JEB BUSH IS SAYING IS THAT WE NEED TO HIDE OUR CONSERVATIVE IDEALS, BUT THE TRUTH IS IF WE GO DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN, WE WILL LOSE AGAIN. LET'S DO SOMETHING NEW. LET'S ENDORSE OUR OWN PRINCIPLES FOR A CHANGE. LET'S BOLDLY SPEAK THE TRUTH WITHOUT FEAR. [APPLAUSE] AS REPUBLICANS, WE'VE ALREADY TRIED TO APPEASE THE LEFT. TO MAKE THE MEDIA LIKE US BETTER, TO TALK IN POLITICALLY CORRECT LANGUAGE, TO HIDE SOME OF OUR BELIEFS BY CALLING THEM DISTRACTIONS, WE'VE TRIED TO MASK OUR CONSERVATIVE IDEALS, AND WE HAVE FAILED. EVERY REPUBLICAN WILL TELL YOU THEY ARE FOR SCHOOL CHOICE, SHRINKING GOVERNMENT, CUTTING THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE AND GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE. BUT TALK IS CHEAP. TALK IS JUST TALK. I HAVEN'T JUST TALKED ABOUT THESE THINGS, I'VE ACTUALLY DONE THESE THINGS. EVERY REPUBLICAN WILL SAY THEY WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT THE UNBORN, REPEAL OBAMACARE, SECURE THE BORDER AND DESTROY ISIS. I WON'T SIMPLY TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS, I WILL GET THESE THINGS DONE. [APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME TO LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS APPRENTICE IN WAITING HILLARY CLINTON ARE LEADING AMERICA DOWN THE PATH TO DESTRUCTION. ECONOMICALLY, CULTURALLY, AND INTERNATIONALLY. FOR THE MOST DEVASTATING THING THEY TRY TO DO, IS REDEFINE THE AMERICAN DREAM. INSTEAD OF THEIR DREAM BEING TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM TO CONTROL YOUR OWN DESTINY, TO MAKE YOUR OWN WAY, THEIR DREAM IS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, TO MAKE PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT. WE WANT TO GUARANTEE QUALITY OF -- WE WANT TO GUARANTEE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. THEY WANT TO GUARANTEE EQUALITY OF OUTCOMES. SIMPLE FACT IS, THEY ARE TRYING TO TURN THE AMERICAN DREAM INTO SOCIALISM. NOW THE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON, THEY MAY CALL THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM. OUT HERE IN AMERICA, IN THE REAL WORLD, WE CALL THAT THE EUROPEAN NIGHTMARE. [APPLAUSE] TO BE CLEAR, WE'RE NOT SIMPLY TRYING TO RECLAIM THE PAST. NO, QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, WE ARE LAYING OUR CLAIM ON THE FUTURE, A FUTURE WHERE AMERICA LEADS THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS NOT A PAUSE ANY OF US CAN RESIST. IT IS OUR DESTINY. IT IS OUR MISSION. AS AMERICA GOES, SO GOES THE WORLD. WE ARE THE LIGHT OF FREEDOM IN A DARK WORLD. IT'S TIME WE STARTED ACTING LIKE IT. I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED FROM TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT RADICAL ISLAM IS EVIL AND IT MUST BE DESTROYED. [APPLAUSE] CONTAINMENT IS A STRATEGY FOR LOSERS. BUT AS GENERAL GEORGE S. PATTON FAMOUSLY OBSERVED, AMERICANS PLAY TO WIN ALL THE TIME. AMERICANS DON'T PLAY TO LOSE. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS IT WRONG. SECRETARY CLINTON HAS IT WRONG. OUR ALLIES NEED TO TRUST US. OUR ENEMIES NEED TO FEAR US. IT IS TIME WE PLAY TO WIN AGAIN! [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT, I WILL HAVE FOUR OBJECTIVES. I WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS. [APPLAUSE] I WILL REPLACE OBAMACARE WITH A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES ON REDUCING COST AND RESTORING FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] I WILL GROW THE PRIVATE SECTOR ECONOMY BY SHRINKING THE SIZE, SCOPE AND REACH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] AND I'LL REBUILD AMERICA'S DEFENSES AND RESTORE OUR STANDING ON THE WORLD STAGE. [APPLAUSE] I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO SIMPLY JOIN MY CAMPAIGN. I'M ASKING YOU TO JOIN A CAUSE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CANDIDATE WHO WILL POLITELY MANAGE AMERICA'S DESCENT INTO MEDIOCRITY, I'M NOT YOUR MAN, BUT IF YOU ARE CHASING A DREAM, LOOKING FOR A LAND WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE FREE, AND THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE REAL, I AM ASKING YOU TO BELIEVE. [APPLAUSE] MY DAD TOLD ME AS A YOUNG CHILD THAT AMERICANS CAN DO ANYTHING. I BELIEVED HIM THEN, AND I BELIEVE IT NOW. I KNOW IN YOUR HEART, YOU BELIEVE IT, TOO. I AM ASKING YOU TO BELIEVE AGAIN, BELIEVE IN WHAT WE CAN DO, BELIEVE IN WHAT AMERICA CAN DO. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!

http://www.c-span.org/video/?326839-1/governor-chris-christie-rnj-presidential-campaign-announcement,Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ) Presidential Campaign Announcement,Chris Christie,"THIS MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. >> THIS MORNING C-SPAN'S LIVE IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY WHERE GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME THE 14TH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SEEKING THE GOP NOMINATION. WE ARE LIVE AT HIS HIGH SCHOOL IN LIVINGSTON NEW JERSEY, AND A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER SPEAKING. >> SHE TOLD ME TO STAY TRUE TO MY CONVICTIONS, WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN, AND LISTEN TO WHAT THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY HAD TO SAY. IT WAS EXCELLENT ADVICE WHICH I TOOK TO HEART. TO THIS DAY, SO MANY OF US WHO KNEW SANDY WITH HER STRENGTH, AND COMPASSION, AND HER DRIVE. THIS WOULD BE, NO, THIS IS A VERY PROUD DAY FOR HER. I FIRST MET CHRIS CHRISTIE WHEN HE SERVED OUR STATE AS THE NEW JERSEY U.S. ATTORNEY. I REALIZED THEN THAT THEY APPLE DID NOT FALL FROM THE TREE. HE SHARES A LOT OF HIS MOTHER'S SPECIAL TRAITS. QUALITIES THAT MANY DO NOT HAVE THE COURAGE OR CONVICTION TO STAND BY. IN THE INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE AS A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT, I DON'T ALWAYS SEE I TIE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON EVERYTHING. BUT I ABSOLUTELY KNOW THAT HE LOOKS THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY IN THE EYE. [APPLAUSE] >> IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE AS A LIVINGSTON RESIDENT, AS A NEW JERSEY AND, AND MOST OF ALL AS AN AMERICAN, TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY TO SHARE IN SOME SPECIAL MOMENTS TO FOLLOW. [APPLAUSE] (music) >> I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE TO A TRUCE ONE OF MY OLDEST AND MOST HONORED FRIENDS. WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT THAT CHRIS AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR OVER 35 YEARS, THEY OFTEN ASK IF CHRIS HAS CHANGED. THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE KNOWN HIM THAT LONG CAN CONFIRM THAT HE HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH AT ALL. THE FACT THAT I AM HERE TO INTRODUCE HIM IS EVIDENCE OF THAT. HE HAS GIVEN HONOR TO SO MANY PEOPLE FAR MORE FAMOUS AND POLISHED THAN I BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO DECIDING WHO WOULD BE AROUND ON POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST DAY OF HIS LIFE SO FAR, HE FELT THAT WHEN BEING WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS WAS MOST IMPORTANT. CHOOSING LIVINGSTON HIGH SCHOOL FOR TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT ALSO ILLUSTRATES THAT CHRIS HAS NOT FORGOTTEN WHERE HE CAME FROM AND WHAT A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE GROWING UP HERE HAS HAD ON HIS LIFE. THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT. HE HAS BEEN SON, BROTHER, HUSBAND, AND DAD. HE OFTEN SPEAKS OF HIS MOM AND DAD AND THE ROLE THEY PLAY IN SHAPING HIM INTO THE MAN HE BECAME. HIS MOM WAS A NO-NONSENSE KIND OF GAL. SHE MAY HAVE HAD A HARD SHELL BUT ONCE YOU PENETRATED IT AND WERE COUNTED AMONG HER FRIENDS, SHE REMAINED YOUR FRIEND FOREVER. SHE WAS KNOWN TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS AND THE APPLE HAS NOT FALLEN VERY FAR FROM THE TREE. GIVEN THE DEMANDS OF HIS OFFICE AND AN INCREDIBLY RIGOROUS SCHEDULE, IT IS ASTONISHING THAT CHRIS IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN MANY LONGTIME FRIENDSHIPS AS WELL AS FOSTER NEW RELATIONSHIPS. IT IS NOT EASY TO GET HIM ON THE PHONE THESE DAYS BUT THE GOVERNOR MANAGES TO STAY CONNECTED TO THOSE HE HOLDS DEAR. THE OTHER QUESTION I AM OFTEN ASKED IS IF I KNEW HE WOULD HAVE A SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE. THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS A RESOUNDING YES. STARTING BACK IN HIS DAYS AT HERITAGE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, CHRIS'S INTEREST IN HELPING AND ADVOCATING OR OTHERS WAS EVIDENT. HE WAS ELECTED CLASS PRESIDENT EVERY YEAR HE WAS HERE AT LIVINGSTON HIGH SCHOOL AND WENT ON TO BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE. DURING OUR SOPHOMORE YEAR AT DELAWARE, CHRIS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE DELAWARE STATE LEGISLATURE. WATCHING HIM SPEAK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ADVOCATE FORCEFULLY ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS AND UNIVERSITIES PROGRAMS WHEN HE WAS ONLY 19 YEARS OLD, SOLIDIFIED IN MY MIND THAT HE WOULD BE A POWERFUL VOICE FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. I SAW THAT CLOSE HIS PASSION FOR IMPROVING THE LIVES OF STUDENTS. HE ENCOURAGED EVERYONE NO MATTER OF THE BACKGROUND FOR ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE TO BRING THEIR TALENTS FORWARD. HE THOUGHT OUT WAYS TO DEEPEN THEIR PARTICIPATION AND UNIVERSITY LIFE AND GOVERNMENT. THE CAMPUS ACTION QUALITY HAD A SOLID PLATFORM AND A SECRET WEAPON. OUR CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY, MARY PAT FOSTER. WORKING WITH CHRIS AND MARY PAT ON BEHALF OF OUR FELLOW STUDENTS WAS MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT AN INCREDIBLE TEAM CHRIS AND MARY PAT ARE. IT WAS A FORESHADOWING OF GREAT THINGS TO COME FOR BOTH OF THEM. WHEN CHRIS AND MARY PAT FIRST GOT MARRIED, THEY LIVED IN A TINY APARTMENT OVER A LIQUOR STORE. LIKE MANY YOUNG COUPLES, THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF SPARE CASH. CHRIS WAS STILL IN LAW SCHOOL, MARY HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGHS -- COLLEGE AND IS WORKING AT HER FIRST JOB. OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, CHRIS AND MARY PAT HAD BUILT THAT GREAT LIFE AND NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THEY HAVE HELPED, AS OTHER FAMILIES IN NEW JERSEY TO DO THE SAME. WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO THE SAME FOR FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. (music) >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CHRIS CHRISTIE. GOV. CHRISTIE: THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEW JERSEY. AND THANK YOU TO LIVINGSTON. LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST WEEK WHY HERE? WHY HERE? BECAUSE EVERYTHING STARTED HERE FOR ME. THE FRIENDS, THE FAMILY, AND THE LOVE THAT I HAVE ALWAYS FELT FOR AND FROM THIS COMMUNITY. WHEN I DECIDED TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THERE WAS NOT ANY CHOICE. I HAD TO COME HOME AND LIVINGSTON'S HOME FOR ME. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: I WANT TO THANK SHEILA, A GOOD FRIEND OF MY MOM AND A WONDERFUL REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS TOWN FOR WELCOMING US HERE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND, YOU MAY BE CONFUSED, YOU MAY THINK SHE WAS BEING BOOED BY HER HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATES, SHE WAS NOT. FOR REASONS THAT I WILL NOT EXPLAIN, LINZ NICKNAME IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS THE JUICE. HENCE, IT IS NOT A BOOM, IT IS THE JUICE. AND LYNN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I AM ALSO HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE MY FAMILY RAISED MEAT. YOU WILL -- ME. YOU WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT ME FROM MY MOTHER AND FATHER AND YOU MUST KNOW FOR GOOD OR BAD THAT WHERE COME FROM IS OUR PARENTS. YOU HEARD SHEILA AND LYNN BOTH TALK ABOUT MY MOM TODAY. I AM HERE IN LIVINGSTON BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO, MY MOTHER AND FATHER BECAME THE FIRST OF EITHER OF THEIR FAMILIES TO LEAVE THE CITY OF NEWARK AND COME HERE. MY MOM IS NOT WITH US TODAY BUT I FEEL HER. MY DAD IS WITH ME HERE TODAY AND I AM REALLY PRIVILEGED TO HAVE HIM. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: THEY RAISED MY BROTHER AND I COME UP BROUGHT US HERE TO LIVINGSTON WHEN WE WERE FOUR YEARS OLD AND TWO YEARS OLD AND THEN OUR SISTER DON JOINED US A FEW YEARS LATER -- OUR SISTER DAWN. THIS IS WHERE WE PLAYED ON, THIS IS THE SCHOOL WE BUILT OUR FRIENDS WITH AND CAME AND LEARNED WITH. AND UP UNTIL I LEFT TO SHARE A ROOM WITH MARY PAT, IT WAS A SMOOTH TRANSITION. AND MY SISTER DAWN AND TODD ARE AS BIG A PART OF TODAY AS ANYBODY ELSE AND THEY ARE BOTH HERE AND I LOVE THEM BOTH. [APPLAUSE] EVERYONE THINKS I'M THE POLITICIAN IN THE FAMILY. WE DID A COIN FLIP ONLY GOT MARRIED. I CALLED TALES, TALES NEVER FAILS TO I'M THE GUY WHO RAN. A POLITICIAN JUST AS GOOD AS ME AND THE FAMILY IS THE WOMAN I MET ALL THE YEARS AGO AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE FROM A FAMILY OF 10 PEOPLE. PEOPLE SAY WHY ARE YOU SHOUT -- SHY IN A CROWD? YOU SHOULD SEE THE FAMILY I MARRIED TO. MY WIFE HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC PART OF EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE WITH MY LIFE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS./ SHE IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOUR AMAZING PEOPLE THAT YOU SEE STANDING HERE WITH HER. [APPLAUSE] EVER SINCE I HAVEN'T GOVERNOR I HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO USE THE VETO AT HOME AS WELL. SO FAR SO GOOD I HAVE NOT BEEN OVERWRITTEN THERE. I AM GLAD THEY ARE HERE TODAY AND FOR ANDREW AND SARAH AND PATRICK AND BRIDGET, I COULD NOT BE PROUDER OF YOUR CHILDREN -- FOUR CHILDREN AS I TOLD YOU MY PARENTS MOVED TO LIVINGSTON AND THEY MOVED TO LIVINGSTON TO MAKE THIS PART OF THEIR FULFILLMENT OF THEIR DREAMS. OF THEIR VERSION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. THEY BOTH LOST THEIR FATHERS AT A YOUNG AGE. THEY WERE RAISED BY EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG WOMEN. UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. MY DAD, ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS IN HIS HIGH SCHOOL CLASS, ADMITTED TO COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY BECAUSE HIS FATHER PASSED AWAY, HE COULD NOT GO. THEY DID HAVE THE MONEY. HE WENT TO WORK AND GOT DRAFTED INTO THE ARMY AND CAME HOME. HE WENT TO WORK AT THE BREYERS ICE CREAM PLANT IN NORTH NEW JERSEY. HE THEN DECIDED, AFTER HE MET MY MOTHER, THAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO MAKE MORE OF HIS LIFE. HE WENT TO SCHOOL AT NIGHT AT RUTGERS FOR SIX YEARS WHILE WORKING AT THOSE JOBS DURING THE DAY, TO GET HIS DEGREE IN ACCOUNTING AND MY MOTHER, ONE OF THE PROUDEST PICTURES SHE HAD WAS THE ONE SHE CALLED OUR FIRST FAMILY PICTURE. IT WAS MY MOM AND DAD ON THE SAME DAY THAT HE GRADUATED FROM RUTGERS IN JUNE OF 1962. THE FIRST PERSON IN EITHER OF THE FAMILIES TO EVER GET A COLLEGE DEGREE. IT WAS THE FIRST FAMILY PICTURE BECAUSE SHE WAS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITH ME. THE SMILES ON BOTH OF THEIR FACES THAT THEY WERE INDICATIVE OF WHAT NOT THAT THEY HAD ACCOMPLISHED, BUT WHAT THEY SAW COMING AHEAD OF THEM. THEIR SMILES WERE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT NOTHING WAS OUT OF REACH FOR THEM NOW. THEY HAD EACH OTHER, THEY WERE BUILDING A FAMILY, THEY WORKED TOGETHER, AND THEN WITH THE HELP OF THOSE STRONG WOMEN, THEY GAVE THEM $5,000 EACH, WITH ALL THE MONEY THEY HAD IN THE WORLD, TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT ON A HOUSE IN THIS TOWN TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN A CHANCE TO TAKE THE DREAM THEY HAD STARTED TO BUILD AND TO MAKE IT EVEN BIGGER AND EVEN BETTER. I NOT ONLY THINK ABOUT MY MOM AND DAD TODAY, I THINK ABOUT MY TWO GRANDMOTHERS. WOMEN WHO RAISED CHILDREN LARGELY ON THEIR OWN, WOMEN WHO KNEW HOW TO WORK HARD, AND KNEW THAT THEIR HARD WORK WOULD DELIVER SOMETHING FOR THEIR CHILDREN. I KNOW THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE WATCHING DOWN TODAY AND THAT PART OF TODAY IS THE FULFILLMENT OF THEIR DREAM AS WELL. I AM THINKING ABOUT BOTH OF THEM. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: ONE OF THE THINGS MY MOTHER ALWAYS USED TO SAY WAS IF YOU WORK HARD ENOUGH, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING. SHE SAID GOD HAS GIVEN YOU SO MANY GIFTS, IF YOU JUST WORK HARD ENOUGH, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING. THAT STORY IS PROOF, PARENTS WHO CAME FROM NEARLY NOTHING, EXCEPT FOR THAT HARD WORK. PARENTS THAT BROUGHT LITTLE TO THEIR MARRIAGE EXCEPT FOR THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER AND HARD WORK. THAT HARD WORK NOT ONLY PRODUCED A GREAT LIFE FOR ME AND MY BROTHER AND SISTER, BUT THINK ABOUT HOW AMAZING THIS COUNTRY IS, THAT ONE GENERATION REMOVED FROM THE GUY WHO WAS WORKING ON THE FLOOR OF THE PLANT OF THE BREYERS ICE CREAM PLANT, HIS SON IS THE TWO-TERM GOVERNOR OF THE STATE THAT HE WAS BORN AND RAISED IN. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: THAT IS NOT ONLY WHAT MY PARENTS HAVE DONE FOR ME, BUT IT IS WHAT NEW JERSEY HAS DONE FOR US. THIS PLACE THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ETHNICALLY DIVERSE STATE IN THE COUNTRY. THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED STATE IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND WE ARE ALL TOP OF EACH OTHER IN PLACES LIKE THIS GEM. [LAUGHTER] GOV. CHRISTIE: WHAT HAS COME FROM THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE BELIEF THAT NOT ONLY CAN ALL OF US ACHIEVE WHATEVER DREAM YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE BECAUSE OF THE PLACE WHERE RELIVE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES IT GIVES US, BUT THAT WE NOT ONLY CAN DO IT TOGETHER BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER. WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WORK TOGETHER, THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN, NOT AGAINST EACH OTHER. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR SIX YEARS AGO, WE HAD A STATE THAT WAS AN ECONOMIC CALAMITY AND $11 BILLION DEFICIT ON A $29 BILLION BUDGET, A STATE THAT HAD A TAXES AND FEES RATES RAISED A HUNDRED 15 TIMES IN THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE BECAME GOVERNOR, A STATE THAT NO LONGER BELIEVED THAT ANY ONE PERSON COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE AND SO WE ROLLED UP OUR SLEEVES AND WENT TO WORK AND BALANCE THIS BUDGET. WE HAVE REFUSED TO RAISE TAXES ON THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE FOR SIX YEARS. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: WE MADE THE HARD DECISIONS THAT HAD TO BE MADE TO IMPROVE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO REFORM PENSIONS AND HEALTH BENEFITS TO CONTINUE THAT FIGHT TODAY, WE HAVE STOOD TOGETHER AGAINST EACH AND EVERY PERSON, EVERY CYNIC WHO SAID WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME? THE STATE IS NOT GOVERNABLE, THE LAST X YEARS WE PROVED NOT ONLY CAN YOU GOVERN THE STATE, YOU CAN LEAVE IT TO A BETTER DAY AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: AND NOW WE FACE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOT ANGRY. WHEN I HEAR THE MEDIA SAY OUR COUNTRY IS ANGRY I KNOW THEY ARE WRONG. LAST YEAR I WANT TO 37 DIFFERENT STATES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IN ONE YEAR. I MET PEOPLE IN EVERY CORNER OF AMERICA. THEY ARE NOT ANGRY. AMERICANS ARE NOT ANGRY. AMERICANS ARE FILLED WITH ANXIETY. THEY ARE FILLED WITH ANXIETY BECAUSE THEY LOOK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND THEY SEE A GOVERNMENT THAT NOT ONLY DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE, IT DOESN'T EVEN TALK TO ITSELF. IT DOESN'T EVEN PRETEND TO WORK. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHO IGNORES THE CONGRESS AND A CONGRESS THAT IGNORES THE PRESIDENT. WE NEED A GOVERNMENT AND WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT REMEMBERS YOU WENT THERE TO WORK FOR US, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING] GOV. CHRISTIE: BOTH PARTIES HAVE FAILED OUR COUNTRY. BOTH PARTIES HAVE STOOD IN THE CORNER AND HELD THEIR BREATH WAITING GET THEIR WAY, OATH HAVE LED US TO BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY, THAT WAS BUILT ON COMPROMISE, THAT SOMEHOW COMPROMISES A DIRTY WORD. IF WASHINGTON AND ADAMS AND JEFFERSON HAD BELIEVED THAT WAS A DIRTY WORD WE WOULD STILL BE UNDER THE CROWN OF ENGLAND. THIS DYSFUNCTION, THIS LACK OF LEADERSHIP, HAS LED TO AN ECONOMY THAT IS WEAK AND HAS NOT RECOVERED THE WAY IT SHOULD. IT HAS LED TO AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT IS 27TH IN MATH AND 24TH IN SCIENCE. IT HAS LED US TO WEAK LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD, WHERE OUR FRIENDS CAN NO LONGER TRUST US AND OUR ADVERSARIES THE LONGER FEAR US. THIS WEAKNESS AND INDECISIVENESS IN THE OVAL OFFICE HAS SENT AWAY WAY OF ANXIETY DRUG COUNTRY BUT I AM HERE TO SAY THAT ANXIETY CAN BE SWEPT AWAY. WE CAN FIND THE DECISIVENESS TO LEAD AMERICA AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: WE JUST NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO CHOOSE. WE JUST NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND SAY ENOUGH. WE NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE CHART A NEW PATH FOR AMERICA. AMERICA KNOWS THAT AND KNOWS WHERE WE NEED TO GO. IT MUST START WITH THIS. WE MUST TELL EACH OTHER THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SOLUTIONS BUT IF WE TELL EACH OTHER THE TRUTH, WE RECOGNIZE THAT TRUTH AND HARD DECISIONS TODAY WILL LEAD TO GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY TOMORROW FOR EVERY AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: WHAT ARE THOSE TRUTHS ARE THAT WE HAVE TO IGNORE KNOWLEDGE GOVERNMENT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE FOR US. WE HAVE TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD AND ACKNOWLEDGED IT IS THE FAULT OF OUR BICKERING LEADERS AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WHO NO LONGER LISTEN TO US AND NO LONGER KNOW THEY ARE SUPPOSED BE SERVING US. WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THAT ANXIETY AND THOSE FAILURES ARE NOT THE END. THERE THE BEGINNING. THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. WHAT WE NEED TO DECIDE IS THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THAT WE CAN STAND UP AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY I LOVE THE JOB I HAVE. THAT'S WHY I LOVE MY JOB AS GOVERNOR BECAUSE KIDS ASK ME ALL THE TIME, THE FOURTH-GRADER SUCCUMBED TO THE STATE HOUSE EVERY WEEK, THEY ASKED ME ONE, WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR. ALWAYS. SECOND, THEY ASKED ME WHAT'S THE BEST PART OF YOUR JOB? IOWA'S TELL THEM THAT IT'S THAT I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING KNOWING THAT I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING GREAT. I DON'T DO SOMETHING GREAT EVERYDAY BECAUSE I'M HUMAN BUT EVERY MORNING I WAKE UP WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING GREAT. THAT'S WHY THIS JOB IS A GREAT JOB AND THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS AN EVEN GREATER JOB FOR A GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE SPENT THE LAST 13 YEARS OF MY LIFE AS U.S. ATTORNEY AND GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, FIGHTING FOR FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. THAT FIGHT HAS NOT MADE ME MORE WEARY, IT HAS MADE ME STRONGER AND I AM NOW READY TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AMERICA IS TIRED OF HANDWRINGING AND EVASIVENESS AND WEAKNESS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. WE NEED STRENGTH AND DECISION-MAKING AND AUTHORITY BACK IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND THAT IS WHY TODAY I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] GOV. CHRISTIE: AND NOW, AS LIVINGSTON AND NEW JERSEY TURNS ITS GAZE TO THE WEST BEST REST OF AMERICANS, WHAT DO WE SEE AND WHAT CAN WE CONFRONT? WE NEED A CAMPAIGN OF BIG IDEAS AND HARD TROOPS AND REAL OPPORTUNITIES -- HARD TRUTHS ANDRIY OPPORTUNITIES. WE NEED TO FIX THE BROKEN ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM, WE HAVE CANDIDATES WHO SAY WE CAN'T CONFRONT THIS BECAUSE IF WE DO WE WILL BE LYING AND STEALING FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. LET ME FILL EVERYBODY ELSE IN, THE LYING AND STEALING HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. THE HORSE IS OUT OF THE BARN. YOU CAN ONLY GET BACK IN BY FORCE. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GET OUR ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN AT 4% OR GREATER AND THE REASON WE DO IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS ONCE AGAIN THE COUNTRY MY MOTHER AND FATHER TOLD ME IT WAS. AS HARD AS YOU WORK, THAT IS AS HIGH AS YOU WILL RISE. THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE, WE CANNOT HONESTLY LOOK AT OUR CHILDREN AND SAY THAT TO THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT IS WEAK AND DOESN'T PRESENT THEM WITH THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT MARY PAT AND I WERE PRESENTED IN THE MID-1980'S ONLY GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE. WHEN WE GRADUATED, WE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING A JOB, WE WORRIED UP PICKING WHICH JOB WAS THE BEST FOR US. WE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT WHETHER WE WERE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE KNOW WE WORKED HARD WE WOULD. THIS COUNTRY AND ITS LEADERSHIP DOES THE SAME THING TO MY CHILDREN AND YOURS AND I AM READY TO GIVE IT TO YOU. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: WE NEED A TAX SYSTEM THAT IS SIMPLIFIED AND WILL PUT CPAS LIKE MY DAD OUT OF BUSINESS. WE NEED TO GET GOVERNMENT OFF THE BACK OF OUR PEOPLE AND BUSINESS REGULATION AND ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN AMERICA AGAIN, NOT OVERSEAS. INVEST IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR PEOPLE. AND IN A WORLD THAT IS AS DANGEROUS AND AS FRIGHTENING AS ANYTIME I'VE SEEN IT AND MY LIFETIME. THERE IS ONLY ONE INDISPENSABLE FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD. IT IS A STRONG, UNEQUIVOCAL AMERICA THAT WILL LEAD THE WORLD AND NOT BE AFRAID TO TELL US WE WILL BE WITH YOU NO MATTER WHAT AND UNTIL OUR ADVERSARIES THERE ARE LIMITS TO YOUR CONDUCT AND AMERICA WILL ENFORCE THE LIMITS TO THAT CONDUCT. [APPLAUSE] [NO AUDIO] [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: HERE IT COMES, AFTER SEVEN YEARS, I HEARD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAY THAT THE WORLD RESPECT AMERICA MORE BECAUSE OF HIS LEADERSHIP. THIS CONVINCES ME IT IS THE FINAL CONFIRMATION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA LIVES IN HIS OWN WORLD, NOT IN HOURS. -- OURS. AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF A WEEK AND FECKLESS FOREIGN POLICY RUN BY BARACK OBAMA, WE BETTER NOT TURN IT OVER TO HIS SECOND MATE, HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: IN THE END, LEADERSHIP MATTERS. IT MATTERS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND AMERICAN LEADERSHIP MATTERS FOR THE WORLD. IF WE ARE GOING TO LEAD, WE HAVE TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT BEING LOVED AND START WORRYING ABOUT A RESPECTED AGAIN BOTH AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS A SURROGATE FOR THE ELECTED PROM KING OF AMERICA. I AM NOT LOOKING TO BE THE MOST POPULAR GUY WHO LOOKS IN YOUR EYES EVERY DAY AND SAYS WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR AND TURN AROUND AND DO SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN I STAND UP ON ESTATES LIKE THIS IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU, THERE IS ONE THING YOU WILL KNOW FOR SURE. I MEAN WHAT I SAY AND I SAY WHAT I MEAN AND THAT IS WHAT AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE WHO OFFER THEMSELVES FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN 2016, YOU WON'T HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER I CAN DO IT OR NOT. IN NEW JERSEY AS GOVERNOR, I HAVE STOOD UP AGAINST ECONOMIC CALAMITY AND UNPRECEDENTED NATURAL DISASTER, WE HAVE BROUGHT OURSELVES TOGETHER AND PUSHED BACK THAT ECONOMIC CALAMITY AND WE ARE RECOVERING FROM THAT NATURAL DISASTER AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE LEAD AND WORK TOGETHER TO DO IT. AS GOVERNOR I HAVE PROVEN THAT YOU CAN STAND UP AND FIGHT THE MOST POWERFUL SPECIAL INTEREST THIS STATE HAS TO HAVE AND STAND UP AND STOP THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME REACH ACROSS THE AISLE TO OUR FRIENDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND SAY IF YOU HAVE A GOOD IDEA, I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: AS GOVERNOR I NEVER WAVERED FROM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH AS I SEE IT AND THEN ACTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THE TRUTH AS I BELIEVE IT IN MY HEART. AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, I WANT TO PROMISE YOU A FEW THINGS. FIRST, A CAMPAIGN WITHOUT SPIN AND WITHOUT PANDERING OR FOCUS GROUP TESTED ANSWERS. YOU GET WHAT I THINK WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT OR WHETHER IT MAKES YOU CRINGE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. A CAMPAIGN WHEN I'M ASKED A QUESTION, I WILL GIVE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ASKED, NOT THE ANSWER MY POLITICAL CONSULTANTS TOLD ME TO GET BACKSTAGE. A CAMPAIGN THAT, EVERY DAY, WILL NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AS POPULAR BUT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT. WHAT IS RIGHT WILL FIX AMERICA, NOT WHAT IS POPULAR. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: A CAMPAIGN THAT BELIEVES IN AMERICA THAT IS AS GREAT AS THE HOPES AND DREAMS THAT WE WANT EVERYONE OF OUR CHILDREN TO HAVE. NOT A CAMPAIGN THAT TEARS PEOPLE DOWN, BUT A CAMPAIGN THAT REBUILDS AMERICA AS A PLACE WHERE YOU AND I GREW UP AND WHERE WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO GROW UP IN AGAIN AND WHERE WE WANT FREE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO GROW UP IN AN THEIR COUNTRIES AS WELL. THAT'S WHAT AMERICA HAS A WASTED FOR AND THAT'S WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN WILL STAND FOR. -- THAT'S WHAT AMERICA HAS STANDED FOR. ALL THE SIGNS SAY TELL IT IS. WE'RE GOING TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS TODAY SO THAT WE CAN CREATE GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN TOMORROW. THE TRUTH WILL SET US FREE, EVERYBODY. [APPLAUSE] GOV. CHRISTIE: ALL THE YEARS, ALL 52 YEARS THAT I HAVE SPENT IN THE STATE WITH OUR PEOPLE, HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS MOMENT. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE AND HOW THIS JOURNEY WILL END. BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY, ONLY IN AMERICA, WHERE SOMEONE LIKE ME COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE HIGHEST OFFICE THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER. ONLY IN AMERICA COULD ALL OF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR VOICES AND YOUR EFFORTS COULD MAKE IT DIFFERENT, TO CHANGE A COUNTRY AS BIG AND FAST AS POWERFUL AS THIS ONE. ONLY IN AMERICA. ONLY IN AMERICA HAVE WE SEEN TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME, THE TRUTH OF THE WORDS THAT ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE REASON THAT'S TRUE IS BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S EVER MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. ONE PERSON, REACHING OUT TO ANOTHER TO CHANGE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE AND TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. I DON'T SEEK THE PRESIDENCY FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT I AM READY TO WORK WITH YOU TO RESTORE AMERICA TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE WORLD AND TO RESTORE THE AMERICAN DREAM TO EACH ONE OF OUR CHILDREN WHETHER THEY LIVE IN LIVINGSTON OR NEWARK OR CAMDEN, PATTERSON, OR JERSEY CITY, NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE OF THOSE CHILDREN BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO NOT ONLY SPEAKS TO THEM, BUT WHO HEARS THEM. WHO HEARS THEM AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THEIR VOICES ARE WHAT MAKES ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT GREAT. IF YOU GIVE ME THE PRIVILEGE TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL WAKE UP EVERY DAY, NOT ONLY WITH MY HEART STRONG AND MY MIND SHARP, BUT WITH MY EARS OPEN AND MY ARMS OPEN, TO WELCOME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT PARTY, RACE, CREED, COLOR, TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR COUNTRY, AS WELL. WE WILL WIN THIS COUNTRY AND I LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) >>",2015-11-07 17:48:39,2015-06-30,Livingston,New Jersey

HELD IN CHICAGO THIS IS 45 MINUTES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US HERE TODAY AND BEING A PART OF THIS. I WANT TO BEGIN RIGHT POINTING OUT THE FACT THAT IT'S BEEN 15 AND A HALF YEARS SINCE THE 21ST CENTURY AND IT WAS A CENTURY WHERE IN WHICH OUR NATION OVERCAME AND LEAD THE WORLD AGAINST EVIL MULTIPLE TIMES AND RECORDED SOME OF THE GREATEST ADVANCES IN HUMAN HISTORY. AIRPLANES IN THE SKY, BOOT PRINTS ON THE MOON, THE SCOT DAVID CODE KNOWLEDGE BROUGHT ON BECAUSE WE BUILD BUILT WAS NO CIVILIZATION HAS EVER BUILT BEFORE. A VIBRANT, STABLE, BROAD AND ACCESSIBLE MIDDLE-CLASS WHICH OUR PEOPLE DROVE THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD. MY PARENTS WERE TWO IMMIGRANTS WITH LITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION. THEY DID SO THROUGH HUMBLE JOBS. FIRST AS AN ASSEMBLY PLANT AND THEN MY MOTHER WENT TO WORK AS A CASHIER AND FINALLY STOCK CLERK AT KMART. MY FATHER WAS A BARTENDER FOR HOTEL BANQUET. THEY NEVER GOT RICH. BUT MY PARENTS ACHIEVED THE AMERICAN DREAM BECAUSE THROUGH THESE JOBS BE REACHED FINANCIAL SECURITY AT THE FAMILY IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD. MORE PEOPLE ACHIEVE THIS AMERICAN DREAM IN THE 21ST CENTURY THAN ANY OTHER TIME AND ANY OTHER PLACE IN HUMAN HISTORY MANY JOBS LIKE THE ONES MY PARENTS HELD NO LONGER PROVIDE A VIABLE PATH TO THE MIDDLE-CLASS. THEIR JOBS ASSEMBLING LAWN CHAIRS OR A CASHIER JOB MY MOTHER HELD HAVE LIKELY BEEN REPLACED BY MISSION. OTHER SIMILAR POSITIONS HAVE BEEN OUTSOURCED OR HAVE PAID THE SAME WAGE FOR A DECADE OR MORE. MOST OF THOSE IMPACTED THE LACK OF QUALIFICATIONS TO MOVE INTO THE BETTER POSITION INTO THE HIGHER EDUCATION THEY NEED IS TO EXPENSIVE AND REQUIRES TOO MUCH TIME AWAY FROM WORKING FAMILIES. THE RESULT IS THAT THE PATH OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS IS NOW MORE TODAY THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR GENERATIONS AND THE AMERICAN DREAM SO MANY ACHIEVED IN THE LAST CENTURY IS NOW IN PAIR WROTE. THIS HARDSHIP IS NOT THE RESULT OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WILL NATURALLY COLLECTED SALT. IT IS BORN OF A FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION TO THE VERY NATURE OF OUR ECONOMY. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE FAILURE OF OUR LEADER, OUR POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS TO TRANSFORM ACCORDINGLY. THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY FORCES BEHIND THE TRANSFORMATION. THE FIRST IS RADICAL TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, WIRELESS AND MOBILE CAPABILITIES, ROBOTICS AND ORDER AND THE SECOND IS PARTLY FROM THE FIRST AND THAT IS GLOBALIZATION. FROM WHERE YOU SAID YOU CAN SELL A PRODUCT TO SOMEONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD ALMOST AS EASILY AS TO THE PERSON ON YOUR LEFT OR RIGHT. THIS PULLED US INTO COMPETITION WITH OTHER NATIONS FOR BUSINESS, JOBS, TALENT AND INNOVATION. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES NOT A SINGLE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNTOUCHED BY THESE FORCES AND THEY A THEY TRIGGERED EIGHT CASCADE. FEWER AMERICANS BELIEVE IN THE VIABILITY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM TODAY THAN DURING THE WORST OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2009. MANY OUTLETS FELT THAT WHICH AUTOMATION AND OUTSOURCING CONTINUED TO SHATTER BUT HISTORY ISN'T SILENT ON THE SUBJECT. IT TELLS US THE FUTURE IS SPRAYED BY THE ACTIONS WE TAKE. GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS BEFORE US FACE DISRUPTIVE PERIODS OF TRANSFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE REVOLUTION THEY AUTOMATED TASKS PEOPLE HAVE BUILT THEIR LIVES AROUND FOR CENTURIES. LIKE TODAY THE BEGINNING WAS ROUGH. JOBS WERE LOST, WAGES WERE STATIC AND NEW WEALTH WAS CONCENTRATED AT THE TOP. FEARS ABOUT THE FUTURE WERE WIDESPREAD. BUT THEN SOMETHING CHANGED TO READ BY OUR CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TODAY THEY LEARNED IT WAS A PERIOD OF PROGRESS. YES, JOBS WERE LOST. BUT EVEN MORE JOBS WERE GAINED. THE MIDDLE-CLASS EXPANDED AND LAID THE CORNERSTONE OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY DID THEY OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES AGAINST NEW TECHNOLOGY TO RESURRECT THE JOB IT WAS THROUGH ADAPTATION LEARNING NEW SKILLS AND LEADERS AND LEANING IN A NEW DIRECTION. TODAY'S TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION CARRIES EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES. EVEN MORE I BELIEVE IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THAT WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN THESE OPPORTUNITIES. WHETHER WE DO OR DO NOT WILL DEPEND ON THE ACTIONS WE TAKE, THE LEADERS WE CHOOSE AND THE REFORMS THAT WE ADOPT. FOR THE FIRST 15 AND A HALF YEARS OF THE CENTURY WASHINGTON HAS LOOKED TO THE PATH. OUR ECONOMY HAS CHANGED BUT OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE NOT AND WE HAVE LEARNED PAINFULLY THE OLD WAYS NO LONGER WORKS. WASHINGTON CANNOT PRETEND THE WORLD IS THE SAME AS IT WAS IN THE 1980s. IT CANNOT RAISE TAXES LIKE IT DID IN THE '90s AND CANNOT GROW GOVERNMENT. THE RACE FOR THE FUTURE WILL NEVER BE WON BY GOING BACKWARD. IT WILL NEVER BE WON BY HOPPING ON HILLARY CLINTON'S TIME MACHINE TO YESTERDAY. SHE SEEMS TO BELIEVE AS MANY DO THE PUMPING UP MORE OF TODAY'S MONEY INTO YESTERDAY'S PROGRAMS WILL BRING PROSPERITY TOMORROW. IT WILL NOT, NOR WILL THINKING SMALL. HIKING THE WAGE BY A FEW DOLLARS WILL NOT SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM IT CRUSHED SMALL BUSINESS. WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY A NEW PRESIDENT FOR A NEW AGE ONE WITH ORIGINAL IDEAS TO UNLOCK THE GREAT DOORS TO THE FUTURE, THE DOORS OF INNOVATION IN THE VEGETATION. IN THE REVOLUTIONIZED EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN WE EAT WITH ALL OF OUR PEOPLE TO BUILD THESE BETTER PAYING JOBS. PROSPERITY IN OUR TIME IS LIKELY IF WE ACT TO INCREASE FUTURE. WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE AND THE CHANCE TO SEE THEM THAT WILL NEVER EXIST AGAIN. I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO DISCUSS MY IDEAS TO DISPLAY THAT INNOVATION ONWARD TO ENSURE THE RISE OF THE MACHINES WILL NOT BE THE FAULT OF THE WORKER AND TO CREATE A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY BY THE REVITALIZED AMERICAN DREAM AND CAPTURE BY THE VIBRANT MIDDLE CLASS. AND THEY WILL TRANSFORM THE WORLD. CARS MAY SOON DRIVE THEMSELVES. GOOD NEWS FOR ME IF YOU'VE READ SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES. >> WHO ARE THEY GOING TO GIVE THE RED LIGHT CAMERA TO ASK THE TECHNOLOGY ROBOTICS AND MORE WILL IMPACT US IN WAYS WE CANNOT GET IMAGINE. DEVICES WILL GROW POWERFULLY AND BRING CAPABILITIES TO THE MASSES. THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER INNOVATION IS COMING. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER AMERICA WILL DEVELOP AND PRODUCE TO CREATE TO BUILD THE MOST INNOVATIVE FRIENDLY ECONOMY OF THE WORLD WE MUST BUILD THE MOST BUSINESS FRIENDLY ECONOMY IN THE WORLD FREE OF RIGHT NOW WE HAVE QUITE NEARLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE. THE UNITED STATES IS THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD. WE HAVE A TAX CODE THAT PUNISHES AMERICAN COMPANIES COMPETING IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND A REGULATORY SYSTEM THAT PREVENTS SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE THE PRIMARY ENGINES OF INNOVATION AND JOB CREATION FROM COMPETING AGAINST ESTABLISHED PLAYERS. THE RESULTS OF THE APPROACH ARE IN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS, WE HAVE MORE BUSINESSES DIE IN THE BAND BEING BORN. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR OUR ECONOMY SHRANK FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OUR RECOVERY BEGAN AND OVER THE LAST DECADE, THE UNITED STATES HAS LOST $179 BILLION WORTH. I WILL EMPOWER INNOVATORS RATHER THAN PUNISH. IT'S TO THE DEVELOPED NATIONS THAT WE HAVE DONE THIS TEN YEARS AGO. WE COULD HAVE ACQUIRED $590 BILLION WORTH OF FOREIGN TRUST AND I WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH A TERRITORIAL TAX WHEN AN AMERICAN COMPANY EARNS MONEY OVERSEAS IT IS TAXED IN THAT COUNTRY AND THE COUNTRY THAT HE EARNED IT IN IF IT IS EARNED IN AMERICA. WE ARE THE ONLY G8 COUNTRY THAT WAS HE THAT SECOND TAX AND THE UNDERSTANDABLE IMPACT IS THAT MANY COMPANIES CHOOSE NEVER TO BRING THEIR MONEY BACK HOME. APPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS $171 BILLION SITTING OVERSEAS. THAT MONEY WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC BOOST THAT BECAUSE APPLE WOULD BE PUNISHED FOR BRINGING IT BACK, THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. MY TAX PLAN WOULD ALLOW 100% FOR BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS A MORE -- THE MORE A COMPANY INVESTS THE LESS THEY GO IN TEXAS AND THE MORE THEY PAY THE WORKERS THE LESS THEY PAY THE GOVERNMENT. I WILL PUT A CEILING ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. REGULATION ADVOCATE CAN COST THE ECONOMY. JUST SINCE THE YEAR 2008 FEDERAL REGULATIONS HAVE COST US $771 BILLION. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS ARE THE RESULT OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN BIG BUSINESS AND BIG GOVERNMENT. SHE'S RIGHT BUT WHAT SHE WON'T TELL YOU IS THAT THE BIG GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE RATING IN THE EVERETT IS THAT BECAUSE THE INSTRUMENT OF THOSE LAYERS AND LOBBYISTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT IT. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK TOO WORK TO EMPOWER AND PROTECT THE PRIVATE SECTOR, NOT TO CONTROL IT. I SPONSORED A PLAN WITH A SENATOR TO MODERNIZE WHICH HAS LONG BEEN A LEADING SOURCE OF RESOURCE AND SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY. MY LEGISLATION WOULD INCREASE THE FLEXIBILITY TO PARTNER WITH THE PRIMITIVE STREAK. WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE THE INDUSTRY THAT NEEDS SPECIAL PROTECTION IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IN ITS SHORT LIFE COMMITTEE INTERNET, THE INTERNET HAS BECOME ONE OF HUMANITY'S GREATEST TREASURES WHICH IS WHY HE BELONGS IN THE HANDS OF OUR PEOPLE, NOT OUR GOVERNMENT. IN THE SENATE BY FOX TO SAFEGUARD AND REINFORCE INTERNET FREEDOM IN THE DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY AND WILL CONTINUE THE FIGHT AS PRESIDENT. I LEAD A COALITION OPPOSING EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INTERNET REGULATORY POWER FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNIT AND I WILL ALSO ADVANCE THE COMPREHENSIVE WIRELESS PLANS IS INTO THE AMOUNT MADE AVAILABLE AND THE RESULT FOR AN ESTIMATED 350,000 JOBS WERE 500. FINALLY TO WIN THE GLOBAL COMPETITION FOR THE INNOVATION, WE MUST WIN THE GLOBAL COMPETITION FOR TALENT. THIS REQUIRES REFORMING THE LEGAL IMMIGRATION TO MAKE THE SKILL RATHER THAN FAMILY-BASED WHICH WILL PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS AND ALSO ATTRACT MORE TALENT TO GROW THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS. INNOVATION IS THE FIRST DOOR TO THE FUTURE BUT EVEN ONCE WE PASS THROUGH IT A SECOND DOOR REMAINED SHUT IN FRONT OF US. INNOVATION WILL CREATE MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES DID WE MUST ENSURE IT ALSO CREATES A VIBRANT MIDDLE CLASS AND THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH THE MODERNIZATION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION. AS OUR TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES GROW, IT IS TRUE THAT WE WILL SEE MORE LOW-PAYING JOBS REPLACED BY MACHINES BUT THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE STORY. WITH THE INNOVATION ECONOMY THAT I JUST DISCUSSED WITH THEM WE'VE ALSO SEE THE CREATION OF HIGHER-PAYING HIGH SCHOOL TO JOBS ONLY HUMANS CAN PERFORM AND HISTORY BACKS THIS UP. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE POWER LOOM WAS INVENTED MANY FEARED THAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE ALL TEXTILE JOBS. THE TRUTH TURNED OUT TO BE THE OPPOSITE. IT INCREASED PRODUCTION AND AS THE PRODUCTION INCREASED, SO DID THE DEMAND AND AS THE DEMAND INCREASED SO DID THE NEED FOR SKILLED LABOR THAT COULD OPERATE THE MACHINE AND MANAGE. JOBS IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY INCREASED FOR 100 YEARS AFTER. BUT THESE DROPS TO NOT IMMEDIATELY. BEFORE THAT COULD HAPPEN, WORKERS NEEDED TO LEARN MARKETABLE SKILLS THAT COULD BE STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. ONLY THEN COULD THE METHODS LEARNED IN ONE FACTORY BECOME USEFUL IN ANOTHER TO INCREASE AND GIVE THEM LEVERAGE TO DEMAND A HIGHER WAGES. THE LESSON OF HISTORY THAT IS CLEAR TO EMPOWER TODAY'S WORKER WE MUST EQUIP THEM WITH TODAY'S AND TO DO THAT WE NEED A HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM TO INNOVATE AT THE SAME RATE AS OUR ECONOMY. IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS, 3.5 MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS WILL BE CREATED IF THE HIGHER EDUCATION BUT IF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM REMAINS STAGNANT AND STUCK IN THE PAST, 2 MILLION OF THE JOBS WILL BE LEFT. THE SAME SKILLS GAP IN THE INDUSTRY NEARLY ONE OUT OF EVERY AMERICAN RECORDS HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING SKILLS THAT WE STILL TELL OUR STUDENTS THAT TO GET A DEGREE THEY HAVE TO SPEND FOUR YEARS ON THE CAMPUS CONTENT OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON TUITION AND BOOKS AND ROOM AND BOARD AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN THE CLASSROOM OFTEN LEARNING SUBJECTS THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT AND THE RESULT IS TODAY MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GRADUATING WITH A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT OR A DEGREE THAT WILL NOT LEAD TO JOBS AND MANY WHO NEED HIGHER EDUCATION THE MOST SUCH AS SINGLE PARENTS PARENTS AND WORKING ADULTS ARE LEFT WITH OPTIONS THAT FIT THEIR SCHEDULES IN THEIR BUDGET. THE PROBLEM WITH WITH YOUR EDUCATION A UNIFICATION AS MANY BUT THE IDEA FROM FOR THE CLINTON AND OTHER OUTDATED LEADERS ARE NARROW AND SHORTSIGHTED. WE DO NOT NEED THAT WEEKS TO THE OLD SYSTEM WE NEED A HOLISTIC OVERALL ON HOW MUCH THE ACCESS COSTS AND HOW THE COSTS ARE PAID AND EVEN HOW THE PAYMENTS ARE DETERMINED. AS PRESIDENT I WILL BEGIN WITH A COVER FOR THE SIMPLE COMMERCIAL SIMPLE REFORM. OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM TODAY IS CONTROLLED BY WHAT AMOUNTS TO A CARTEL IN THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT USE THEIR POWER OVER THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS TO BLOCK THE INNOVATIVE LOW-COST COMPETITORS FROM ENTERING THE MARKETPLACE. WITHIN MY FIRST 100 DAYS WE WILL DO THIS BY ESTABLISHING THE NEW ACCREDITATION PROCESS THAT WELCOMES LOW-COST INNOVATIVE PROVIDERS. THIS WOULD EXPOSE HIGHER EDUCATION TO MARKET FORCES TWICE AND COMPOSITION OF WHAT PROMPTED THE REVOLUTION DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS. JUST AS THE NEEDS OF CONSUMERS DRIVE THE PROCESS OF OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE ECONOMY. OTHER REFORMS CAN HASTEN THE TRANSITION. I WOKE EMPOWER THEM TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT DEGREE AT THE RIGHT PRICE FROM THE RIGHT INSTITUTION FOR THEM. I PROPOSED AN IDEA CALLED THE STUDENT RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO ACT WHICH REQUIRES AN INSTITUTION TO TELL SHOW STUDENTS HOW MUCH THEY CAN EXPECT TO EARN WITH A GIVEN DEGREE BEFORE THEY TAKE OUT THE LOAN TO PAY FOR IT. I WILL MAKE THEM MORE MANAGEABLE BY MAKING INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT AUTOMATIC FOR ALL GRADUATES SO THE MORE THEY MAKE THE FASTER THEY PAY BACK THEIR LOANS AND THE LESS THEY MAKE THE LIST OF LOANS WILL COST. I WILL REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ONE'S AND EASE THE SHADOW OF DEATH BUT FOR FUTURE STUDENTS WE CAN ALSO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT AVOIDS THE PROBLEM OF DEBT ALTOGETHER. AN IDEA IN THE STUDENT INVESTMENT PLAN WOULD BUT WITH STUDENTS PARTNERED WITH INVESTORS WHO WOULD PAY THEIR TUITION AND RETURN FOR A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR EARNINGS FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER GRADUATION MAY RESULT IN A PROCESS FOR THE INVESTMENT OWNERSHIP NOT BUT UNLIKE WITH LOANS, NONE OF THE RISK LIES WITH THE STUDENTS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ALSO MAKE CAREER AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION MORE WIDESPREAD AND ACCESSIBLE. THIS CAN BEGIN AS EARLY AS HIGH SCHOOL SO WE CAN GRADUATE STUDENTS AUGUST WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA BUT ALSO WITH A CERTIFICATION TO WORK AS A MECHANIC, PLUMBER, BOULDER OR ELECTRICIAN. BY ALLOWING THE STUDENTS TO EARN METHODS FROM EXPERIENCED WORKERS HAD BEEN SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF IDEAS BUT I'VE SEEN HAVE SEEN HOW THEY BEGIN TO OPEN UP DOORS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. IN MIAMI ICING HIGH SCHOOLS GRADUATE OF A CERTIFIED TO BEGIN HIGH-PAYING CAREERS AS BMW TECHNICIANS. I'VE KNOWN SINGLE MOTHERS WHOSE HARD-EARNED DEGREES TRANSLATED INTO THIS LONG FOR FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN AND I'VE SEEN HIGHER EDUCATION SHAPE MY OWN LIFE IN TERMS OF THE COST WE MUST REMEDY AND THE ENORMOUS PAYOFF WE MUST EXTEND TO ALL. MY INNOVATION HIGHER EDUCATION AGENDA FOR MY SEGMENT BUT IT'S BASED ON A SIMPLE CONCEPT TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES CANNOT BE SEIZED BY OLD IDEAS INTO THE FUTURE MUST BE EMBRACED WITH ENTHUSIASM AND IN THE 19TH CENTURY THE GENERATION DID EXACTLY THAT. THEY FACE CHALLENGES SIMILAR TO OURS. THE STEAM ENGINE MADE IT SMALLER. THE TIGRIS OPENED THE NEW AGE OF COMMUNICATION. NEW MACHINES CREATED NEW INDUSTRIES AND UPENDED A CENTURY-OLD ECONOMIC STATUS QUO. JUST IMAGINE WHAT THE WORLD WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE IF THAT GENERATION HAD RESISTED THESE CHANGES RATHER THAN EMBRACE THEM. IMAGINE IF THEY REFUSE TO GIVE UP THE OLD WAY AND ALLOW THE PROMISE OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE TO PASS BY. THE LOSS WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFERED NOT ONLY BY THEIR GENERATION BUT OTHERS AFTER. THE STAKES FOR OUR TIME ARE JUST AS HIGH IF WE FAIL TO CAPTURE THE NEW AGE IT WOULD BE A WEAKER AMERICA BEHIND BUT IF WE SUCCEED WE WILL LAY THE CORNERSTONE FOR THE NEW AMERICAN COUNTRY. WE WILL NOT JUST RECOVER ECONOMIC AROUND WHAT WE WILL GROUNDER BUT WE WILL GAIN IT AND SEE THE CREATION OF HIGHER PAYING MORE EXCITING JOBS THAN EVER BEFORE. THERE ARE THOSE TODAY AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WHOSE A PROSPERITY IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE FUTURE IS LOST. IT SEEMS FOR A WHILE YOU HAVE TO DO TO BECOME A BEST SELLING AUTHOR IS RATED WITH PREDICTING A POST-AMERICAN WORLD ONE DRIVEN BY CHINA OR EUROPE OR SOME OTHER POWER. MANY OF THESE FORECASTS COME FROM PEOPLE THAT RARELY LEAVES OCEANS IN DC. IF THE CITY IS WILL THEY SEE IT'S NO WONDER THEY THINK AMERICA IS IN TROUBLE SO I SAY TO THEM GO TO BOSTON, BOX WITH THE MOST INNOVATIVE SQUARE IN THE WORLD AND FAIR THEY CAN SEE THROUGH THE WORKING LOOKING GLASS. GO TO THE FLORIDA SPACE COAST SEE HOW PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS HAVE PUT NEW ADVENTURES AND ACHIEVEMENTS INTO DISCOVERIES IN REACH OF HUMANKIND AND HOW AN AMERICAN FLAG ON MARS TURNED TO AND ACHIEVABLE AMERICAN DREAM. GO TO RENO NEVADA CAN SEE THE 1.2 SQUARE-FOOT DISTRIBUTION HOUSE OPENED BY AMAZON AND THE 5 BILLION-DOLLAR FACTORY BEING CONSTRUCTED THAT WILL TRANSFORM AND CREATE AS MANY AS 9,000 GOOD PAYING JOBS IN NEVADA ALONE. GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE TO VISIT SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS NAMED ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD ON THE LIST WITH APPLE AND GOOGLE FOR HELP PUSHES AGAINST THE ODDS TO BRING HIGHER EDUCATION TO THE 21ST CENTURY AND I ALSO SAY TO THEM COME TO CHICAGO THE 50,000 SQUARE FOOT FACILITY THAT SERVES FOR DIGITAL INNOVATION IN THE MIDWEST PROVIDING THE TOWNSHIP IN THE AND THE RISK OF IMAGE WORSHIP, TRAINING, PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE, POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN THE COMMUNITY DEDICATED TO PULLING THE BUSINESSES INTO THE NEW AGE. THESE EXAMPLES ARE NOT OUTLIERS, THEY ARE A PATTERN AND ANYONE THAT SEES THESE THINGS WILL UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED. WE ARE THE INHERITORS OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT AND AMERICAN DREAM. IN OUR GAMES SO THE BLOOD OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE LORD OF BURDEN OF THE PAST WERE REFINED WAY OF DOING THINGS. AS WE PAY RESPECT TO THE AMERICANS OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION SOLO CAN BE WRITTEN BY THOSE THAT HAVE NOT YET. LET THEM WRITE THAT WE DID OUR PART AND IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE CENTURY WE ELECTED LEADERS FOR THE TIME AND ADOPTED THE POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE AMERICANS TO INVENT A PRODUCT OF TOMORROW, MANUFACTURE THEM AND SELL THEM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND WE DESIGNED THE HIGHER EDUCATION THAT ALLOWED THE MIDDLE CLASS TO PERFORM THE GREAT WORK AND REAP GREAT REWARDS OF THE CENTURY. TIM HAS BROUGHT US TO THE FUTURE BUT WHETHER WE TURN WAS THE COST THRESHOLD IN OF THE NEW AGE AND WHETHER WE GRACED THIS ENTRY WITH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES ITS ADVENTURES AND DANGERS ARE THAT DECISION IS OURS ALONE. WE HAVE LINGERED LONG ENOUGH AND I INVITE YOU TO STEP FORWARD WITH ME. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> BEFORE WE GET STARTED I KNOW YOU LOVE THE MIAMI DOLPHINS BUT I WANT TO REMIND YOU YOU WERE IN THE HOME OF THE NHL -- >> THERE ARE NOT A LOT IN THE NHL. THEY DON'T PLAY HOCKEY IN CUBA. THE >> WELCOME TO CHICAGO AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR HOSTING THIS EVENT. LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY MORE BROADLY. UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN, AND YET -- WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? >> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE TRADITIONAL MARKERS OF ECONOMIC HEALTH DON'T MEAN WHAT THEY ONCE DID. SO, FOR EXAMPLE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ARE UNDEREMPLOYED AND THEY ARE EARNING WAGES THAT HAVEN'T KEPT UP. A GRAPHIC EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WITHIN 31 STATES IN THE COUNTRY, CHILD CARE IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN GOING TO COLLEGE. SO IMAGINE IF YOU ARE A SINGLE MOTHER THINKS $900 WEEK YOU ARE EMPLOYED AT 300 OR 250 GOING TO CHILD CARE THAT IS A HUGE CHUNK OF YOUR BUDGET AND HE THAT IS INDIE THAT IS AN EXAMPLE -- MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OUT OF SEARCHING FOR WORK. THEY'VE GIVEN UP AND BECOME THE MORALIZED. THEY ARE WORKING PART-TIME FOR DIFFERENT JOBS COMING INTO THAT OF COURSE THE NATURE OF THE ECONOMY SUCH THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT WORK IF ONE COMPANY FOR 25 EUROS. YOU ARE DOING JOBS AS OPPOSED TO WORKING IN THE FIRM DEPENDING ON THESE FACTORS INTO THE RESULT OF ALL OF THIS IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE NO LONGER MEANS WHAT IT ONCE DID YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE WORKING FORCE IS AS SLOW AS IT HAS BEEN OVER 40 YEARS AND THEN YOU ADD TO THAT THE WAGES THAT HAVE BEEN STAGNANT WHILE THE COST OF LIVING HAS INCREASED AND THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE EVER GOING TO CLOSE THAT GAP IS TO CREATE BETTER PAYING JOBS AND THEN HELP PEOPLE ACQUIRE THE SKILLS THEY NEED A. >> LET PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY. THE TOP 1% IS GETTING RICH WHILE THE MAIN STREET IS BEING LEFT BEHIND. >> IT IS A SYMPTOM OF A BROAD PROBLEM WHICH IS THE OPPORTUNITY THE PRIMARY ONE IS THE HIGH-PAYING JOB IN IN IN THE 21ST CENTURY THE CAREERS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY FULFILLING IN THE 21ST CENTURY JUST SAY A LOT MORE MONEY THAN THE SIMILAR CAREERS IN THE 20s BUT IF YOU ARE NOT IN ONE OF THOSE FIELDS OR ONE OF THOSE INDUSTRIES THAN YOU ARE STAGNANT AND FOR THE RESULTS OF THAT GAP. FIRST YOU HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO CREATE JOBS AND GIVE PEOPLE THE SKILLS THEY NEED THEY GREW UP DURING THE TIME WHEN THEY MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD HOMEOWNERSHIP TO RAISE A FAMILY AND RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. JOBS LIKE THAT SIMPLY DON'T PAY ENOUGH ANYMORE FOR THOSE COST MORE. IN ORDER FOR MY PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO SEE TODAY THAT THEY DID 25 YEARS AGO BY DAD WOULD HAVE HAD TO BECOME AN ELECTRICIAN. MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE HAD TO BECOME A DENTAL HYGIENIST APPARENTLY THE. AND THAT REQUIRES HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE NO ACCESS TO BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO WORK FULL-TIME AND RAISING FAMILY. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO CREATE THOSE BETTER PAYING JOBS AND THEN MAKE IT THE EASIEST PLACE TO ACQUIRE THE SKILLS FOR THOSE BETTER PAYING JOBS AND YOU HAVE TO DO BOTH. >> HOW MUCH OF AN ECONOMIC DRAG IS THE NATIONAL DEBT? >> IT'S BEING DEDICATED INTO THE LESSONS AVAILABLE TO INVEST IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT BEYOND THAT IT CREATES THE SPECTER OF THE DEBT CRISIS AND THE DEBT CRISIS ISN'T A GOOD THING FOR THE COUNTRY THAT IS TRYING TO INSPIRE IN THE FUTURE. AND NOTHING CHANGES. WE CONTINUE DOING THE THINGS WE ARE NOW AT SOME POINT WE WILL HAVE A DEBT CRISIS. THERE IS ALTHOUGH RESERVE CURRENCY AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES ARE UNSTABLE. EVENTUALLY, INVESTORS, PEOPLE THAT THAT LOVE AND MONEY BY LOAN THE MONEY BY BUYING THE DEBT WILL INSIST ON A HIGHER YIELD AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER RETURN. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, THE INTEREST PAYMENTS ALONE WILL TRIGGER THE DEBT CRISIS AND THE RESULTS WILL BE CATASTROPHIC FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THE NATIONAL DEBT IS THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF DYNAMIC ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE THINGS THAT I OUTLINED HERE TODAY AND BY REFORMING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. AND I WANT TO REFORM THE PROGRAM WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES. MY OTHER IS ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. I WANT THOSE PROGRAMS TO SAY EXACTLY THE WAY THEY ARE FOR HER AND PEOPLE OF SIMILAR A SIMILAR AGE THEY'RE ALREADY RETIRED OR WERE ABOUT TO RETIRE. THAT WILL REQUIRE MY GENERATION AND PEOPLE YOUNGER THAN ME TO ACCEPT THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. IT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD BUT IT'S GOING TO WORK DIFFERENTLY. WE HAVE TO RETIRE A YEAR LATER THAN OUR PARENTS DID. OUR BENEFITS MAY NOT GO AS FAST AS WE SEE WITH SECURITY AS OUR PARENTS DID. OUR MEDICARE PLAN MAY INVOLVE CHOICES. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO BRING CONTROL TO THE BALANCE LONG-TERM. THE NATIONAL DEBT ISN'T BEING DRIVEN. IT'S NOT BEING DRIVEN BY THE DEFENSE SPENDING. IT'S NOT BEING DRIVEN BY FOOD STAMPS AND WELFARE. ALL THE PROGRAMS I MENTIONED ARE IN NEED OF REFORMS THE DRIVER OF THE DEBT ARE THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN THEY ARE TAKING IN AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AT AN INCREASING RATE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. [INAUDIBLE] MOST REPUBLICANS IN THE FIELD SAY -- >> IT NEEDS TO BE CONFRONTED. BUT IT'S LARGELY DONE INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INSURED AND THE GOVERNMENT MANDATED PLAN THE PLANS TO BE AFFORDABLE HAVE HAD TO DO TWO THINGS. THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE PAYMENTS VERY HIGH SO YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS GOING TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM OR DOCTOR AND GETTING A BILL AND THE BILL WILL BE TWO OR $3,000 DEPENDING AND THEY SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY. SO, AS A RESULT OF THE PROVIDERS ARE NOT GETTING PAID SO SUDDENLY THE PLANS ARE NOT ONLY EXPENSIVE IN TERMS OF THE BILLS YOU ARE TAKING ON BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS TO GIVE YOU THE TRACES YOU NEED. WHY? IF THEY CAN'T COLLECT THE DETECTABLE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET PAID THE FULL AMOUNT SO MORE PROVIDERS DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE SO NOW YOU HAVE AN ENTRANCE INTO THE PREMIUM IS SUBSIDIZED AND YOU HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER TO CHOOSE FROM. THE BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO SAY THE 21ST CENTURY EVERY AMERICAN WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR OWN HEALTH-INSURANCE DECISION. EVERY AMERICAN WHETHER IT IS A TAX CREDIT OR YOUR EMPLOYER'S MONEY WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE FOR VETERANS FROM ANY COMPANY IN ANY STATE IN AMERICA AND WILL BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PURCHASE THE KIND OF INSURANCE THAT YOU WANT. THAT MAY BE A HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES IN THE CATASTROPHIC HOSPITALIZATION. OTHERS MAY REQUIRE MORE COMPREHENSIVE CARE. MY POINT IS NOW UN POWER PRIVATE SECTOR TO COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS ON THE BASIS. I KNOW IT ISN'T A PERFECT ANALOGY BUT YOU CAN'T TURN ON THE TV WITHOUT GETTING FIVE OR SIX COMMERCIALS. YOUR EMPLOYER AND THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TELL YOU. THEY WILL TARGET AND MARKETED TO DO ON THE BASIS. THAT IS A BETTER APPROACH THAN WE HAVE NOW. >> YOU MENTIONED IMMIGRATION REFORM AS A PART OF THE IMMIGRATION PIECE OF THE PLAN. PART OF IT WAS TO PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS. DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT AND THAT IMMIGRATION PUTS DOWN ON THE WAGES? >> WOULD PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS IF YOU GO TO THE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION YOU AND I ARE BRINGING PEOPLE IN ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE ECONOMICALLY. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT CREATES JOBS FOR AMERICA BECAUSE IT MAKES COMPANIES MORE PRODUCTIVE AND ALLOWS THEM TO OPEN MORE LINES OF BUSINESSES AND THAT CREATES JOBS FOR PEOPLE ALREADY LIVING HERE. THAT'S WHY IT'S WHAT WE NEED IN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE ARE ENGAGED IN A GLOBAL COMPETITION NOT JUST FOR INVESTMENT ORGANIZATION, WE ARE ENGAGED IN A COMPETITION INTO THE HIGHER SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO ATTRACT THE BEST IN THE WORLD AS OPPOSED THAT IT'S VIRTUALLY BUILT ON WHETHER OR NOT. >> WAS ASKED ABOUT CYBERSECURITY. WE'VE READ ABOUT THE PERSONAL MANAGEMENT PACK AND FILES STORED IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BECOME INFUSED WITH PRACTICE. WE HAVE MULTIPLE AGENCIES EACH WITH THEIR OWN CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND SOMETIMES THE GENERATIONS OUT OF STEP IN THE LATEST PRACTICES AND SO I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BECOME INFUSED INTO BEST PRACTICES AND TO ADD SOME UNITARY STANDARDS ALL AGENCIES TO COMPLY WITH. >> IT IS TO SHARE WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT BEING CLOSE TO LAWSUITS OR GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE OR THINGS OF THIS NATURE BECAUSE THIS IS AN ONGOING THREAT. THE BALDING QUICKLY. YOU COME UP WITH A SOLUTION IN THE POTENTIAL THREATS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED THAT YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE COLLABORATION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE GOVERNMENT'S TECHNOLOGY SECTOR AND PRIVATE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR. THEY ARE ALL INTERWOVEN. THE GOVERNMENT BREACH WOULD LEAD VICE VERSA. IT'S IMPORTANT TO PASS THE LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS THERE TO BE MORE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT. >> WHO IS THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OR? >> I'M ABOUT OVERTAKING OUR BIGGEST THREAT IS AMERICA. WE ARE THE BIGGEST THREAT TO OURSELVES AND THE GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE 21ST CENTURY IS THAT IT'S NOT A ZERO-SUM GAME. IT DOESN'T MEAN SOMEONE ELSE HAS TO BE WORSE OFF. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. ESPECIALLY IN THE GLOBALIZED ECONOMY FOR PROSPERITY CAN ALSO LEAD TO PROSPERITY SOMEWHERE ELSE AND VICE VERSA. WE NEED TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF THE WIN AND YOU LOSE WHETHER IT IS IN OUR OWN DOMESTIC ECONOMY OR THE WORLD AT LARGE. THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING THINGS. TECHNOLOGY HAS FLATTENED THE INFORMATION. SO IT COULD BE SHARED WITHIN SECONDS WITH SOMEONE HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD. KNOWLEDGE IS A SHARED COMMODITY CONTROLLED BY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE BUT THE BENEFIT IS AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE. THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS THAT WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE US ON THAT POWER. I BELIEVE THAT CHINA HAS THAT AMBITION. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE NECESSARILY SHARE THAT VIEW IN TERMS OF AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP AND I DO THINK THAT IN ANY RESPECTS, HOW AMERICA AND CHINA INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER WILL BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST GEOPOLITICAL SOURCE. IT WAS DETERMINED WITH WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN THE WORLD. I THINK RUSSIA HAS A SIGNIFICANT DOMESTIC PROBLEM. THEIR GDP IS ONLY $2 TRILLION. IT'S NOT AN ECONOMIC POWER BUT IT IS A MILITARY POWER AND BUY IT AND THAT IS DETERMINED AS A GREAT LEADER AND A GREAT COUNTRY FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD IS ULTIMATELY WE WANTED TO BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND PLANET THAT CAN AFFORD TO BUY THINGS WE DO AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE. >> I ALSO REALIZE WHEN YOU MENTIONED IN A SPEECH THAT YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO GROW THE GOVERNMENT LIKE WE DID. >> CONGRESS HAD A BIG ROLE TO PLAY ON THAT AS WELL. WITH THE FOUNDERS EVEN PEOPLE IN MY OWN PARTY RUN ON THE PROMISE OF LIMITING THE SIZE OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE NEGRO IS THEMSELVES. IF YOU LOOK BACK AT PERIOD OF TIME WE HAVE THE TAX REDUCTIONS IN AMERICA AND HISTORIC GROWTH IN REVENUE THAT WOULD OVERSHADOW THE HISTORICAL INCREASES. SO IT'S IMPORTANT. WE WILL LEARN THAT AS A NATION. >> IT'S INTERESTING THERE IS A POPULIST STRAIN ON THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT WITH WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE BERNIE BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH WARREN AND OCCUPY WALL STREET FOLKS LOOK AT IT AS CRONY CAPITALISM AND BIG BUSINESS TO RIG THE GAME AGAINST MAINE STREET THE AVERAGE GUY. HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS AND IT AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT IT? >> IT GOES BACK TO THE POINT THAT THE MORE PEOPLE CAN INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE. SO I TELL A STORY IN MY BOOK THAT I TEACH A COURSE AT FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY. MY STUDENTS WERE COMPLAINING THAT THEY TRAVELED SOMEWHERE AND HOW TO USE THIS NEW SYSTEM. NOBODY HAD HEARD IT BEFORE. AND THEY WERE UPSET THEY COULDN'T GET IT IN MIAMI AND THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY. HERE'S WHY. THE REASON WHY YOU CAN'T USE IT IN MIAMI IS BECAUSE OF THE ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY. THEY RAISE A LOT OF MONEY AND HAVE INFLUENCE AND THEY HAVEN'T CONVINCED THEM NOT TO ALLOW ANYONE ELSE TO OFFER THE SERVICE THAT THEY OFFER USING THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT IN THAT SPACE. AND I'D MADE THAT CONNECTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN IN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND AMERICAN POLITICS. YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE RULES AND REGULATIONS ONLY THEY CAN COME PLAY WITH KNOWING THAT IT WILL CROWD OUT THOSE THAT WOULD TRY TO ENTER THAT SPACE AND THE RESULT IS FOR EVERYONE TO SEE. AFTER DODD FRANK COMMITTEE CONSOLIDATED TO THE POINT THEY WERE BIGGER THAN EVER AND WHILE 40% OF THE BANKS HAVE EVAPORATED EITHER BROUGHT OUT WERE CLOSED. IMAGINE IF BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT SOME PEOPLE IN THE ROOM DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PASS A LAW THAT SAYS THAT IN ORDER TO RENT A MOVIE YOU MUST RENT IT AT HIM IN PERSON RETAIL FACILITY YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR ID AND THE ARGUMENT WOULD BE THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT IS MAKING SURE THEY COME TO SHOW THE ID WHEN THEY RENT THE MOVIE. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ARGUMENT >> THEY ARE KICKING THEMSELVES FOR NOT THINKING OF IT BUT THAT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU SEE QUITE OFTEN WHERE ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES USE THEIR CONNECTION TO THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE THE PARAMETERS THAT ONLY THEY CAN COMPLY WITH MEANING THEY LIMITED THE AMOUNT. >> LAST QUESTION YOU ARE HEADED TO IOWA TO DO RETAILS. WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM THE VOTERS ON THE TRAIL WITH REGARDS TO THE ECONOMY OR ANYTHING ELSE? >> I WOULD DESCRIBE THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY AS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT TODAY INTO THE FUTURE AND THERE'S TWO REASONS WHY THIS HAPPENED. ON THE GEOPOLITICAL LEVEL BRINGS NEWS OF SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THE WORLD THAT MAKES IT SEEM MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER. THERE IS A TERRORIST ATTACK SOMEWHERE. RUSSIA, CHINA BUILDING ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND THEN AT HOME THEY KNOW SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. ALL THE THINGS WE ONCE TOLD PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO DO DON'T WORK AS WELL AS THEY ONCE DID BUT NO ONE HAS EXPLAINED THE NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS OR WHY IT'S NO LONGER WORKS AND WHAT IT SHOULD BE AND THAT IS WHAT IS EMBEDDED IN ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE GET. GO TO COLLEGE, GET A DEGREE. NOW THEY ARE WORKING SOMEWHERE THEY COULD HAVE WORKED WITHOUT THE $50,000. TO START A FAMILY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER YOU HAVE PEOPLE WORKING AT THE SAME JOB THEY HAD TEN YEARS AGO BUT TEN YEARS AGO THEY SAVE MONEY. NOW THEY LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK INTO THE REFRIGERATOR BREAKS DOWN THERE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. THAT IS THE SORT OF ANXIETY PEOPLE ARE CONFRONTING AND THE LEADERSHIP HASN'T TAKEN THE TIME TO EXPLAIN WHY IT HAPPENED AND THE NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. >> WE COULD HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION. THIS RACE IS REMARKABLE AND WIDE-OPEN. 14, 15, 16 CANDIDATES AND A BIG DEBATE COMING UP SOON. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE IN THIS MOMENT OF THE SORT. >> I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO. BUT I THINK PART OF IT IS THE SYMPTOM OF THE NEW ECONOMY IN THE NEW AGE. NOT LONG AGO YOU HAD TO HAVE A BIG ORGANIZATION ACCESSED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UP FRONT JUST TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT. NOW THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN IN THE HOPES SO THAT IS A FACTOR. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHAT WE ARE FACING TODAY ISN'T A CYCLICAL DOWNTURN. IT'S NOT JUST THE NORMAL UP AND DOWN OF ECONOMIC LIFE. WE WOULD EMBRACE IT OR WE WOULD BE LEFT BEHIND BY THE FUTURE. ULTIMATELY IN THE HOPES OF SERVING AS PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] [INAUDIBLE",2015-11-07 17:49:02,2015-07-07,Chicago,Illinois

[APPLAUSE] >> AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE SO THAT I CAN PRESENT MY HUSBAND, SCOTT WALKER, TO THIS GREAT COUNTRY. LAST TIME WE WERE HERE WE WERE AT THE EXPO CENTER. WE HAD JUST WON THE RECALL ELECTION. I AM SO PROUD OF SCOTT FOR WINNING THREE ELECTIONS IN FOUR YEARS. SO WHEN HE TOLD ME HE WAS THINKING ABOUT A FOURTH ELECTION I SAID WHY NOT. [APPLAUSE] >> SCOTT AND I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE TODAY WITH ALL THE SUPPORT WE HAVE FROM THIS ROOM. YOU HAVE NOT INSTANTLY BY STANDARDS. YOU MADE THE PHONE CALLS. YOU KNOCKED ON THE DOORS AND MOISST IMPORTANTLY HE PRAYED FOR US. WE CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH. [APPLAUSE] >> MOST OF YOU HERE ALREADY KNOW SCOTT AND HAVE FORMED AN IMPRESSION. MANY MORE PEOPLE WILL FORM THEIR IMPRESSIONS IN THE DAYS AND MONTHS TO COME. MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE MAN I FELL IN LOVE WITH AND MARRIED WAS SCOTT WALKER IS A GUY WHO GOES AFTER WHAT HE WANTS. [LAUGHTER] >> SCOTT AND I MET AT THE SAME KARAOKE UNITE 23 YEARS AGO. WE DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER. WE DID NOT TALK TO EACH OTHER THAT NIGHT. ON HIS WAY OUT HE SLIPPED THE ENOUGH CAN AND HE WROTE A LITTLE NOTE ON IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS GARBAGE AT FIRST THAT I GOT A DO NOT THROW IT AWAY -- THANK GOD I DID NOT THE ROADWAY. HE SAID HE HAD TO GET UP TOMORROW EARLY FOR WORK AND HE LEFT HIS NAME AND NUMBER AND HE ASKED ME OUT TO DINNER. TYPICAL SCOTT. POLITE INTO THE POINT. [LAUGHTER] >> WE TOOK ABOUT THE FACT THEY CALLED HIM A WEEK LATER. HE LIKES TO CSSAY I CALLED HIM TWO DAYS LATER. HE TOLD ME REMAIN ON THE SECOND DATE HE WOULD MARRY ME. WE HAD A REALLY GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT. [LAUGHTER] >> BY AUGUST HE PROPOSED TO ME BY HENAN BE ANOTHER NAPKIN. THIS TIME IT SAID FORGIVE ME FOR BEING RUDE, BUT WOULD YOU MARRY ME? EVEN ON HER WEDDING NIGHT AFTER OUR RECEPTION, WE STOPPED AT THE RESTAURANT AND HE WROTE ME A NOTE. ""THANK PLACE -- IT IS THIS PLACE IS A LOT OF NAPKINS."" HE IS SO SWEET AND IS NEVER FORGOTTEN OUR ANNIVERSARY, FEBRUARY 6. WHICH HAPPENS TO BE RONALD REAGAN'S BIRTHDAY. I AM SURE THAT EVEN IF IT WAS NOT REAGAN'S BIRTHDAY, HE WOULD REMOVE OR OUR ANNIVERSARY -- FOR MEMBER OUR ANNIVERSARY. WE HAVE TWO SONS AND YOU HEARD FROM THEM TODAY. [APPLAUSE] >> FROM THE MOMENT SCOTT BECAME A DAD, HE PUT OUR SONS FIRST. HE TAUGHT THEM THE VALUES OF FAITH, HARD WORK, AND HONESTY. THEY MEAN THE WORLD TO US AND OUR FAMILY IS EXCITED TO START THIS NEW ADVENTURE. OVER THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS, THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN HAVE FORMED THEIR IMPRESSIONS OF SCOTT. WITH THREE ELECTIONS IN FOUR YEARS, THEY HAVE A SECOND AND THIRD IMPRESSION, TOO. ULTIMATELY OUR FELLOW WISCONSINITES VOTED FOR HIM TO CONTINUE LEADING OUR GREAT STATE. [APPLAUSE] >> REELECT -- THREE ELECTIONS IN FOUR YEARS COULD TAKE A TOLL ON ANY FAMILY. WHILE THE HAVE BEEN TOUGH TIMES, WHEN YOU HAVE A STRONG, SUPPORTIVE, FAITH-BASED HUSBAND AND FATHER LIKE WE DO, IT MAKES THE JOURNEY A LITTLE EASIER. [APPLAUSE] >> IT WAS A DIFFICULT TIME BUT NO MATTER HOW PERSONAL THE ATTACKS BECAME, I AM SO PROUD OF THE WAY SCOTT HANDLED IT. HE NEVER MADE IT PERSONAL. INSTEAD HE WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO REFORM A BROKEN SYSTEM AND TOGETHER THEY WON. SCOTT AND I TAUGHT OUR SONS THAT IN ANY SITUATION WHEN YOU WERE UNDER FIRE, IF YOU ARE RESPECTFUL AND STAY STRONG, YOU CAN SURVIVING IT THERE ANYTHING. -- YOU CAN SURVIVE AND GET THROUGH ANYTHING. [APPLAUSE] >> WHEN SCOTT TOOK ON THE UNIONS OUR FAMILY BECAME THE TARGET OF VICIOUS AND PERSONAL ATTACKS. THREATS OF VIOLENCE WERE COMMON. AS THE MOTHER AND WIFE, I SPENT MANY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS WORRYING ABOUT MY FAMILY. DURING THE RECALL ELECTIONS ON ANY GIVEN DAY THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PROTESTING IN FRONT OF THE STATE CAPITAL. PROTESTING IN FRONT OF OUR PERSONAL HOME. [BOO'S) >> HE TOOK ON THE UNIONS INAND WON. SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN KEEP THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE MORE POWER. ISN'T THAT THE WAY WE WANT THINGS TO BE? [APPLAUSE] >> IT WAS NEVER EASY BUT IT WAS WORTH IT. AND WISCONSIN WINS WITH WALKER. [CHEERS] >> WE IN WISCONSIN ARE BETTER OFF TODAY AND WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. FAMILIES AND TAXPAYERS AND HARD-WORKING WISCONSIN MEN AND WOMEN WIN WITH WALKER. [CHEERS] >> OUR CONCERN NOW TURNS TO ALL OF AMERICA'S SONS AND DAUGHTERS. OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN DESERVE IN AMERICA IS GREAT IS WHAT WE WOULD -- EXPERIENCED OR EVEN BETTER. TODAY, AMERICA FACES CHALLENGES AT HOME AND ABROAD. MEETING THOSE CHALLENGES WILL REQUIRE BOLD, DECISIVE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP AND A PERSON WITH A PROVEN RECORD OF WINNING. SOMEONE WHO WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY ANYONE. STARTING TODAY, YOU AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MY HUSBAND, HIS ACHIEVEMENTS, HIS SERVICE, AND HIS STORY. I HOPE YOU'LL KNOW HIM AS THE LOVING HUSBAND, THOUGHTFUL FATHER, AND THE FEARLESS LEADER I KNOW AND LOVE. I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO SUPPORT MY HUSBAND'S CONSERVATIVE WORK TO BUILD A BETTER WISCONSIN AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WILL BUILD A BETTER AMERICA. [CHEERS] >> I AM SO VERY PROUD TO INTRODUCE MY HUSBAND TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT NATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE 45TH GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN AND THE PERSON I HOPE WILL BE THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SCOTT WALKER. (music) [APPLAUSE] (music) >> LIFE IS A HIGHWAY I WANT TO WRITE IT ALL MY LONG YOU'RE GOING MY WAY (music) [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. >> WE WANT SCOTT! WE WANT SCOTT! GOVERNOR WALKER: THANK YOU. I LOVE AMERICA. [CHEERS[ GOVERNOR WALKER: AS KIDS, MY BROTHER DAVID AND I USED TO WALK -- LOVE TO GO OVER AND VISIT ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS. MR. COTTON WAS A BIT OF A LEGEND IN OUR TOWN. HE HAD SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN WORLD WAR I AND WORLD WAR II. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: THEN, LIKE SO MANY OTHER VETERANS, HE CAME BACK AND SERVED HIS COMMUNITY. OVER THE YEARS WE USED 11 -- LOVE TO SEE HIM AT THE CONCESSION STAND DOWN THAT THE BASEBALL GAME. I GIVE HER MEMBER OVER THE YEARS BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY HE WOULD ORGANIZE ME AND ALL THE OTHER SCOUTS AS WE GO THROUGH AND PUT UP FLAGS ON THE GRAVES OF THE FALLEN. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AROUND HIM AND NOT SHARE HIS LOVE FOR GOD AND COUNTRY. I THINK BACK 30 YEARS AGO, HIS AMERICAN LEGION POST HELP ME ATTEND A PROGRAM CALLED ""AGGER BOY STATE."" I LEARNED ABOUT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I GOT THE CHANCE TO REPRESENT WISCONSIN AND A PROGRAM CALLED BOYS NATION. INTERNET -- THEN I MET A VIETNAM VETERAN NAMED BOB TURNER. BOB AND THE OTHER VETERANS IT RAN THE PROGRAM NOT ONLY TAUGHT US ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS, THEY SHARED THEIR LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND INSPIRED WITHIN THE THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SERVICE WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING OUR LIBERTIES. VETERANS LIKE THAT REMIND ME THAT WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT IS THE FACT THAT AMERICA IS A CAN-DO KIND OF COUNTRY. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON BUT JUST CAN'T QUITE THE SCENE TO GET -- QUITE SEEM TO GET THE JOB DONE. WASHINGTON, 68 SQUARE MILES SURROUNDED BY REALITY. THE GOOD NEWS IS IT IS NOT TOO LATE. WE CAN TURN THINGS AROUND.. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE KNEW, FRESH LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP WITH NEW IDEAS FROM OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON. THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT HAS HAD A GET THINGS DONE LIKE WE DID HERE IN WISCONSIN. WE TOOK ON THE UNIONS AND WE WON. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE LOWERED TAXES BY $2 BILLION. WE LOWERED IT ON INDIVIDUALS, EMPLOYERS, PROPERTY OWNERS. PROPERTY TAXES ARE LOWER THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. HOW MANY OTHER GOVERNORS CAN SAY THAT? [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: SINCE I'VE BEEN GOVERNOR, WE HAVE PASSED LAWSUIT REFORM AND REGULATORY REFORM. WE DEFUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND PASS PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE ENACTED THE CASTLE DOCTRINE AND CONCEAL CARRY SO WE CAN PROTECT OURSELVES, OUR FAMILIES, OUR PROPERTY. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND WE NOW REQUIRE A PHOTO ID TO VOTE IN THE STATE. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: IF OUR FORMS CAN WORK IN A BLUE STATE LIKE WISCONSIN. THEY CAN WORK ANYWHERE IN AMERICA. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: AS I TRAVEL THIS COUNTRY I HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY ARE FRUSTRATED WITH POLITICIANS TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY ARE AGAINST AND WHO THEY ARE AGAINST. AMERICA IS ONE OF -- WANT TO BE FOR SOMETHING IN FOR SOMEONE. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I AM FOR. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: I AM FOR REFORM, GROWTH, SAFETY. FOR TRANSFERRING POWER FROM WASHINGTON INTO THE HANDS OF HARD-WORKING TAXPAYERS IN STATES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT ISRAEL REFORM. -- THAT IS REAL REFORM. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: IN FOR BUILDING A BETTER ECONOMY THAT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO LIVE THEIR PIECE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND I AM FOR PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN FROM RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM ALL OVER THE WORLD. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: MY RECORD SHOWS THAT I KNOW HOW TO FIGHT AND WIN. NOW MORE THAN EVER, AMERICA NEEDS A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR AMERICA. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: SO FIRST LET ME TELL YOU WHY I AM FOR REAL REFORM IN WASHINGTON. OUR BIG REFORMS IN WISCONSIN TOOK THE POWER OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE BIG SPECIAL INTERESTS AND PUT THEM FOR THE -- FIRMLY INTO THE HANDS OF TAXPAYERS. PEOPLE WHO WERE ELECTED BY LOCAL PROPERTY TAXPAYERS LITERALLY RUN OUR SCHOOLS. THAT MEANS WE GOT RID OF THINGS LIKE SEEING YOUR 80 TENURE -- SENIORITY AND 10T ENURE. AND WE CAN PUT THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST IN OUR CLASSROOMS. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THINK ABOUT THAT. FOUR YEARS LATER THE GRADUATION RATES ARE UP. THIRD-GRADE READING SCORES ARE HIGHER. WISCONSIN ACP SCORES ARE NOW SECOND BEST IN THE COUNTRY -- ACT SCORES ARE NOW SECOND BEST IN THE COUNTRY. THAT GOES TO SHOW THE GOVERNMENT CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE IS GENERALLY THE BEST WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY WE NEED TO TAKE POWER AND MONEY OUT OF WASHINGTON AND SEND IT BACK TO OUR STATES FOR AREAS LIKE MEDICAID AND TRANSPORTATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: SADLY. WASHINGTON SEEMS TO THINK THAT SUCCESS IS MEASURED BY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT. [BOO'S] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE MEASURE SUCCESS BY THE OPPOSITE. BY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE UNDERSTAND THAT TRUE FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY DO NOT COME FROM THE MIGHTY HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT. THEY COME FROM EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN LIVES AND THEIR OWN DESTINIES. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT IS WHAT WE STAND FOR. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AS A KID. MY FIRST JOB WAS WASHING DISHES AT THE COUNTRYSIDE RESTAURANT. THAN I MOVED UP TO THE BIG TIME. I STARTED FLIPPING HAMBURGERS IN HIGH SCHOOL AT MCDONALD'S TO SAVE UP FOR COLLEGE. MY DAD WAS A SMALL-TOWN PREACHER AND MY MOM WAS A PART-TIME SECRETARY AND BOOKKEEPER. MY GRANDPARENTS WERE FARMERS WHO DID NOT HAVE INDOOR PLUMBING UNTIL MY MOM WENT OFF TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. MY DAD'S DAD WAS A MACHINIST FOR 42 YEARS DOWN IN ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS. MY BROTHER AND I THOUGHT BACK AND REALIZED WE DID NOT INHERIT FAME OR FORTUNE FROM A FAMILY. WHAT WE GOT WAS THE BELIEF THAT IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU PLAY BY THE RULES, YOU CAN DO ANY -- AND BE ANYTHING. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT'S RIGHT. THAT IF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THAT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. WHEN WE HELP PEOPLE, ADULTS WERE ABLE TO WORK TRANSITION FROM GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS TO INDEPENDENCE, WE HELP MORE PEOPLE LIVE THAT PIECE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN WISCONSIN THAT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO BE SIGNED UP FOR ONE OF OUR EMPLOYABILITY TRADE PROGRAMS. BEFORE THEY GET A LOT FOR CHECK. AND NOW WE MAKE THIS A REQUIREMENT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN PASS A DRUG TEST BEFORE THEY GO TO WORK. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT IS RIGHT. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE DEFENDERS OF THE STATUS QUO THOUGHT WHEN I PROPOSE THIS REFORMS. THEY SAID IT WAS MAKING IT HARDER TO GET GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. MY REPLY WAS NO, I AM MAKING IT EASIER TO GET A JOB. ISN'T THAT WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT? [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: STRONG FAMILIES ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS WHOLE ROLE AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN ARE RAISED IN A HOUSEHOLD WITH BOTH PARENTS INVOLVED THERE MORE LIKELY, TO FINISH SCHOOL GETTING A JOB, AND TO LIVE A LIFE FREE OF GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCE. WE NEED A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WILL ACTUALLY STAND UP AND SUPPORT STRONG FAMILIES BY GETTING RID OF THE MARRIAGE BILL, POLICIES, WELFARE POLICIES AND MAKE IT HARD FOR FATHERS TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN. WHEN YOU ENCOURAGE FAMILIES -- WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THINKING ABOUT MY OWN FAMILY, I KNOW FOR ME THAT BOTH MY PARENTS WERE SO IMPORTANT AS A GROUP IS KIDS. AND WE TRY TO BE GOOD ROLE MODELS FOR MATT AND ALEX AND THEY TURNED OUT PRETTY WELL. I'D SAY THEY WERE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE ARE SO PROUD OF THEM AND I THINK ABOUT MATT AND ALEX AND I THINK ABOUT ALL THE OTHERS OF THE GENERATION. FOR THEM, I WANT THEM TO GROW UP IN A MORE FREE AND PROSPEROUS COUNTRY. THAT IS REALLY ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: TO ENSURE THE PROSPERITY, WE NEED TO BE FOR A PRO-GROWTH ECONOMIC PLAN THAT ENABLES OUR INDIVIDUALS AND OUR FAMILIES TO EARN, TO SAVE, AND TO ACHIEVE THEIR PIECE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. THERE IS A REAL CONTEST OUT THERE. AND SET OF THE TOP-DOWN GOVERNMENT KNOWS BEST APPROACH THAT YOU HEAR FROM SO MANY IN WASHINGTON, WHEN YOU TO BUILD THE ECONOMY FROM THE GROUND UP IN A WAY THAT IS NEW AND FRESH, ORGANIC AND DYNAMIC THAT SAYS AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT VIOLATE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR, GO OUT AND START YOUR OWN CAREER. BUILD YOUR OWN BUSINESS. LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT IS FREEDOM. THE KIND OF FREEDOM THAT IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE HAVE A PLAN TO HELP MORE PEOPLE LIVE THAT DREAM. A PLAN THAT WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE CREATE MORE JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES. YOU DON'T WHAT IT STARTS WITH? WE NEED TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE ONCE AND FOR ALL. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE NEED TO REPEAL THE SO-CALLED AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND PUT PATIENTS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS, NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: MANY OF YOU HERE KNOW THAT WHEN IT BECAME GOVERNOR I LITERALLY ALLOWED THE STATE TO JOIN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE ON MY FIRST DAY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WON THE FIRST THEY WILL CALL ON CONGRESS TO ONCE AND FOR ALL REPEAL OBAMACARE ENTIRELY. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THEN WE NEED TO REIN IN THE OUT-OF-CONTROL FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE LIKE A BLANKET ON THE NATION'S ECONOMY. ENFORCE COMMON SENSE, BUT LET'S GET RID OF BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE. AS GOVERNOR I CALL FOR A MORATORIUM ON NEW REGULATIONS. WE CAN DO THE SAME IN WASHINGTON IN THE VACANT REPEAL ALL THE OTHER BAD OBAMA REGULATIONS TO GET THIS ECONOMY GOING AGAIN. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: NEXT, WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE IN ALL THE ABOVE ENERGY POLICY THAT SAYS WE WILL USE THE ABUNDANCE OF WHAT GOD IS GIVEN US HERE IN AMERICA AND ON THIS CONTINENT. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT IS RIGHT. WE ARE AN ENERGY RICH COUNTRY AND WE NEED -- WE CAN BITTERLY START REFUELING OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO ONE DAY ONE WILL PROVE -- APPROVE THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: APPROVE THAT PIPELINE AND PUT IN PLACE A PLAN TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY. THEN WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE GET THE EDUCATION AND THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED. BECAUSE WE KNOW IF YOU DO THAT WE CAN HELP PEOPLE FIND CAREERS THAT PAY FAR MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. HERE IN WISCONSIN WE REFORMED PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE PROVIDED MORE QUALITY CHOICES FOR FAMILIES. I TRUST FAMILIES AND I TRUST PARENTS TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION FOR THE CHILDREN. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: I BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD REGARDLESS OF THE ZIP CODE OR BACKGROUND OR WHAT THEIR PARENTS DO FOR A LIVING, I BELIEVE EVERY CHILD DESERVES ACCESS TO GREAT EDUCATION. BE AT A TRADITIONAL PUBLIC, CHARTER, CHOICE, PRIVATE, OR HOLMES SCHOOL EDUCATION. -- HOMESCHOOL EDUCATION. EVERY CHILD DESERVES A GREAT EDUCATION. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT IS WHAT I WANT -- ALONG WITH THAT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE HIGH STANDARDS. THOSE STANDARDS SHOULD BE SET AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. NO COMMON CORE. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT IS WHY I WILL WORK SO HARD TO TAKE POWER AND MONEY OUT OF WASHINGTON AND SEND IT BACK TO OUR STATEA IN OUR SCHOOLS WHERE IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT, AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THINK ABOUT THIS. IF YOU TAKE A DOLLAR OF YOUR PURSE OR WALLET, WHERE WOULD YOU RATHER SPEND? IN WASHINGTON OR AT YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL? I WOULD RATHER SPEND IT AT YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL AND IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE, WE WILL SEND US DOLLARS BACK TO HELP YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND THEN WE NEED TO LOWER THE BURDEN ON OUR TAXPAYERS SICU CAN KEEP MORE OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS -- SO YOU CAN KEEP MORE OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS. WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS JOB MAKERS -- CREATORS BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE IN THE WORLD SO THEY CAN WRING MORE JOBS BACK FROM OVERSEAS AND PUT MORE FELLOW AMERICANS BACK TO WORK HERE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: YOU KNOW WHAT? WE CAN DO IT. WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE WE DID IT IN WISCONSIN AND WE CAN DO IT IN WASHINGTON. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: SOME PEOPLE WONDER WHY I SPEND SO MUCH TIME FOCUSED ON LOWERING THE TAX BURDEN. SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT WE LIKE TO SHOP A KOHL'S. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED IF I'M GOING TO BUY A NEW SHIRT, I GO TO THE WRECK THAT SAYS IT WAS $29.99 AND NOTICED $19.99. WE GET OF THE INSERT FROM THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER OR MAYBE WE GET THE FLYER WE HAVE BACK AT HOME. IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY, 30% OFF. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AS THE CLERK IS RINGING IT UP, SHE'S GIVES INTO HER PURSE AND PULLS OUT SOME OF THAT COLD CASH -- KOHL'S CASH AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY ARE PAYING ME TO BUY THE SHIRT. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: NOT REALLY, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT. HAD IS A GREAT COMPANY LIKE THAT MAKE MONEY? THE MAKE IT OFF THE VOLUME. THE MAKE IT OFF THE VOLUME. THEY CAN CHARGE A HIGHER PRICE AND IF YOU'VE YOU CAN AFFORD IT, BUT THEY LOWER THE PRICE, BROADEN THE BASE, AND THEY MAKE MORE MONEY OFF OF VOLUME. THAT IS HOW IT THINK OF THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. THE GOVERNMENT CAN CHARGE A HIGHER RATE IN SOME COULD AFFORD IT, BUT IF YOU BROADEN THE BASE AND EXPAND THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: YEARS AGO WE USED TO CALL THAT -- A SIMILAR PLAN WAS SUCCESSFUL UNDER RONALD REAGAN. I CALL IT THE ""KOHL'S CURVE."" UNIT HAD TO SPEND YOUR MONEY BETTER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WILL BE DO IT WILL GET A LOT BETTER. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: TO PROSPER WE NEED TO LIVE IN A SAFE AND STABLE WORLD. THAT IS WHY I AM FOR TRUE SAFETY. COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HAS A SACRED DUTY TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN MY LIFETIME, THE BEST PRESIDENT WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY WAS A GOVERNOR FROM CALIFORNIA. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP WE REBUILT THE MILITARY. WE STOOD UP FOR ALLIES. WE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. AND WITHOUT APOLOGY, WE STOOD FOR AMERICAN VALUES. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT LED TO ONE OF THE MOST PEOPLE TIMES IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. SADLY, TODAY, UNDER THE OBAMA-CLINTON DOCTRINE AMERICA IS LEADING FROM BEHIND. THAT HAS IS HEADED TOWARDS DISASTER. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DREW A LINE IN THE SAND AND ALLOWED TO BE CROSSED. A PRESIDENT WHO THOUGHT ISIS WAS THE JV SQUAD, YEMEN A SUCCESS STORY, AND IRAN A PLACE WE DO BUSINESS WITH. [BOO'S] GOVERNOR WALKER: WHEN MY BROTHER AND I WERE KIDS WE USED TO TIE RIBBONS AROUND THE TREE IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE DURING THE 444 DAYS THAT IRAN HELD 52 AMERICANS HOSTAGE. ONE OF THOSE HOSTAGES WAS KEVIN PURDY WROTE DOWN THE WAY IN NO CREEK. HE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE HOSTAGES. A MARINE WHO WOULD JUST BEEN ASSIGNED TO SERVE IN THE U.S. EMBASSY. HE IS HERE TODAY WITH US. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: KEVIN KNOWS THAT IRAN IS NOT A PLACE TO DO BUSINESS WITH. IRAN HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE THE DAY HE AND THE OTHER HOSTAGES WERE RELEASED ON PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. LOOKING AHEAD, WE NEED TO TERMINATE THE BAD DEAL WITH IRAN ON THE VERY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE NEED TO TERMINATE THAT DEAL ON THE VERY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. PUT IN PLACE CRIPPLING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND CONVINCE OUR ALLIES TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: EARLIER THIS YEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA DECLARED, HE PROCLAIMED THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS IS GLOBAL WARMING, CLIMATE CHANGE. WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. THE GREATEST THREAT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS IS RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE CAN START BY LIFTING THE POLITICAL RESTRICTIONS ON OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL ALREADY IN IRAQ AND EMPOWER THEM TO HELP OUR KURD AND SUNNI ALLIES TO RECLAIM TERRITORY TAKEN BY ISIS. ON BEHALF OF YOUR CHILDREN IN MIND, I WOULD RATHER TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM UNTIL THEY BRING THE FIGHT US -- INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL THEY BRING THE FIGHT US. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE NEED TO A KNOWLEDGE THAT ISRAEL IS AN ALLY AND START TREATING ISRAEL LIKE AN ALLY. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: THERE SHOULD BE NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THAT IS WHY EARLY THIS YEAR WHEN I WENT TO ISRAEL I NOT ONLY MET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, I MET WITH THE OPPOSITION LEADER TO LET THEM KNOW THAT IF I WERE PRESIDENT THERE WOULD BE NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL GOING FORWARD. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE NEED TO STOP THE AGGRESSION OF RUSSIA. PUTIN BELIEVES IN THE OLD LINEN PRINCIPLE, THAT YOU PROBE WITH BAYONETS. UNDER OBAMA AND CLINTON, HE HAS FOUND HOLD OF MUSH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. -- FEW YEARS. THE UNITED STATES NEEDS A FOREIGN POLICY THAT WILL PUT STEEL IN FRONT OF OUR ENEMIES. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE NEED TO STOP CHINA'S CYBERATTACKS, SLOW THEIR ADVANCES INTO INTERNATIONAL WATERS, AND SPEAK OUT ABOUT THEIR ABYSMAL HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS HERE AND ABROAD AND THOSE OF OUR ALLIES. THAT BEGINS BY REBUILDING THE DEFENSE BUDGET BY GOING BACK TO THE LEVELS PROPOSED BY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GATES. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE NEED TO HONOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM BY GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE US SAFE AND GOING FOR IT BY GIVING THEM THE QUALITY AND TIMELY HEALTH CARE THAT THEY DESERVE WHEN EVERY -- RETURN HOME -- WHEN THEY RETURN HOME. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: MOST OF ALL THE BEST WAY WE CAN HONOR THEM IS BY FIGHTING TO WIN. THIS IS IMPORTANT. OUR GOAL SHOULD BE PEACE, BUT THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN AMERICA MUST FIGHT. IF WE MUST, AMERICANS FIGHT TO WIN. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: GOING FORWARD THE WORLD MUST KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO GREATER FRIEND AND NO WORSE ENEMY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AMERICA IS A GREAT COUNTRY. IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE JUST HAVE TO START LEADING AGAIN. IS NOT TOO LATE. WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. VETERANS LIKE BOB TURNER REMIND ME THAT WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT, WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL, WHAT MAKES US THE GREATEST COUNTRY AND ALL OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN ALL THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. IN TIMES OF CRISIS. BEAT ECONOMIC OR PHYSICAL, MILITARY OR SPIRITUAL, THERE HAVE BEEN MEN AND WOMEN OF COURAGE TO OF BEEN WILLING TO STAND UP AND THINK MORE ABOUT FUTURE GENERATIONS THAN THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR OWN POLITICAL FUTURES. LADIES AND HIM AND, -- GENTLEMEN, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE WANT OUR SONS, MATT AND ALEX, AND ALL THE OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS LIKE THEM TO GROW UP IN A COUNTRY THAT IS AS GREAT, AS GREAT AS THE COUNTRY WE INHERITED. AMERICANS DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR THEM. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: SOMEONE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: SOMEONE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR A RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS AND ALL OF HER OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. [CHEERS] -- OUR OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. SOMEONE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR AMERICA. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER YOU COME FROM A BIG CITY OR SUBURB OR SMALL-TOWN. I WILL FIGHT IN WIN FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: HEALTHY OR SICK, BORN OR UNBORN, I WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR YOU. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: JUNCKER OLD OR ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN -- YOUNG OR OLD OR ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN, I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. [CHEERS] GOVERNOR WALKER: OVER THE YEARS I HAVE MET SOME AMAZING PEOPLE. MANY OF WHOM HAVE COME HERE FROM OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, TO A PERSON, THEY TELL ME THE REASON THEY CAME HERE WAS NOT TO BECOME -- THE REASON DAVID -- THEY CAME HERE WAS BECAUSE AMERICA IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES LEFT IN THE WORLD WHERE IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT CLASS YOU ARE BORN INTO OR WHAT YOUR PARENTS DID FOR A LIVING.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327146-1/hillary-clinton-town-hall-dover-new-hampshire,"Hillary Clinton Town Hall in Dover, New Hampshire",Hillary Rodham Clinton,"COMMITTEE.AY. UNDER THE PLAN COMPANIES THAT SHARE THEIR PROFITS WITH EMPLOYEES WOULD RECEIVE A TWO YEAR TAX CREDIT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE GOAL OF BOOSTING EMPLOYEE WAGES AND MOTIVATING WORKERS. THE FORMER SECRETARY SECRETARY OF STATE TALKED ABOUT THE PLAN AT A TOWN HALL MEETING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THIS IS JUST OVER AN HOUR. >> HELLO DOVER. WOW WILL HAVE TO DO A MICROPHONE ADJUSTMENT. HOW HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING THIS AFTERNOON? FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME I AM OF FORMER TEACHER AND MAYOR OF THE CITY OF DOVER. I I AM SERVING ON THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT TODAY. WE ALL KNOW WHY WE ARE HERE. I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND TALK A MINUTE ABOUT, IF I COULD, ABOUT DOVER AND THE SPECIAL PLACE DOVER PLAYS IN CLINTON'S LIFE. THIS IS THE FIRST TOWN HALL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR HILLARY. [APPLAUSE]. I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER PLACE TO DO IT. DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? [APPLAUSE]. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION, ACTUALLY I WAS TOLD TO MENTION A LOT OF THINGS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THAT LONG HISTORY, HISTORY IS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO RELY ON WHEN WE GO TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THROUGH MY EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST 40 YEARS OF BEING IN THE PUBLIC LIGHT I HAVE NEVER HAD A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE THE CLINTONS WHO WORKED HARD FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. [APPLAUSE]. SO HILLARY IS HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH. SHE IS HERE TO TALK AND TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING OUR ECONOMY, AND YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS WHOLE PROMISE HERE IN AMERICA AND THAT PROMISE IS THAT IF WE ALL WORK HARD, AND WE PLAY BY THE RULES, THAT WE CAN GET AHEAD. FOR THE FEW FOLKS WHO DON'T KNOW ME, I'VE RUN A BUSINESS FOR 40 YEARS. I RUN A POOR MAN'S MARINA HERE IN DOVER. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE OLD SAYING THAT A RISING TIDE FLOATS ALL BOATS, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE GREATEST EXPANSION IN PEACE TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II IS DURING THE TIME THAT THE CLINTONS FROM ARKANSAS OCCUPIED THE WHITE HOUSE [APPLAUSE]. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT IN DOVER WE ARE STILL MEMBERS OF THE WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES AND WE NEED AN ALLY. WE NEED AN ALLY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY WON'T FORGET WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND I CAN TELL YOU, YOU HAVE MY WORD, THAT, THAT THEY HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN WHERE THEY CAME FROM. [APPLAUSE]. SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER A RISING TIDE, I'M IN THE BOAT BUSINESS SO I KNOW THIS, RISING TIDE FLOATS ALL BOATS, WE NEED A NEW RISING TIDE IN AMERICA AND IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE YOU THAT PERSON WILL BRING THAT TIDE. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES [APPLAUSE]. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH [APPLAUSE]. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. THANK YOU, WOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GEORGE AND I DO HAVE A REALLY SOFT SPOT IN MY HEART FOR DOVER. THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE HERE WHICH I'M THRILLED TO SEE. IT LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THEM WEREN'T BORN IN 1992, THE FIRST TIME I CAME TO DOVER, BUT I REMEMBER IT SO WELL. THANK YOU FOR GATHERING TODAY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL SUMMER DAY FOR THIS TOWN HALL. RIGHT BEFORE I CAME IN, I WAS TOLD THAT THE DOVER BABE RUTH UNDER 16 GIRLS SOFTBALL TEAM JUST WON THE STATE [APPLAUSE]. I PLAYED SOFTBALL A LONG TIME AGO. THE LAST TEAM I PLAYED ON IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS SPONSORED BY THE LOCAL CANDY DISTRIBUTOR AND THE CANDY DISTRIBUTOR GOT TO NAME THE TEAM THAT HE SPONSORED SO WE WERE THE GOOD AND PLENTY. [LAUGHTER] HE KINDLY SUGGESTED THAT WE WEAR A UNIFORM THAT CORRESPOND TO THE COLOR OF THE CANDY. BLACK, WHITE AND PINK. REMEMBER? WE DID. I'M ESPECIALLY PLEASED THAT THAT TEAM IS NOW AT REGIONALS AND I WISH THEM WELL. I HOPE TODAY TO TALK TO ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND HEAR FROM YOU ON THAT ISSUE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT BE ON YOUR MIND. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT I GAVE A SPEECH THIS PAST MONDAY ABOUT WHAT IS AT THE CENTER OF MY ECONOMIC AGENDA AND THAT IS RAISING INCOME FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE]. MAKING THE MIDDLE CLASS MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN. HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE STRETCHED SO THIN WITH THEIR BUDGET BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR DAILY A EXPENSES AND SAVE FOR THE FUTURE. THIS IS THE WORST FISCAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN AMERICA. IT TOOK A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR PEOPLE TO PULL THEMSELVES OUT OF THE DITCH WE WERE IN. IT ALSO TOOK GOOD LEADERSHIP FROM A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE PRES. OBAMA DOESN'T GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR DIGGING US OUT OF THAT DITCH. YOU KNOW, IN FACT THERE IS A PATTERN HERE. WE HAVE HAD, HAVE HAD, IN THE LAST 35 YEARS, FIVE PRESIDENTS. EACH OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS INHERITED PROBLEMS. ECONOMIC ECONOMIC AND OTHER PROBLEMS BUT FOCUSING JUST ON THE ECONOMY, FROM THEIR PREDECESSOR. I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHEN RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION MY PRESIDENTS SAID TO BE THAT DEFICIT IS A LOT WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. I REMEMBER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA ABOUT A WEEK AFTER HE WON AND HE WAS ASKING ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE AND HE STARTED BY SAYING YOU KNOW, THE ECONOMY IS A LOT WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. WE KNOW IT TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK TO GET THE ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN. AS YOU HEARD GEORGE SAY, I'M VERY PROUD THAT DURING MY HUSBAND'S ADMINISTRATION WE DID HAVE THE LONGEST PEACETIME ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY, 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. I'M VERY PROUD THAT NOW PRES. OBAMA AND THE HARD WORK OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REVERSED LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. WE RECOVERED MORE THAN 12000 JOBS. WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WERE WERE STANDING BUT WERE NOT RUNNING YET. IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT FIGURE OUT HOW WE TAKE THE GAME OF THE TWO TERMS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND BUILD A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR RAISING INCOME FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE CONTRAST IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION, IN MANY WAYS, WILL, WILL BE ABOUT. EVERYBODY RUNNING ON THE OTHER SIDE HAS A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC PHILOSOPHY. THEY REALLY STILL BELIEVE THAT IF YOU CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, IF YOU LIFT REGULATION ON CORPORATIONS, THAT SOMEHOW ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WILL TRICKLE DOWN TO ALL THE REST OF US. WELL, WE HAVE TRIED THAT. WE. WE TRIED IT AND IT DIDN'T WORK. YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING, FOOL ME ONCE SHAME ON YOU, FOR ME TWICE SHAME ON ME. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG DEBATE IN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT WHAT ECONOMIC POLICY TO FOLLOW. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE ENGAGED AND THE AS INFORMED AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. THERE'S NO PLACE MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAT THAN RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THAT'S WHY ON MONDAY, I LAID OUT A THREE STRATEGY FOR STRONG GROWTH. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE GROWTH OR FAIRNESS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH. THE WAY WE DO THAT, THE WAY WE DO THAT IS GETTING BACK TO BASICS. OF COURSE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WILL BE MAKING THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, ABOUT WHAT WORKED, WHAT THE EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT WORKS IS AND HOW WE CAN HOPEFULLY WORK TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT THOSE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO. MAKE SURE WE FINALLY THE WOMEN EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. [SPEAKING IN NATIVE TONGUE] AND I AM GOING TO SAY, THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE. THIS IS A FAMILY ECONOMIC ISSUE. IF PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING PAID FAIRLY THAT HURTS EVERYBODY, THE SMALL BUSINESS THAT DOES NOT GET ENOUGH CUSTOMERS BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD WITH THERE SELLING. I MEAN, THAT IS A GROWTH STRATEGY'S.A GROWTH STRATEGY. THE MORE WE EQUALIZE WHAT PEOPLE ARE PAID ACCORDING TO THERE OWN EFFORT THE BETTER OFF WE WE WILL BE. OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGY WE MUST MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WE WILL GROW OUR ECONOMY AND RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS BEYOND MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE HAVING A PARTISANA PARTISAN BATTLE IN CONGRESS. WE ARE IN A GLOBAL COMPETITION. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE INVESTING IN THERE INFRASTRUCTURE COMMAND I DO NOT MEAN THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COME AS IMPORTANT AS THAT IS THE MORE ROADS AND AIRPORTS AND BRIDGES. I MEAN OUR VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED TO GET AFFORDABLE QUALITY BROADBAND'S EVERYPLACE THIS COUNTRY JUST AS WE HAVE ELECTRICITY. NOW, THEY'RE IS ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. I REALLYI REALLY THINK OUR CORPORATIONS ARE MISSING A BIG BET. BECAUSE CREDIBLE STUDIES, QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH THAT PROFIT-SHARING WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES IS GOOD FOR THE EMPLOYEES, GOOD FOR THE BUSINESSES, GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY. II WANT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE COMPANIES TO DO JUST THAT. WE HAVEWE HAVE SOME GREAT EXAMPLES ARE NEW HAMPSHIRE. ONE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH. YOU KNOW, MARKET BASKETS PROVIDE PROFIT-SHARING FOR EMPLOYEES WHO WORK MORE THAN A THOUSAND HOURS A YEAR. FOR BOTH FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME EMPLOYEES. II AM PRETTY PROUD OF THAT AND THINK THAT IT MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE. AND WHAT YOU HERE FROM COMPANIES THAT, YOU NO WHAT, THIS INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY, LOYALTY OF EMPLOYEES. IT GIVES YOU A BOND WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES. THEY WILL WORK HARDER, LOOK FOR MORE THINGS TO DO TO IMPROVE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE STORES. THAT IS JUST COMMON SENSE. TREAT SOMEONE LIKE TO HAVE A STAKE IN YOUR BUSINESS AND THEY WILL STAND UP STRAIGHTER, WORK A LITTLE HARDER, MAKE A DIFFERENCE. A DIFFERENCE. THEY'RE IS ANOTHER COMPANY HERE IN PORTSMOUTH, PACK WORLD INVESTMENTS. AND JOE STARTED THIS COMPANY AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY AND IS ALSO A BIG BELIEVER IN PROFIT-SHARING. HE PROVIDES PROFIT-SHARING TO HIS EMPLOYEES. SO I WANT US TO TRY TO CONVINCE MORE COMPANIES TO DO JUST THAT. I AM PROPOSING A RISING INCOME SHARING PROFIT TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE PROFIT-SHARING BY GIVING THOSE COMPANIES A 15 PERCENT TAX CREDIT OF THE AMOUNT OF THE PROFIT-SHARING FOR TWO YEARS TO GET THAT STARTED AND TO SEE THAT IT WORKS LIKE SO MANY OF THE OTHER COMPANIES THAT ALREADY DO IT [APPLAUSE] >> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT BY PROVIDING EXAMPLES AND INCENTIVES AND COMPARING WHAT WORKS TO WHAT DOES WORK JUST LIKE ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT WORK AND DON'T WORK, CORPORATE POLICIES THAT WORK AND DON'T WORK, WE HAVE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB USING INFORMATION AS A TOOL FOR CHANGING CORPORATE BEHAVIOR"" THE PURPOSE. ITIT IS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE CAN BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT WHEN I'M PRESIDENT. AND I BELIEVE THAT IF WE DO MORE OF THAT WE WILL SEND A VERY STRONGA VERY STRONG SIGNAL. I WE WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT CORPORATE PURPOSE NEXT WEEK ABOUT WE NEED TO GET BUSINESSES BACK LOOKING AFTER THERE EMPLOYEES AND THERE CUSTOMERS AND THERE COMMUNITIES AND OUR COUNTRY, NOTCOUNTRY, NOT JUST THEIR EXECUTIVES AND SHAREHOLDERS. THEY'RE HAS GOT TO BE -- [APPLAUSE] THEY'RE HAS GOT TO BE A RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS MORE IN IT FOR ALL OF US IF WE DO IT LIKE THAT. AND SOAND SO THEREFORE I AM GOING TO BE PRESENTING A LOT OF PLANS THAT I HOPE WILL FIND FAVOR 1st WITH VOTERS AND THEN AS PRESIDENT WITH THOSE WHO I AM GOING TO TRY TO INFLUENCE BY INCENTIVIZING BUT EVENTUALLY BY CHANGING LAWS IF THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES SO THAT WE HAVE MORE HAVE AN ECONOMIC APPROACH THAT REFLECTS HOW LUCKY BUSINESSES ARE TO BE OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITH ALL THE WE PROVIDE THE SUPPORT WE GIVE, THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS PART OF OUR NATIONAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE IN THE FORWARD IT TO WORK MORE AS PARTNERS AND NOT HAVE AN ADVERSARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR ECONOMY AND OUR SOCIETY. I BELIEVE THE ABILITY OF THE ECONOMY TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND GET OUR DEMOCRACY TOWORK FOR EVERYBODY COMMAND IT WILL REQUIRE CHANGES IN BOTH. [APPLAUSE] SO I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN.CAMPAIGN. HE CITED BELOW WE CAN DO TOGETHER. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ELECTIONS THAT WE WILL SET THE COURSE FOR THE REST OF THE CENTURY COMMAND WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT. WE CANNOT GO BACKWARDS. WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS NOT LEFT TO RIGHT SOME MUCH AS IT IS FORWARD OR BACKWARD COMMAND WE WE WILL GO FORWARD. [APPLAUSE] SO WITH THAT LET'S START WITH YOUR QUESTIONS. THEY CAN BE ABOUT ANYTHING. ANYTHING. THE FIRSTHAND AS I GO UP WAS THIS YOUNG WOMAN EITHER. >> MY NAME IS BRENDA BOUCHARD. I HAVE BEEN A CAREGIVER FOR MY HUSBAND FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS. HE HAS ANGER ONSET ALZHEIMER'S. MY MOTHER IS ALMOST 89. I AM ONE OF 65,000 ALZHEIMER'S CARE GIVERS IN THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NO FIRSTHAND THE PAIN OF SEEING SOMEONE'S THE BOY TO THIS DISEASE. I NO THE FINANCIAL BURDEN IS DISEASE CARRIES FOR FAMILIES AS WELL AS OUR COUNTRY. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, IN YOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND BEYOND WHAT WE WILL YOU DO TO ENSURE THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE AND THE POTENTIAL BANKRUPTCY TO MEDICARE MEDICAID WILL GET THE ATTENTION IT NEEDS. >> LET ME THANK YOU.YOU. LET ME REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CAREGIVING AND YOUR CARE. [APPLAUSE] I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID. 65,000 CAREGIVERS RIGHT HERE IN ONE STATE AND MULTIPLY THAT MANY, MANY, MANY TIMES OVER. WE HAVE A CAREGIVING CRISIS. WE HAVE SOWE HAVE SO MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING EITHER FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME CARE FOR THOSE THEY LOVE, SPOUSES, CHILDREN , THEIR AGING PARENTS OR OTHER RELATIVES . TO COME. NEW LINE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT YOU AND THE IMPORTANT WORK YOU ARE DOING IN YOUR HOME. I WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS. WITH RESPECT SPECIFICALLY ALZHEIMER'S I AM 100% COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE RESEARCH THAT GOES AND ALZHEIMER'S. ONE OF THE REAL UNFORTUNATE SETBACKS FROM THE CUTBACKS IN THE CONGRESS IS THAT SO MUCH OF THE HEALTH RESEARCH DONE BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND OTHER FIRST-RATE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN CUT BACK. I WAS TALKING TO A SCIENTIST THE OTHER DAY WHO SAID THAT WHEN THE CONGRESS CUT THE MONEY FOR THE NIH AND OTHERS LITERALLY LABS WERE CLOSE, YOUNG SCIENTISTS WERE LAID OFF, AND IT STOPPED PROGRESS IN A NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT EFFORTS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ALZHEIMER'S. WE HAVE TO GET BACK FUNDING OUR RESEARCH AND SCIENCE AGENDA AND IN PARTICULAR OUR RESEARCH INTO DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S BECAUSE WE ARE WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE BRINK OF MAKING SOME BREAKTHROUGHS SECONDLY, I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY MEDICARE TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVING THAT IS GIVEN BY RELATIVE. NOW, PEOPLE WORRY, HOW DO YOU MAKE THE JUDGMENT. WE COULDWE COULD PAY FOR A VISITING NURSE, PAY FOR SOMEBODY COMING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE, BUT HOW DO WE PROVIDE SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE WOMAN TAKING CARE OF HER HUSBAND AND MOTHER. I THINK THERE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE THAT OUT COMMAND I THINK OUR FAILURE TO DO SO WILL ACTUALLY END UP COSTING MORE MONEY BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU ARE DOING. THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT, SO THEY TURN AND SAY, I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE DEPENDENT CHILDREN AT HOME. I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING BECAUSE MY HUSBAND NO LONGER CAN. AND SO I CANNOT DO ANY OF THE CAREGIVING. I HAVE GOT TO GO INTO THE FORMAL WORKPLACE. WELL, THEN SOMEBODY IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME IN AND HELP, THAT'S GOING TO COST MONEY. WHY CAN'T WE BE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE SUPPORT THE FAMILY CAREGIVERS IN ADDITION TO THE NONFAMILY CAREGIVERS.CAREGIVERS. AND I AM WORKING VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT BECAUSE CLEARLY THE COST PROJECTED INTO THE FUTURE IS QUITE SUBSTANTIAL. BUT AS A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS TAKING CARE OF HER HUSBAND SAID TO ME NOT SO LONG AGO, IF EVERY FAMILY CAREGIVER STOPPED WORKING TOMORROW HE WOULD HAVE TO FIND ABOUT $350 BILLION WORTH OF CARE TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. SO LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT AND DON'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST FAMILY CAREGIVERS. WE ALSO NEED TO GIVE YOU MORE RESPITE CARE. THEY'RE HAS TO BE A PROGRAM FOR RESPITE CARE. [APPLAUSE] TOO MANY PEOPLE DO THE WORK DO IT OUT OF LOVE, DEVOTION, BUT IT IS A 247 JOB AND THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO THE STORE, HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH A FRIEND, GET THE HAIR FIXED. THEY'LL HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING UNLESS THERE IS SOME RESPITE CARE IN THE HOME OR IN ANOTHER FACILITY. AND FINALLY, THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY AS I'M LOOKING AT AN IDEA THAT I HEARD ABOUT RECENTLY, THE CARE CORE. HERE IS WHAT I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO. IN EVERY COMMUNITY HAVE A COORDINATING MECHANISM SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED IN HOW THEY WOULD CARE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS ALZHEIMER'S OR ANY OTHER AILMENT COULD BE ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS WILLING TO COME IN TO YOUR HOME FOR A CERTAIN TIME. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE TIRED, A LOT OF RETIRED NURSES AND TEACHERS, TEACHERS,TEACHERS, BUSINESS PEOPLE AND OTHERS WHO LOOK FOR VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES. AND I THINK IF WE HAD A CARE CORE WHERE WE HOPED TO FIND JUST A MECHANISM, MAYBE THE ONLINE REQUEST, MAYBE THE TELEPHONE LINE, MAYBE LINE, MAYBE SOMEBODY TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT, WE COULD HELP SUPPLEMENT WHAT MIGHT BE DONE BY BOTH THE FAMILY AND PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS. BUT THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE, AND AS YOU CAN TELL I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT. MY LATE MOTHER LIVED WITH US UNTIL SHE PASSED AWAY, AND SHE WAS THANKFULLY IN GOOD HEALTH, BUT SHE HAD SOME REAL BEGINNINGS OF DETERIORATION PHYSICALLY. SO I AM WELL AWARE OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RAISING IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] WELL, IWELL, I AM GOING TO GET TO AS MANY QUESTIONS AS I CAN. USE MYUSE MY MICROPHONE. >> MY NAME IS MARIE, A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT FROM DOVER. I HAVE A QUESTION. I AM INVOLVED WITH THE LG BT COMMUNITY AND KNOW THAT GAY MARRIAGE WAS JUST LEGALIZE IN ALL 50 STATES,50 STATES, AND I DON'T WANT TO UNDERMINE THAT. THAT'S AWESOME. BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU SPECIFICALLY WERE GOING TO DO ABOUT ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAWS IN THE WORKPLACE. I DON'T WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED TO SOMEONE OF THE SAME GENDER BUT ALSO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN MY WORKPLACE. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELL, YOU AREWELL, YOU ARE RIGHT. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY HISTORIC MILESTONE. AND I THINK IT IS WORTH IT IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST LOOKING AT THE DECISION BECAUSE IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL DECISION THAT MORE THAN THAT IT IS AA DECISION ABOUT HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER, RESPECT EACH OTHER, ACKNOWLEDGE. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE LONELY. PEOPLE CAN HAVE RELATIONSHIPS: LOVE ONE ANOTHER. IT WAS QUITE A MOVING DECISION. YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE NEXT BIG CHALLENGE, AND THAT IS DISCRIMINATION. WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE SUPPORTED THE END OF LAW, TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE BASED IN THOSE DAYS AS WE USED TO SAY ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AND WE DO HAVE TO DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE END DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE IN PARTICULAR. SO I AM COMMITTED TO THAT. I WE WILL WORK FOR THAT. AS PRES. I WE WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET IT ENACTED INTO LAW. [APPLAUSE] >> MAYBE WE CAN GET A MICROPHONE. HERE COMES ONE. THE ROOM GOT OVERCROWDED. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE MICROPHONE SET UP AND THEN WE PUT IN MORE CHAIRS. >> THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WORK YOU ARE DOING. ANYWAY, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE PROBLEM THAT CORPORATIONS ARE HAVING TOO MUCH ABILITY TO WRITE THE RULES IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS ISTHIS IS RELATED TO THAT, BUT THE CITY OF DOVER, ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAS GOTTEN A GRANT TO ACQUIRE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN THISGOVERNMENT. IN THIS CASE AND OUR MOTOR VEHICLE CALLED THE BEARCAT MANUFACTURED BY COMPANY, LANCOME. LANCOME ACTIVELY HELP CITIES FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE PAPERWORK SO THAT THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR THE MONEY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WILL AND PROVIDE SO THAT THEY CAN GET THESE MILITARY VEHICLES WHICH THEN CAUSE CAUSED PROBLEMS WITH COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND COMMUNITIES WITH THE POLICE START TO ACT PERHAPS MORE LIKE MILITARY FORCES IS SET OF PEOPLE PROTECTING THE COMMITTEE. MY QUESTION IS, WHAT STEPS WILL YOU TAKE TO MAKE SURE OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DO NOT BECOME JUST ANOTHER PROFIT CENTER FOR THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX? [APPLAUSE] >> YOU KNOW, THAT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION ON SEVERAL LEVELS, ONE OF WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED. AND ALSO BECAUSE THE MILITARIZATION OF LOCAL POLICE HAS BEEN IN MANY WAYS A PROBLEM OVERA PROBLEM OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH SOME OF THE INCIDENTS THAT WE HAVE HAD IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OUT AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK HARD AT PREVENTING THE MILITARIZATION OF LOCAL POLICE FORCES. AND THAT MEANS A LOT OF THIS HEAVY MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT WAS EITHER ALREADY MANUFACTURED OR MANUFACTURED AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 WHICH IS NOW MADE AVAILABLE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY END OF THE. LET ME MAKE THIS. PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. I WAS THEY'RE BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, HOURS THE NEXT DAY SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN NEW YORK AND AS PART OF THE EFFORT TO TRY TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY THROUGH THE KNEW DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY A LOT OF MONEY WAS APPROPRIATED THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT COULD THEN BE USED BY CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA. I THINK IT WAS TOO BROAD. I THINK IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY LASTING TOO LONG SO THAT IT IS STILL GOING ON AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY. I THINK THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHETHER WE NEED TO BE PAYING FOR AND SUBSIDIZING THE TRANSFER OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THERE STILL MAY BE PLACES WHERE IT IS WARRANTED BUT I, BUT I THINK IT HAS GONE TOO FAR AND NEEDS TO BE ARRAIGNED IN. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> SO MANY HANDS. THE GUYS AT MY BACK THE WHOLE TIME. AND HERE COMES A MICROPHONE IN A HURRY. >> SEC., THANK YOU FOR COMING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SPEAKING TO US TODAY. YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT BUILDING OUR FUTURE IN THIS COUNTRY. AS A YOUNG PERSON I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE TO OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. SCIENTISTS HAVE SHOWN WE NEED TO KEEP IT WAS AT THE FOSSIL FUELS ON THE GROUND TO PREVENT THE 2 DEGREES CELSIUS WARMING WHICH WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES AROUND THE GLOBE. MY QUESTION IS, YOU COMMIT TO BANNING FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION OF PUBLIC LAND FROM THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS WHERE 70 PERCENT OF FOSSIL FUELS. YES OR NO? >> THE ANSWER IS NOT UNTIL WE HAVE THE ALTERNATIVES IN PLACE. THAT MAY NOT BE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO YOU, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A RESPONSIBLE ANSWER. I AM 100 PERCENT IN FAVOR OF ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLAR WIND, ADVANCED BIOFUEL, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, EVERYTHING WE CAN DO. [APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD GET TO THE.THAT YOU MADE COLLEGES LOOKING AT PUBLIC LAND AND CUTTING BACK OVER TIME, PHASING OUT THE EXTRACTION OF FOSSIL FUEL, BUT I WILL SAY THIS : WE STILL HAVE TO RUN OUR ECONOMY,ECONOMY, TURN ON THE LIGHTS HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT BUSINESSES OPERATE. I WANT TO DO IS MUCH AS I CAN AS QUICKLY AS I CAN TO MAKE THIS ENERGY TRANSITION, BUT I COULD NOT RESPONSIBLY SAY TO YOU THAT I COULD AUTOMATICALLY STOP THE SOURCE OF FOSSIL FUELS RIGHT AWAY WITHOUT HAVING A SUBSTITUTE IN ORDER TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE EMPLOYED, TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. BUT YOUR LARGER.REALLY BEARS REPEATING. CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. CLIMATE THREAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. EVERYBODY ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO SAYS TO YOU THAT -- [APPLAUSE] THEY SAY YOU WHEN YOU ASKED THEM ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, I AM NOT A SCIENTIST. WHY DON'T YOU START LISTENING TO THE SCIENTISTS? [APPLAUSE] >> HOW ARE YOU? JUST WANT TO ASK YOU. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE QUESTION] >> AM GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE THINK THE STUDENT LOAN PROBLEMS JUST A YOUNG PERSON PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF WENT BACK TO SCHOOL TO GET ADDITIONAL EDUCATION BUT A LOT OF PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS ARE COSIGNING AND GUARANTEEING AND TAKING OUT STUDENT LOANS, SOMETIMES MORTGAGING THEIR HOME IN ORDER TO DO SO. THIS IS A MULTIGENERATIONAL PROBLEM. PROBLEM. WE HAVE $1.2 TRILLION IN OUTSTANDING STUDENT DEBT HELD BY 40 MILLION AMERICANS THIS IS A TERRIBLE DRAG ON INDIVIDUALS, A BUDGET BUSTER FOR SO MANY INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES, AND IT'S BAD FOR THE ECONOMY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WEIGHTED DOWN CAN START A BUSINESS, CAN'T BUY A HOUSE. I'VE HAD YOUNG PEOPLE TELL ME THEY CAN'TCAN AFFORD TO GET MARRIED BECAUSE OF THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT. HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO, REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT WITH INTEREST RATE IS TOO HIGH COMPARED TO THE REAL INTEREST RATE. [APPLAUSE] AND I WE WILL BE ROLLING OUT A SPECIFIC PLAN FOR REFINANCING GO WITH THE PAYMENT THAT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL BUDGET STRAIN ON THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET. WE HAVE TO DO IT. I DON'T SEE ANY WAY OUT. THE INTEREST RATES ARE TOO HIGH TO BEGIN WITH, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DID NOT REFLECT THE REAL INTEREST RATE. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE TO GET TO COLLEGE TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE. IT HAS TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE. AND I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT HOW YOU HAVE TO DEFER PAYMENT BECAUSE YOUR PAYING A FLAT RATE BASED ON THE 6 PERCENT INTEREST RATE. SO WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL I HAD TO BORROW MONEY. I DIDN'T HAVE MONEY. MY DAD SAID I CAN HELP YOU GO TO COLLEGE. IF YOU GO TO LAW SCHOOL YOUR ON YOUR OWN. I WORKED, GOT A SCHOLARSHIP FOR BUT I BORROWED MONEY. I DIDN'T ON A PLAN THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME AND MY HUSBAND AT THE TIME MY FRIEND, BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME BORROW MONEY TO AND WE SIGNED UP FOR AN INCOME CONTINGENT REPAYMENT PLAN. IN OTHER WORDS, I WANT TO WORK OF LAW SCHOOL FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. I DID NOT GOES ON NOT GO SOME BIG LAW FIRM. I THINK I MADE $14,000 A YEAR. WE PAID BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME SO THAT WE DID NOT HAVE TO DEFER PAYMENTS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A HIGH INTEREST RATE THAT WAS LITERALLY CAUSING US TO HAVE TO CROWD OUT OTHER OBLIGATIONS. I WANT TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE WITH ACCESS TO INCOME CONTINGENCY REPAIRED PROGRAMS. [APPLAUSE] AND I BELIEVE AT A CERTAIN TIME PARTICULARLY IF YOU DO THE PUBLIC SERVICE THING, GO BACK TO THE WOMAN WITH THE ALL-TIME CHALLENGES, IF YOU BECOME A SOCIAL WORKER, FIREFIGHTER, POLICE OFFICER, TEACHER: IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE JOB, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE YOUR LOAN FORGIVEN AFTER A CERTAIN. OF TIME. [APPLAUSE] AND IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER KIND OF EMPLOYMENT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT HOW WE GET THE INTEREST RATE DOWN TO GET THE PLANET -- THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE DOWN AND LICK OF FORGIVENESS EVENTUALLY. THINK OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. $1.2 TRILLION. THINK OF WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN GOING INTO THE ECONOMY. I THINK WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S A REALLY GOOD TRADE OFF IF WE MAKE IT. HE WE WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE HOW WE REFINANCE AND MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. [APPLAUSE] >> HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE. I'M SORRY. >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION. I'M A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND I WANT TO NO WHAT HE STANDS ON EDUCATION IS IN THE ECONOMY. THE LAST 17 YEARS I'VE BEEN TEACHING I HAVE SEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS DECLINE, AND IT IS A CONCERN OFA CONCERN OF MINE AND I AM SURE MANY PEOPLE HERE. >> WHAT DO YOU TEACH? [INAUDIBLE] >> WHAT? FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR TEACHING. II AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING YOUR TEACHERS AND THERE STUDENTS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES THAT KIDS BRING THE SCHOOL THESE DAYS THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED BY A TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM OR THE TEACHER IN THE SPECIALTY PROGRAM LIKE SPECIAL ED. I BELIEVEI BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT WHAT WORKS IN SCHOOL. ANDSCHOOL. AND WHAT WORKS IS RECOGNIZING WHAT OUR JOB THIS IS FOR SO MANY TEACHERS WITH SO MANY KIDS. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A GREAT FRIEND, ONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM SIX. UTAH FOR 35 OR 40 YEARS AND RETIRED A MASTER ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BEGINNING OF YOUR TEACHING CAREER IN THE END OF YOUR TEACHING CAREER? AND SHE TAUGHT IN A SUBURB OF CHICAGO. SHE SAID, A LOT MORE KIDS WITH PROBLEMS CAN BE SCHOOL THAT DID NOT REALLY HAVE ANY SUPPORT AND I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO HELP THEM. NUMBER TWO,. NUMBER TWO, I FELT LIKE EVERY KID THAT I TAUGHT HAD A LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE AND MEMBRANE AND THEY WERE TURNING THE OFF ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE SO USED TO QUICKNESS AND FAST RESPONSES. THE SLOW, HARD, SOMETIMES BORING WORK OF LEARNING SOMETHING WAS JUST HARD FOR THEM TO CONCENTRATE ON AND GRASP. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY. I WANT TO SUPPORT THOSE TRIED-AND-TRUE RESEARCH PROVEN APPROACHES THAT HELPED YOU AS A TEACHER DO THE BEST JOB YOU CAN. HELP YOUR STUDENTS TO SUCCEED TO THE BEST OF THERE ABILITY TO HELP THE SCHOOL YOUR IN TO BE A SUCCESS. AND I HERE THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN SO FOCUSED ON TEST TAKING TO THE EXCLUSION OF NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE AND REALLY BELIEVE -- [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE IN TESTS. THEY SHOULD BE DIAGNOSTIC. A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES. GATHER EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW MANY CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY WERE NOT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF DISABILITY. WE FORGET THOSE DAYS. I KNOCKED ON DOORS SAYING DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL? AND I BLIND CHILDREN DEAF CHILDREN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROMISED IT WOULD PAY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PAID ABOUT 17%. BUT WE HAVE HAVE DONE IS TO SAY WE WANT YOU TO EDUCATE ALL THE CHILDREN THE OTHER THING WE DIDN'T DO IS TO RECOGNIZE IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS SOMETHING I WORKED ON EVER SINCE I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL. ITIT STRUCK WE AS YOU ARE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS, FACTORY WORKERS HAVE TO MAKE SURE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL. GOOD HABITS FOR THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF DISCIPLINE AND LOVE WITH THE GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. 80 PERCENT OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE ADVISORY. HAVE BEEN SINCE SHE WAS A WEEK OLD. SO BILL THE OTHER DAY, ENOUGH WITH THE READING, TALKING, ANSWERING WE DO THIS I CRAZY AND THEN WE HAVE OTHER LITTLE KIDS WHO HAVE A LOT HARDER TIME. THEY MAY NOT HAVE TWO PARENTS IN THE HOME AND MAYBE WORKING LIKE CRAZY. THEY MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES WITH DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR OTHER PROBLEMS. BY THE TIME MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER IS TO KINDERGARTEN,JUST TO KINDERGARTEN, THE RESEARCH SHOWS SHE WE WILL HAVE HEARD 30 MILLION MORE WORDS THAN A CHILDLESS ADVENTIST BACKGROUND. I WANT YOU TO BE THE TEACHER. PUT YOURSELF IN THE TEACHERS POSITION. HERE IS LITTLE CHARLOTTE AND SINCE SHE DOES HAVE SOME CLINTON JAMES A PROBLEM IS SHE'S TALKING TOO MUCH. THINK ABOUTTHINK ABOUT LITTLE CHARLIE HAD JUST AS MUCH POTENTIAL LOST A LINE JUST AS MUCH, BUT AS VOCABULARY IS NOWHERE NEAR WHAT IT COULD BE. WHICH UNDER THE TEACHER AND SAY FROM THE 1st DAY OF KINDERGARTEN YET THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP. YOU GO FIX IT. WE WILL.FINGERS AT YOU IF YOU DON'T. THAT IS NOT RIGHT. THAT IS JUST NOT RIGHT. SO MANY PEOPLE. ZERO MY GOSH. THIS YOUNG MAN BACK AGAINST THE WALL. [INAUDIBLE QUESTION] >> SAY IT AGAIN. >> OKAY. AS WE ALL NO THE KNEW HORIZONS PROBE JUST PAST THAN A THOUSAND MILES UP THE. I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT IS NOT A PLANET. IT'S A POOR PLANET. BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT. I AM WONDERING IF YOU THINK THAT SPACE EXPLORATION CONSIDERING THAT NASA'S FUNDING IS DWINDLING AND HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS, IF IT IS STILL A RELEVANT PURSUE OR IF IT IS AN OBSOLETE LEFTOVERLEFT OVER FROM THE 1950s WORK WE SHOULD LEAVE IT TO CORPORATIONS. I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU THINK. >> YOU'RE TALKINGYOU TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, TEENAGER BY THEN WAS LIKE 14 I THINK. THE SPACE PROGRAM WAS GETTING STARTED AND I WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT OVER TO NASA AND SUPPORT ALL I HAVE TO DO TO BE PREPARED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT AND THEY WERE BACK AND SAID THANK YOU, BUT WE ARE TAKING GIRLS THAT HAS THANKFULLY CHANGED. AND TO BE FAIR I NEVER COULD HAVE QUALIFIED ANYWAY. IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOSING SLEEP OVER, BUTOVER, BUT I REALLY DO SUPPORT THE SPACE PROGRAM. YOU ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTION ONE OF THE GREAT ADVANTAGES WE HAVE HAD LESS 50, 60, 70 YEARS IS HE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS THE INVESTMENT WE HAVE MADE IN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH OF ALL KINDS. AND IT IS A HUGE ECONOMIC BOOM. YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE EARLY '90s OUR COUNTRY INVESTED IN MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME. MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT WHEN IT FINALLY WAS REVEALED MONEY HAD BEEN PUT IN BY BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS AND CONGRESSES BECAUSE WE WANTED TO NO MORE ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANT. IN THE YEARS SINCE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS OF BEEN CREATED AND MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN GENERATED FOR OUR ECONOMY. #ESTIMATE IN THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS. WE HAVE ALSO HAD LOTS OF BUSINESSES SPINOFF FROM NASA RESEARCH. WE HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF THAT RESEARCH GOING IN TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN SO THAT IT CAN BE USED NOT JUST FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH PURPOSES BUT ALSO FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT IS ONE OF AMERICA'S ADVANTAGES. NO ONE IS IS INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE, SMART ABOUT TAKING RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS AND TRANSLATING THEM INTO COMMERCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US CONTINUE TO EXPLORE SPACE. I THINK WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS A BLACKHOLE WHY IT IS THEY ARE, WHAT IS A LACK OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR US. ON THEUS. ON A SECURITY BASIS WE SHOULD BE MAPPING THE METEORITES AND METEORS AND OTHER THINGS. THERE IS JUST A LOT FOR US TO KEEP LEARNING. A THINK IT IS A GOOD INVESTMENT. ON MY LIST OF THINGS THAT I WANT OUR COUNTRY TO INVEST IN IN TERMS OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION INAND SCIENCE, BASIC SCIENCE EXPLORING SPACE FROM OUR OCEANS, OUR GENOME, WE ARE AT THE BRINK OF ALL KINDS OF KNEW INFORMATION. IINFORMATION. I DON'T HAVE AN OBJECTION THE PARTNERING WITH COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES, BUT THEY ARE MORE IN THE APPLIED SCIENCE ARENA, NOT THE DISCOVERY AND RESEARCH ARENA [APPLAUSE] >> GO. >> HELLO. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, LAST TIME YOU WERE IN -- LAST TIME YOU WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE WE HAD A BALANCED-BUDGET. DO YOU THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE AGAIN? >> THANK YOU FOR ASKING. [APPLAUSE] YES, WE DID HAVE A BALANCED-BUDGET AND A SURPLUS IN MY HUSBAND LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. I NOI NO THAT THE DEMOCRATS BUT A LOT OF INDEPENDENTS, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS. I REPUBLICANS. I HOPE YOU ARE HEAR BECAUSE I THINK THE CONVERSATION WE NEED I HOPE GETS BEYOND THE USUAL PARTISANSHIP AND REALLY FLEXIBLE WE CAN DO TOGETHER AS A NATION. WITH RESPECT TO THE BALANCED-BUDGET AND SURPLUS WELABOR ON TRACK AND WE STAYED ON THAT FISCAL COURSE TO PAYING OFF A NATIONAL DEBT, NOT JUST ELIMINATING DEFICIT FOR WHICH IS WHAT ABOUT BUDGET AND SURPLUS MEANS,MEANS, BUT REALLY PAYING DOWN OUR NATIONAL DEBT. I WENT TO THE SENATE FROM JANUARY 2001 AND REMEMBER VERY WELL PRESIDENT BUSH I CAN SUPPORT A MODERATE TAX BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A BALANCED-BUDGET CALL BUT WAS NOT DO IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE LOSE THE ADVANTAGE WE NOW HAVE TO CONTROL OUR OWN FISCAL DESTINY. I LOST THAT ARGUMENT GOING FOR ALTERNATIVE. IN SEPTEMBER 11 HAPPENED. I KNEW IT WAS GOING BECAUSE MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO REBUILD NEW YORK, THEYORK, THE PENTAGON, START DOING WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES. AND THE ADMINISTRATION ASKED FOR ANOTHER BIG TAX CUT. THEN WE HAD TO WORSE COMMAND I THINK IT WAS THE THOUGHT THE ONLY TIME AMONG THE FEW TIMES. SO BY THE COURSE OF THAT EIGHT YEARS WE BASICALLY SAW HUGE EXPENSES GOING IN THE HOMELAND SECURITY, GOING IN THE MILITARY COMMAND WE SAW OUR BALANCED-BUDGET ONCE AGAIN TURN INTO BIG DEFICITS , CERTAINLY KNOW SURPLUS AND THE ECONOMIC CRASH. SO I WOULD HOPE WITH SENSIBLE ECONOMIC POLICY WE COULD GET BACK MOVING TOWARD BALANCE. MY PROBLEMMY PROBLEM IS I FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE MY HUSBAND AND PRESIDENT OBAMA. I AM NOT QUITE SURE HOW WE WILL PLAY ALTOGETHER BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. YOU HAVE TO KEEP EYE ON ABUSES FROM WALL STREET AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO DEFEND DODD FRANK ANOTHER EFFORTS. I WISH WE HAD PAID FOR THOSE WARS AND HAVE ENDED UP IN A BETTER FISCAL POSITION THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE BECAUSE OF THE COLLAPSE AND EVERYTHING THAT PRES. OBAMAPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TRIED TO DO TO DIG US OUT OF THAT WHOLE HAS BEEN IMPORTANT BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR HEAD ABOVE THE RIM WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF IT AND DO WE NEED TO DO. [APPLAUSE] >> THIS MAN HAS BEEN PATIENT AND ANXIOUS. HERE COMES A MICROPHONE. [APPLAUSE] >> GOOD AFTERNOON. HOW DO I ADDRESS YOU? AS YOU CAN TELL IN YIDDISH AND CALLED THE OLD MAN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE ENJOYED FOR BEING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY, AND ONE OF THE WAYS I CAN DO THAT IS BECAUSE I HAVE THIS WONDERFUL THING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. LET'S HERE IT FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] AND SUE REMINDTO REMIND PEOPLE, IT WAS A DEMOCRAT THEY GOT YOU SOCIAL SECURITY. WITH THAT IN MIND I STILLI STILL HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY. THANK YOU. >> YES. THE ANSWER IS YES YOU WILL. WE HAVE TO DEFEND AGAINST THE EFFORTS TO PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY WHICH MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE. YOU ALSO HAVE TO DO MORE TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE MORE SAVINGS THEMSELVES AND HAVE THOSE SAVINGS PRODUCE RESULTS WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE BETTER EFFORTS TO GET THE ADVISORS WHO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THERE INVESTMENTS AND 4 O 1 K NOT TO BE CHURNING AND USE THE MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS. WE NEED A SAVINGS PLAN ON THE ONE SIDE WE HAVE GOT TO DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY PERMITTING THE BASE. YOU DON'T LIKE GOLD OLD TO ME, BUT IN THERE OLDER YEARS. I JUST WANT TO SAY A QUICK WORD. MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE ON SOCIAL SECURITY OR SPOUSES) IS WHO HAS SOME UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF EFFORTS I WAS INVOLVED IN BEING BACK PRESIDENT BUSH'S EFFORTS TO PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER THE WELL-BEING OF OLDER WOMEN, PARTICULARLY SINGLE, WIDOWED, DIVORCED WOMEN ON SOCIAL SECURITY WORK TO MARRY MODEST JOBS WITH LOW WAGES OR WORKED ONLY INTERMITTENTLY, THEY ARE HAVING A HARD TIME OF IT. WE IT. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOCIAL SECURITY, PROTECT AND DEFEND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WE WILL DO THIS FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL. IT IS NOTIT IS NOT DOING AWAY WE TAKE CARE OF IT AND DO WHAT IS NECESSARY. [APPLAUSE] YES. ) A WHITE SHIRT. >> YOU HAVE MANY TITLES. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT. APPMACK HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE AND I WISH YOU THE BEST AND THINK IT WE WILL BE RUNAWAY. MY COMPLAINT IS VERY INANE CALL THAT IT AFFECTS EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM COMMAND I DO NOT NO IF IT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN HELP CANNOT. IFIF THE DO NOT CALL REGISTRY, BUT IF YOU INITIATED THE CALL, AND THIS HAPPENED A MYSELF WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A MARKETPLACE HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION TO LOOK AT REDUCED HEALTH CARE COST, COME TO FIND OUT IT SEEMS IT WAS KIND OF A SCAM COMMAND I AM GETTING UPWARDS OF 20 CALLS A DAY. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING. I TRIED BLOCKING. THE. THE PHONE COMPANY ONLY BOX 12 NUMBERS, SO THAT IS HELPING.

THIS PHONE IS CONSTANTLY BOUNCING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EVEN NEW HAMPSHIRE NUMBERS. WHEN THEY THEY DON'T GET ME AGAINST THE SEATTLE WASHINGTON DC. SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS TELLING ME AND I'M ALWAYS RUNNING FOR THE PHONE BECAUSE I AM WAITING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER TO CONTACT ME. WHAT CAN WE DO?

I DON'T NO THE ANSWER, ANSWER,ANSWER, BUT I WILL TRY TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS AN ANSWER COMMAND I WOULDI WOULD LOVE FOR SOMEBODY ON MY CAMPAIGN TO MEET WITH YOU AND WE WILL FIGURE OUT. I CAN PROMISE YOU BUT TELL YOU THAT I WE WILL LOOK INTO IT, TRY TO FIGURE OUT THERE'S A WAY TO HELP YOU BECAUSE IT IS ANNOYING. I KNOW. I HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AT HOME AND IT IS SO ANNOYING WHEN YOU TOLD SOMEONE ARE NOT INTERESTED, PLEASE DON'T CALL ME AND THEY GO TO THE CYCLING CALL YOU AGAIN AND CALL YOU AGAIN ON ESTIMATE. I WILL TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT WE CAN DO HELP YOU. YES, SIR. >> HERE COMES THE LIKE. >> CONGRATULATIONS ON A GRANDPARENT THING. >> ISN'T IT THE BEST. >> YEAH. >> YOU ARE THE ONLY CANDIDATE WITH INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE. [APPLAUSE] I WAS TELLING MY 95 -YEAR-OLD MOTHER-IN-LAW THAT I THINK THE SECRETARY OF STATE JOB IS THE MOST AMENDMENT THING. ARE WE GOING TO REGRET CONTINUES FROM NOW WILL CHARLOTTE REGRET THE FACT THAT THE IRANIANS WILL NOW BEGIN THE MOVE AS FAST AS THEY WANT AND TEN YEARS TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITHIN FIVE YEARS SELLING ARMS TO ALL THE BAD GUYS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. >> IT IS A FAIR QUESTION COMMAND IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING I HOPE PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW. THE CONSEQUENCES, THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES ARE ONES THAT WE ALL HAVE TO ADDRESS. LET ME TELL YOU HOW I LOOK AT IT. AND I WILL JUST GO BACK A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. THE IRANIANS MASTER THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH WAS PRESIDENT THEY BUILT TO COVERT FACILITIES THAT WE NO WHEN THEY BEGAN THE STOCK THEM WITH CENTRIFUGES THAT WERE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED DESPITE THE WORLD AND OUR BEST EFFORTS TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT. THE EFFORTS THAT WE BEGAN WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME TO OFFICE AND I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE WERE DIRECTED AT TRYING TO FORCE THEM INTO A NEGOTIATION TO DO IS MUCHAS MUCH AS WE COULD TO PUT THE LID ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. I SPENT THE 1st 18 MONTHS OF MY TIME IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S JOB WORKING TO PUT TOGETHER THE COALITION OF PASSEDPAST THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION THAT OPPOSED THE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS AND THEN ENFORCE. THEY'RE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T SHARE OUR CONCERNS , ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. ALL THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IS ENERGY. WE HAD TO CONVINCE THEM THAT IT WAS THEIR WORRY BECAUSE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO SOME DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATION MIGHT VERY WELL BEFORE WHICH WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE REGION FOR ENERGY SUPPLIES, AND ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD FLOW FROM THE. WE REALLY DID PUT IN PLACE A TOUGH REGIME OF SANCTIONS COMMAND AND AFTER THE URANIAN ELECTIONS WHEN I MAY HAVE FINALLY GOT ALL YOUR SUPPORT STARTING WITH THE TRIP THAT I MADEI MADE TO OMAN WE WILL BE EXPLORED WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE WOULD BE A SERIOUS EFFORT TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. THE AGREEMENT, THEAGREEMENT, THE INTERIM AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED IS CALLED THE LAUSANNE AGREEMENT. GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS A POSITIVE STEP AND THEN THE FINAL AGREEMENT WHICH IS OVER 100 PAGES, WASA HUNDRED PAGES, WAS LOTS OF ANNEXES. THINK IT'S ON THE INTERNET AND BASICALLY DOES PUT A LID FOR A TIME ON THE URANIUM PROGRAM. THERE ARETHEY'RE ARE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS FOR MY RESPECT WHO HAVE SAID VERY CLEARLY THEY CANNOT SUPPORT IT. I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE. THEY BELIEVE THE IRANIANS WILL CHEAT ON THE AGREEMENT AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T SHOOT WITH CERTAIN OF THE PROVISIONS SUNSET THEY WE WILL HAVE A FREE HAND. I THINK THAT IS A RESPECTABLE ARGUMENT. HOWEVER, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ASK WHAT ALTERNATIVES ARE. WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN NOT JUST WHAT ARE ALTERNATIVES TODAY, TOMORROW,OUR ALTERNATIVES TODAY, TOMORROW, AND 20 YEARS NOW. WHAT ARE OUR ALTERNATIVES RIGHT NOW THEY COULD'VE GOTTEN THE LID FROM ANY OTHER WAY. DO I TRUST THE IRRADIANCE? ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS IS NOT RONALD REAGAN WHO MADE ARMS-CONTROL AGREEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET UNION WHICH WERE VERY IMPORTANT AND WAS CRITICIZED THE EARLY THAT PEOPLE IN HIS OWN PARTY. HE FAMOUSLY SAID TRUST BUT VERIFY. HERE I SAY DON'T TRUST AND VERIFY. WE WE WILL HAVE VERY INTRUSIVE INSPECTIONS. WE WE WILL HAVE MONITORING EQUIPMENT THAT IS HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED THAT EVEN WITHOUT INSPECTIONS WE WILL BE ABLE TO ALERT US TO CHEATING. WE WE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT THE IRRADIANCE TO THE TEST ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING IF WE THINK THEY HAVE CHEATED WITHOUT HAVING TO GET RUSSIA AND CHINA ON BOARD WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT IN THIS AGREEMENT. THE SEC. OF ENERGY, SEC., SECRETARY MONIES, IS A VERY RESPECTED NUCLEAR SCIENTIST HAS CERTAINLY TOLD MANY OF US THAT THIS IS THE VERY BEST INSPECTION AGREEMENT AND INTRUSIVE MONITORING THAT WE COULD HAVE PUT INTO PLACE. .. >> >> AND THE LACK OF TRUSTWORTHINESS IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE AT LEAST WE WILL HAVE HAD A CHANCE I HAVE ADVOCATED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS TO BE MUCH MORE FORCEFUL TO PUT TOGETHER THE UMBRELLA OF SECURITY AROUND THE REGION INCLUDING ISRAEL AND ARAB ALLIES SO IT IS VERY CLEAR TO IRAN IF THEY CHEAT OR BREAK OUT THEY WILL PAY A VERY SERIOUS PRICE. LIKE ANY DIPLOMATIC AGREEMENT IT HAS ITS PLUSES AND ITS DRAWBACKS BUT ON BALANCE I THINK IT IS OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST AT THIS TIME. [APPLAUSE] THEY GIVE FOR TAKING MY QUESTION AND I WILL BE HONEST WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THE ANSWER THEY GAVE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE YOU SAID THIS ELECTION WILL BE A DECIDING ELECTION FOR THE CENTURY IN THE FAKE CLIMATE CHANGES AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT SO IS TO ANSWER YOUR ABILITY TO TAKE LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE CHANGE DUE TO NEW THE FACT YOU HAVE ALSO FUELLED CONTRIBUTIONS TO YOUR CAMPAIGN? >> NO. I KNOW THE RIGHT CANCER TO GET THE VOTES WOULD HAVE BEEN. YOU BET I WILL PAY AN EXTRACTION ON PUBLIC LAND. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? I WILL ADVOCATE. HOW DO YOU GET IT DONE? I WILL KEEP ADVOCATING FOR IT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR ENERGY POLICY. I HAVE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT REPEATEDLY. IT TO DO IN THE WAY IT DOES NOT DISRUPT OUR ECONOMY. IT IS EASY TO SAY TO BE IN THE FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION FOR THOSE TO RELY ON ENERGY SO I AM A STRONG BELIEVER TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE STRONGEST WAY WE CAN TO HAVE THAT TRANSITION IN BETWEEN RENEWABLE ENERGY SOLAR AND WIND AND ADVANCED BIOFUEL. I HAVE TO SAY I'M SORRY THE SPECIFIC CANCER, WAIT JUST A MINUTE. [INAUDIBLE] THAT IS OKAY I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CLIMATE. I HAVE SAID IN THIS CAMPAIGN I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE MAY LIKE END SOME MAY NOT. AND I BELIEVE STRONGLY. [APPLAUSE] I TOTALLY RESPECT THE PASSION AND URGENCY I UNDERSTAND IT AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO HAVE THE ENERGY AND AGENDA THAT WILL CREATE THE MILLIONS OF JOBS THAT I'VE THE KANG, FRANKLY RENEWABLE ENERGY. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL ISSUE THERE ARE CANDIDATES WHO WILL TELL YOU WHAT EVERYONE TO HEAR I WILL TELL YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS IT IN THINGS WE NEED TO DO WE ARE BACKSLIDING. TO WATCH OUT FOR THE UTILITY'S YOU WANT TO STOP THE RENEWABLE ENERGY TO ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO SELL BACK TO THE GRID BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BRING BACK THE TRANSITION AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN. [APPLAUSE] I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE PUBLICLY AND ON THE LIST OF THINGS TO ADDRESS. NO DOUBT. MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO ABSENT A CONGRESS THAT WILL SUPPORT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THEREFORE. [APPLAUSE] THEREFORE IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE WE ELECT PEOPLE WHO CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AS YOU DO HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO RUN FOR OFFICE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DEBATE AND IT IS IMPERATIVE WE SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S EFFORT COURAGEOUS EFFORT WITH EXECUTIVE ACTION BECAUSE HE MOVES FORWARD DESPITE CONGRESSIONAL OPPOSITION. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE A LOT TO DO. >> GO AHEAD. >>. >> I SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. I BELIEVE IT IS NOT ONLY THE SMART PATH TO TAKE BUT ECONOMICALLY SMART IT COULD HELP US GET THE LABOR MARKET WORKING FOR EVERYBODY AGAIN. I TAKE A LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS FOR THOSE OF AMERICAN CITIZENS. HERE IS WHY IT HAD BEEN. IN THE END OF THE LAVENDER 12 MILLION AND PLAYERS CAN EXPLOIT YOU, PAY LESS THAN ANY MINIMUM THEY DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS ONE OF THE POSITIVE RESULTS IS TO REMOVE THE INCENTIVE BECAUSE IT WOULD APPLY TO EVERYBODY. I DON'T BELIEVE WE WILL SUPPORT 12 MILLION PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING HERE. IF SOMEBODY SAYS THEY WANT TO DO THAT I THINK THEY SAY SOMETHING WILL NEVER HAPPEN. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB TO SECURE OUR BORDERS. NOT JUST THE SOUTHERN BUT AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IF WE MOVE TO THE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP THE COUNTRY WILL TAKE A DEEP BREATH TO SAY HOW DO WE LIVE WITH ALL OF THAT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND WE HAVE THE RIGHT APPROACH ECONOMICALLY. REMEMBER AND 2010 THERE WAS A SENATE COMPROMISE BILL WITH A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION PLAN BY BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS THAT WAS A LOST OPPORTUNITY BUT THAT BILL STILL REMAINS A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATES THE WAS WONDERING IF I COULD BRING THAT TO A DIFFERENT ISSUE. YOU MENTIONED YOU WOULD SUPPORT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF SO DO THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD HAPPEN DURING YOUR PRESIDENCY OR DO YOU HAVE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES? >> GREAT QUESTION. I THINK WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN LEGISLATIVELY OR REGULATORY AND THERE IS THE DEBATES. SOME EXPERTS SAY THINGS THAT CONGRESS COULD DO IF YOU PUT THE PRESSURE ON THEM TO GET THEM DONE BECAUSE IF WE STILL HAVE A LOPSIDED MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AT LEAST IT IS A PATH FORWARD. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION TO MAKE THAT A OF VOTING ISSUE THAT IN EVERY TOWN HALL EVERY MEETING IT EVERY DISTRICT ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCUMBENTS AND CHALLENGERS WOULD BE ASKED FOR:SO THAT MAY BE A GREAT ORGANIZING TOOL. SO THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO IF NECESSARY. >> I AM LISTENING TO ALL THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE HAVE. WHAT I REALIZE WHAT IF YOU HAVE A LOPSIDED CONGRESS? WHAT AGE YOUR PLAN? >> I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY BECAUSE I HOPE IT ISN'T AS LOPSIDED. I REALLY DO. THERE IS A LOT OF STATES THAT ARE FAR AHEAD OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IOWA GETS 25 PERCENT OF ITS ENERGY RIGHT NOW FROM WHEN AND. SO DOES TEXAS. IS NOT LIKE NOTHING IS HAPPENING BUT AT A FEDERAL LEVEL IS NOT ENOUGH IS HAPPENING THE MORE WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THE STATE'S AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DO MUCH LOWER WHEN THE BETTER OFF WE WILL BE EVEN IF WE CAN GET THE BIG SOLUTION WITH THE CREDIT WITH THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WITH THE EXPANSION OF WIND AND SOLAR AND BIOFUELS. DON'T FORGET ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THE EASIEST PATH FOR WORD IN AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO BESIDES WEIGHT FOR CONGRESS. >> I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION RIGHT NOW. BUT WITH A LOPSIDED CONGRESS. >> YOU TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING >> JUST LIKE WHEN I SERVED IN THE SENATE I WAS IN THE MAJORITY AND THE MINORITY. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS AND TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS ONE STEP AT A TIME I WILL GO ANYWHERE OR ANYTIME AND I DID THAT IN THE SENATE I SPONSORED THE LEGISLATION I WORKED THE PATH WITH PEOPLE WHOM I HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON BUT I FOUND THAT LINK IT WILL BE FUN IN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY PRAISE HIS SECRETARY OF STATE BUT I WILL LET YOU HEAR ALL OF THAT AS THE CAMPAIGN GOES FOR WORD. THEY WILL TRY TO FORGET THAT THEY SAID THAT. I KNOW HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND HOW TO STAND MY GROUND. [APPLAUSE] >> IF HE HAS A SUIT AND TIE DESERVES TO ASK A QUESTION. >> WE MENTIONED REWARDING CITIZENS FOR PUBLIC SERVICE I AM AN ALUMNI OF AMERICORPS AND WE NEED TO INVEST A NATIONAL SERVICE I AM GRATEFUL FOR MY OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH MY PURSE MY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ALLOW ME TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY COMMUNITY TO HALT THE COMPLETE MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE. IF ELECTED PRESIDENT WOULD DO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS TO ALLOW CITIZENS TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY? >> YES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. ABSOLUTELY I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE I AM PLEASED TO TICKET VANTAGE OF THE FINANCIAL AID TO GET YOUR UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION. WE NEED MORE NATIONAL SERVICE AS THE LINK FOR TRAINING FOR OTHER ADVANCED EDUCATION. YES I WILL DEFINITELY PUSH THE SUPPORT BUT IT IS QUITE A TRIBUTE TO BUT IT HAS SURVIVED BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS A PATRIOTIC THING TO DO TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY SO YES I SUPPORT THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> LET ME SAY ONE THING. WITH THIS NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT HER BUT IT IS ABOUT US YOU HAVE DONE ONE HECK OF A JOB. LET'S TAKE ONE MORE QUESTION >> APHAKIA MADAM SECRETARY REPRESENT OUR STATE LEGISLATURE REVOKED TO WELCOME YOU THERE VERY SOON. JURY THE SEQUESTER REMASTER PROGRAM -- WE LOST A PROGRAM WITH THE CHILDREN WHO ARE EARLY-WARNING EARLY-WARNING, HEADSTART. YES. 18 CHILDREN WERE GOING BUT THEN IT WAS ENDED WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THAT? >> THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT IT MEANS A LOT AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL YOU ASK ME ABOUT EARLY AGE AND OF THE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE IT ALL BEGINS. TO HAVE A A GOOD EXPERIENCE TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL. I SUPPORT HEAD START AND I HOPE TO START EARLY HEADSTART TO GET THEM AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENTS TO BE BETTER PREPARED. I INTEND TO ADVOCATE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL COMMUNITY TO. BECAUSE NOT EVERY LOCAL COMMUNITY WANTS TO DO WITH THE SAME AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF ELIGIBLE. I WANT TO MAKE THAT A HIGH PRIORITY. [APPLAUSE] >> YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL ON YOUR JOB",2015-11-07 17:50:01,2015-07-16,Dover,New Hampshire
http://www.c-span.org/video/?327052-1/hillary-clinton-economic-policy-address,Hillary Clinton Economic Policy Address,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO THE NEW SCHOOL. I AM THE PRESIDENT HERE AT THE NEW SCHOOL. THE NEW SCHOOL IS A UNIVERSITY, CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO. IT IS A UNIQUE-DESIGN INSPIRED UNIVERSITY. TAKING COURAGEOUS ACTIONS TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. THIS AUDITORIUM HAS A RICH TRADITION OF BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER, TO EXCHANGE VIEWS. IT IS ALSO A PLACE OF TOLERANCE. THESE ARE VERY CRITICAL DAYS FOR OUR COUNTRY. NOW MORE THAN EVER, THE WORLD NEEDS INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND NEW WAYS OF THINKING. WE DO WELCOME OPPORTUNITIES -- [APPLAUSE] WE DO WELCOME OPPORTUNITIES TO HEAR PROPOSALS FROM OUR GREAT POLITICAL LEADERS. IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO WELCOME HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. MRS. CLINTON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANKS TO EVERYONE AT THE NEW SCHOOL FOR WELCOMING US TODAY. I I AM DELIGHTED TO BE BACK. I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO AMERICANS CONCERNED ABOUT AN THE ECONOMY THAT STILL IS NOT DELIVERING FOR THEM, NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD. IT STILL SEEMS TO MOST AMERICANS THAT IT IS STACKED FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE HOPES THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOR THEIR FUTURES, STARTING SMALL BUSINESS THEY HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT, GETTING A JOB THAT PAYS WELL ENOUGH TO SIT OR A FAMILY AND PROVIDE FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT. PREVIOUS GENERATIONS BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY AND STRONGEST MIDDLE-CLASS THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN ON THE PROMISE OF A BASIC BARGAIN -- IF YOU WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD. WHEN YOU GET AHEAD, AMERICA GETS AHEAD. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, THAT BARGAIN HAS ERODED. OUR JOB IS TO ME IT STRONG AGAIN. FOR 35 YEARS, REPUBLICANS HAVE ARGUED THAT IF WE GIVE MORE WEALTH TO THOSE AT THE TOP, BY CUTTING THEIR TAXES, IT WILL TRICKLE DOWN TO EVERYONE ELSE. EVERY TIME THEY HAD A CHANCE TO TRY THAT APPROACH, IT EXPLODES THE NATIONAL DEBT, CONCENTRATES WEALTH EVEN MORE, AND IS PRACTICALLY NOTHING TO HELP HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. TWICE NOW IN THE PAST 20 YEARS A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT HAS HAD TO COM EINE IN AND CLEAN UP THE MESS LEFT BEHIND. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: I THINK THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA -- CLINTON -- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT --AMERICA SAW THE LARGEST PEACETIME EXPANSION IN OUR HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: NEARLY 23 MILLION JOBS, A BALANCED BUDGET, AND A SURPLUS FOR THE FUTURE. INCOMES ROSE ACROSS THE BOARD NOT JUST FOR THOSE ALREADY AT THE TOP. EIGT YEARS LATER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE' HARD WORDK HOLD US BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DEPRESSION. PRESIDENT OBAMA SEE THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO TEEN MILLION AMERICANS -- TO 16 MILLION AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: NOW, TODAY IS THE SHADOW OF-- AS THE SHADOW OF CRISES RECEDE, I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD A GROWTH AND FAIRNESS ECONOMY. YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. WE CANNOT CREATE ENOUGH JOBS WITHOUT MORE GROWTH. AND WE CANNOT WILL STRONG FAMILIES AND SUPPORT OUR CONSUMER ECONOMY WITHOUT MORE FAIRNESS. WE NEED BOTH. AMERICA STANDING AGAIN, WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY WE SHOULD. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE NEAR RECORD HIGHS. AMERICANS ARE WORKING AS HARD AS EVER. BUT PAYCHECKS HAD NEARLY BUDGED IN REAL TERMS. FAMILIES TODAY ARE STRETCHED IN SO MANY DIRECTIONS, AND SO ARE THERE BUDGETS. HEALTH CARE, CHILDCARE, HEARING FOR AGING PARENTS ARE RISING A LOT FASTER THAN WAGES. I HERE THIS EVERYWHERE I GO. A SINGLE MOM TALKED ABOUT JUGGLING A JOB IN CLASS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHILE RAISING THREE KIDS. SHE DOESN'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO COME EASY. IF SHE GOT A RAISE, EVERYTHING WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO HARD. THE GRANDMOTHER WHO WORKS AROUND THE CLOCK PROVIDING CHILDCARE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS. THE PAY IS FAIRLY ENOUGH TO LIVE ON, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SOARING PRICE OF HER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR OF DREAM OF BUYING THE LOCAL BOWLING ALLEY WAS NEARLY DERAILED BY STUDENT DEBT. IF HE CAN GROW HIS BUSINESS, HE CAN PAY OFF HIS DEBT AND HIS EMPLOYEES MORE, TOO. WAGES NEED TO RISE TO KEEP UP WITH COST. PAYCHECKS NEED TO GROW. FAMILIES WHO WORK HARD AND DO THEIR PART DESERVE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. OF THE DEFINING ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME CLEAR. WE MUST RAISE INCOMES FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS SO THEY CAN AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS L IFEIFE. WE MUST DRIVE STEADY INCOME GROWTH THAT LIFTS UP FAMILIES, AND THAT -- [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: AND THAT WILL BE MY MISSION, FROM THE FIRST DAY I AM PRESIDENT TO THE LAST. I -- [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: I WILL GET UP EVERY DAY THINKING ABOUT THE FAMILIES OF AMERICA, LIKE THE FAMILY I CAME FROM, A HARD-WORKING DAD STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS AND GAVE US A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT IN NEW YORK AND THE STORIES THEY TOLD ME AND THAT I WILL TAKE ON THIS CHALLENGE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF MAJOR CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMY THAT DID NOT START WITH THE RECESSION AND WILL NOT END WITH THE RECOVERY. ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED NEW AREAS OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND OPENED NEW MARKETS FOR EXPORTS. TOO OFTEN THEY ARE POLARIZING OUR ECONOMY, BENEFITING HIGH SKILLED WORKERS BUT DOWNGRADING BLUE-COLLAR JOBS AND OTHER MID-LEVEL JOBS THAT USED TO PROVIDE SOLID INCOME FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. TODAY'S MARKETPLACE FOCUSES TOO MUCH ON THE SHORT-TERM, LIKE SECOND TO SECOND FINANCIAL TRADING, AND TOO LITTLE ON LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. MANY AMERICANS ARE MAKING EXTRA MONEY RENTING OUT A SMALL ROOM, SELLING PRODUCTS THEY DESIGN THEMSELVES AT HOME OR DRIVING THEIR OWN CAR. THIS SO-CALLED GIG ECONOMY IS CREATING EXCITING ECONOMIES AND UNLEASHING INNOVATION. IT IS ALSO RAISING HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT A GOOD JOB WILL LOOK LIKE TEACHER. ALL OF THESE TRENDS ARE REAL AND NONE IS GOING AWAY. BUT THEY DO NOT DETERMINE OUR DESTINY. THE CHOICES WE MAKE AS A NATION MATTER. AND THE CHOICES WE MAKE WILL SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT AMERICAN LIFE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS IN OUR ECONOMY WILL BE LIKE IN THIS CENTURY. AS PRESIDENT I WILL WORK WITH EVERY POSSIBLE PARTNER TO TURN THE TIDE TO MAKE THESE CURRENTS OF CHANGE WORKING FOR US, TO STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. I THINK AT OUR BEST THAT IS WHAT AMERICANS DO. WE ARE PROBLEM SOLVERS. WE DO NOT HIDE FROM CHANGE. THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS MUST BE HOW MUCH INCOMES RISE FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES, NOT JUST FOR SUCCESSFUL CEO'S AND MONEY MANAGERS AND NOT SOME ARBITRARY GROWTH TARGETS UNCOVERED TWO PEOPLE -- UNTETHERED TO PEOPLE'S LIVES LIVELIHOODS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: I WANT TO SEE OUR ECONOMY WORK FOR THE STRUGGLING, THE STRIVING, AND THE SUCCESSFUL. WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIND ALL THE ANSWERS WE NEED TODAY IN THE PLAYBOOKS OF THE PAST. WE CANNOT GO BACK TO THE OLD POLICIES THAT FAILED US BEFORE, NOR CAN WE JUST REPLAY THE SUCCESSES. TODAY IS NOT 1993 OR 2009. SO WE NEED SOLUTIONS FOR THE BIG CHALLENGES WE FACE NOW. I AM PROPOSING AN AGENDA TO RAISE INCOMES, FOR STRONG GROWTH, THEIR GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. MORE GROWTH MEANS MORE JOBS AND MORE NEW BUSINESSES. MORE JOBS GET PEOPLE CHOICES ABOUT WHERE TO WORK. EMPLOYERS HAVE TO OFFER BETTER THAN IF IT'S TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER TO HIGHER NEW WORKERS -- TO HIRE NEW WORKERS. GETTING CLOSER TO FULL EMPLOYMENT IS CRUCIAL FOR RAISING INCOMES. SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE MORE THAN 60% OF NEW AMERICAN JOBS. AND A HALF TO BE A TOP PRIORITY. I WANT TO BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT, AND I MEAN IT. I I'M GOING TO BE TALKING HOW WE EMPOWER ENTREPRENEURS EASIER ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND SIMPLIFICATION. I WILL PUSH OR BROADER BUSINESS TAX REFORM TO SPUR INVESTMENT IN AMERICA, CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES THAT REWARD COMPANIES TOTHAT SEND JOBS AND PROFITS OVERSEAS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: AND I KNOW IT IS NOT ALWAYS HOW WE THINK ABOUT THIS. ANOTHER ENGINE OF STRONG GROWTH SHOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] MRS. CLINTON: I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS. BRINGING MILLIONS OF HARD-WORKING PEOPLE INTO THE FORMAL ECONOMY WOULD INCREASE OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY AN ESTIMATED 700 EARLY IN DOLLARS OVER -- $700 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THEN THERE ARE THE -- WHEN WE GET AMERICANS MOVING WE GET OUR COUNTRY MOVING. LET'S ESTABLISHED AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT CAN CHANNEL MORE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: CHANNEL THOSE FUNDS TO FINANCE WORLD-CLASS AIRPORTS, RAILWAYS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES, AND PORTS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: AND LET'S BUILT THOSE FASTER BROADBAND NETWORKS AND MAKE SURE THERE IS A GREATER DIVERSITY OF PROVIDERS SO CONSUMERS HAVE MORE CHOICE. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: AND THERE IS NO EXCUSE NOT TO ME GREATER INVESTMENTS IN CLEANER RENEWABLE ENERGY RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: OUR ECONOMY RUNS ON ENERGY AND THE TIME HAS COME TO MAKE AMERICA THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, SAVE US MONEY IN THE LONG RUN, AND HELP US MEET THE THREATS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. LET'S FUND THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT SPAWNED INNOVATIVE COMPANIES AND CREATES ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRIES, JUST AS THE PROJECT TO SEQUENCE THE HUMAN GENOME DID IN THE 1990'S AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S INITIATIVES ON PRECISION MEDICINE WILL DO IN THE COMING YEARS. I WILL SET AMBITIOUS GOALS IN ALL OF THESE AREAS IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. LET ME EMPHASIZE ANOTHER KEY INGREDIENT OF STRONG GROWTH THAT OFTEN GOES OVERLOOKED. BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS SO MORE AMERICANS PARTICIPATE MORE FULLY IN THE WORKFORCE, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] MRS. CLINTON: WE ARE IN A GLOBAL COMPETITION, AS I AM SURE YOU HAVE NOTICED. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LEAVE TALENT ON THE SIDELINE. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY. WHEN WE LEAVE PEOPLE OUT, WE SHORTCHANGE THEN AND WE SHORTCHANGE OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE. THE MOVEMENT OF WOMEN INTO THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN $3.5 TRILLION IN ECONOMIC GROWTH. BUT THAT PROGRESS HAS STALLED. THE UNITED STATES USED TO RANK SEVEN OUT OF 24 ADVANCED COUNTRIES IN WOMEN'S LABOR FORCE OR DISSIPATION. BY 2013, WE HAD DROPPED TO 19. THAT REPRESENTS A LOT OF UNUSED POTENTIAL FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. STUDIES SHOW NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THIS DECLINE RELATIVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPANDING FAMILY-FRIENDLY POLICIES LIKE A LEAVE, AND WE ARE NOT. WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT EASIER FOR AMERICANS TO BE GOOD WORKERS AND CAREGIVERS. WOMEN WHO WANT TO WORK SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF A FAMILY MEMBER GETS SICK. LAST YEAR -- [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: LAST YEAR WHILE I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL IN MANHATTAN WAITING FOR CHARLOTTE TO MAKE A GRAND, ENTRANCE ONE OF THE NURSES SAID THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR PAID LEAVE. SHE SEES FIRSTHAND WHAT IT MEANS FOR HERSELF AND HER COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS FOR THE WORKING PARENTS THAT SHE HELPS TAKE CARE OF. IT IS TIME TO RECOGNIZE THAT QUALITY CHILDCARE IS NOT A LUXURY. IT IS A GROWTH STRATEGY. IT IS PAST TIME TO END THE OUTRAGE OF SO MANY WOMEN EARNING LESS THAN MEN ON THE JOB, AND WOMEN OF COLOR MAKING EVEN LESS. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] MRS. CLINTON: ALL THIS LOST MONEY AND IT'S UP -- ADDS UP, FOR SOME WOMEN IT IS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. FOR FAR TOO LONG, THESE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN DISMISSED BY SOME AS WOMEN'S ISSUES. WELL, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. [APPLAUSE] >> WHOO! MRS. CLINTON: FAIR PAY AND FAIR SCHEDULING AND EARNED SICK DAYS, CHILDCARE ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND OUR GROWTH. AND WE CAN DO THIS IN WAY THAT DOES NOT IMPOSE UNFAIR BURDENS ON BUSINESSES. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL FIND TO PUT FAMILIES FIRST, JUST LIKE I HAVE MY ENTIRE CAREER. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: BEYOND STRONG GROWTH, WE NEED FAIR GROWTH, AND THAT WILL BE THE SECOND KEY DRIVER OF RAISING INCOMES. THE EVIDENCE IS IN. INEQUALITY IS A DRAG ON OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY. SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM WE NEED TO TACKLE. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD GOVERNOR BUSH SAY AMERICANS JUST NEED TO WORK LONGER HOURS. WELL, HE MUST NOT HAVE MET VERY MANY AMERICAN WORKERS. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: LET HIM TELL THAT TO THE NURSE WHO STANDS ON HER FEET ALL DAY WITH THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM OR THE TRUCKER WHO DRIVES ALL NIGHT, TO THE FAST WORKER MARCHING INDUSTRY FOR BETTER PAY. THEY DO NOT NEED A LECTURE. THEY NEED A RAISE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] MRS. CLINTON: THE TRUTH IS THE CURRENT RULES FOR OUR ECONOMY DO REWARD SOME WORK, LIKE FINANCIAL TRADING, MUCH MORE THAN OTHER WORK, LIKE ACTUALLY BUILDING AND SELLING THINGS, THE WORK THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY. TO GET ALL INCOMES RISING WE NEED TO STRIKE A BETTER BALANCE. IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU SHOULD BE A FAIRLY. WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW RULES ON OVERTIME AND THEN GO FURTHER. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: I WILL CRACK DOWN ON BOSSES WHO EXPLOIT EMPLOYEES BY MS. CLASSIFYING THEM AS CONTRACTORS OR EVEN STEEL THEIR WAGES -- STEAL THEI WAGESR. WE NEED TO TAKE ON THE MAJOR STRAIN ON FAMILY BUDGETS. I WILL PROTECT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND BUILD ON IT TO LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET HEALTH CARE COSTS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: AND TO THEY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- AND TO MAY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MORE AFFORDABLE WILL HELP FAMILIES FORWARD TO RETIREMENT BY DEFENDING AND ENHANCING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MAKING IT EASIER TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE. MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE TIME-TESTED AND MORE THAN A LITTLE BATTLE SCARRED. WE NEED NEW IDEAS, AS WELL, AND ONE I WILL FIGHT FOR HIS PROFIT-SHARING. HARD-WORKING AMERICANS DESERVE TO BENEFIT FROM THE RECORD CORPORATE EARNINGS THEY HELP PRODUCE. I WILL PRODUCE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES. THAT IS GOOD FOR WORKERS AND BUSINESSES. PROFIT SHARING GIVES EVERYONE A STAKE IN THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS CAN BOOST PRODUCTIVITY AND PUT MONEY DIRECTLY INTO EMPLOYEES' POICKETS. I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS. ANOTHER PRIORITY MUST BE REFORMING OUR TAX CODE. WE HEAR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM. BUT TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THEIR PLANS. SENATOR RUBIO'S WOULD CUT TAXES FOR HOUSEHOLD MAKING AROUND $3 MILLION A YEAR BY ALMOST $240,000, WHICH IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE EARNINGS OF A TYPICAL FAMILY. THAT IS A SURE BUDGET BUSTING GIVEAWAY TO THE SUPER WEALTHY AND THE KIND OF BAD ECONOMICS YOU ARE LIKELY TO HEAR FROM ANY OF THE CANDIDATES ON THE OTHER SIDE. I HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE. [LAUGHTER] MRS. CLINTON: GUIDED LICENSE PRINCIPLES. HARD-WORKING FAMILIES NEED AND DESERVE TAX RELIEF AND SIMPLIFICATION. THOSE AT THE TOP HAVE TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. I SUPPORT THE BUFFET RULE, WHICH MAKE SURE MILLIONAIRES DO NOT PAY LOWER RATES THAN THEIR SECRETARIES. I HAVE CALLED FOR CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE THAT LETS WEALTHY FINANCIERS PAY AN ARTIFICIALLY LOW RATE. HUGELY SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES THAT BENEFIT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, ESPECIALLY WHILE COMPANIES CANNOT AFFORD HIGH-PRICED LAWYERS END UP PAYING MORE. ALONGSIDE TAX REFORM IT IS TIME TO STAND UP TO EFFORTS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY TO UNDERMINE WORKER BARGAINING POWER. THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN AGAIN AND AGAIN TO DRIVE UP WAGES. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS LIKE SCOTT WALKER HAVE MADE THEIR NAMES STOMPING ON WORKERS RIGHTS AND PRACTICALLY ALL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WOULD DO THE SAME AS PRESIDENT. I WILL FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE MEAN-SPIRITED MISGUIDED ATTACKS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE DECLINE OF UNIONS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A THIRD OF THE INCREASE OF ANY QUALITY AMONG MEN -- INEQUALITY AMONG MEN. WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT SUPPORTING UNION WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: LET ME JUST SAY A WORD ABOUT TRADE. THE GREEK CRISIS AS WELL AS THE CHINESE STOCK MARKET HAVE REMINDED US THAT GROWTH HERE AT HOME AND GROWTH AND OCEAN AWAY ARE LINKED IN A COMMON GLOBAL ECONOMY. TRADE HAS BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE ECONOMY OVER RECENT DECADES, BUT IT HAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HOLLOWING OUT OUR MANUFACTURING BASE AND MANY HARD-WORKING COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO SET A HIGH BAR FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS. WE SHOULD SUPPORT THEM IF THEY CREATE JOBS, RAISE WAGES, AND INCREASE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO WALK AWAY IF THEY DON'T. TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE AMERICANS. I LOVE THE SAYING BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WHO IN MANY WAYS WAS NOT ONLY THE PRESIDENT WHO SAVED OUR UNION, BUT THE PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTOOD PROFOUNDLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT PLAYING ITS ROLE IN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY. HE TALKED ABOUT GIVING AMERICANS A FAIR CHANCE IN THE RACE OF LIFE. I BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL MY HEART, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IT HAS TO START REALLY EARLY, AT BIRTH. HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS, CAN SET CHILDREN ON THE COURSE FOR FUTURE SUCCESS AND RAISE LIFETIME INCOMES BY 25%. I AM COMMITTED TO SEEING EVERY FOUR-YEAR-OLD IN AMERICA HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS. I WANT TO DO MORE. I WANT TO CALL FOR A GREAT OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FROM OUR FAITH, BUSINESS, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, CIVIC GROUPS, AND CONCERNED CITIZENS, TO REALLY HELP PARENTS, PARTICULARLY PARENTS FACING A LOT OF OBSTACLES. TO REALLY HELP THEM PREPARE THEIR OWN CHILDREN IN THE ZERO TO FOUR AGE GROUP. 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. THAT IS WHY FAMILIES LIKE MINE READ, TALK, AND SAYING ENDLESSLY TO OUR GRANDDAUGHTER. WE HOPE HER FIRST WORDS WILL BE ENOUGH WITH IT TALKING AND SINGING. BUT WE DO IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE LOVE DOING IT EVEN KNOW I WILL ADMIT IT IS EMBARRASSING READING A BOOK TO A TWO OR SIX-WEEK-OLD, BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT IS BUILDING HER CAPACITY FOR LEARNING. RESEARCH SHOWS BY THE TIME SHE ENTERS KINDERGARTEN, SHE WILL HAVE HEARD 30 MILLION MORE WORDS THAN A MILE -- A CHILD FROM A LESS ADVANTAGED BACKGROUND. THINK OF WHAT WE ARE LOSING BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REACH OUT TO THOSE FAMILIES AND WE KNOW AGAIN FROM SO MUCH RESEARCH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD THAT MENTORING AND INTERVENTION WILL HELP THOSE OFTEN STRESSED OUT YOUNG MOMS UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO AND TO AVOID THE DIFFICULTIES THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO GET THEIR CHILD OFF TO THE BEST POSSIBLE START. WE ALSO HAVE TO INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AT EVERY LEVEL. IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS, I WILL LAY OUT SPECIFIC CAP WILL COME UP A COVERAGE TRULY AFFORDABLE, AND HELP AMERICANS REFINANCE. HELLO LET'S EMBRACE THE IDEA OF LIFELONG LEARNING IN ILLOGICAL CHANGE, WE NEED TO PROVIDE PATHWAYS TO GET SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS FOR NEW OCCUPATIONS AND CREATE ONLINE PLATFORMS TO CONNECT WORKERS TO JOBS. THERE ARE EXCITING EFFORTS UNDERWAY AND I WANT TO SUPPORT AND SCALE THE ONES THAT SHOW RESULTS. AS WE PURSUE ALL OF THESE POLICIES, WE CANNOT FORGET OUR FELLOW AMERICANS HIT SO HARD AND LEFT BEHIND BY THIS CHANGING WORLD FROM THE INNER CITIES TO THE COUNTRY. TALENT IS UNIVERSAL, YOU FIND IT EVERYWHERE. OPPORTUNITY IS NOT. THERE ARE NEARLY 6 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 16 TO 24 IN AMERICA TODAY WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL OR AT WORK. THE NUMBERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE PARTICULARLY STAGGERING. A QUARTER OF YOUNG BLACK MEN AND NEARLY 15% OF ALL LATINO YOUTH CANNOT FIND A JOB. WE HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER WAY OF COMING UP TO MATCH THE GROWING MIDDLE CLASS INCOME IF WE WANT TO GENERATE MORE PATHWAYS INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THE BEST ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM IS A JOB BUT THAT'S HARD TO SAY IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH JOBS FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY. THAT'S WHY I CALLED FOR REVIVING THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT AND EMPOWERMENT TO CREATE GREATER INCENTIVES TO INVEST IN POOR AND REMOTE AREAS. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: WHEN ALL AMERICANS HAVE A CHANCE TO STUDY HARD, WORK HARD, AND SHARE IN OUR COUNTRY'S PROSPERITY, THAT IS FAIR GROWTH. IT'S WHAT I VOICE BELIEVED IN AND IT'S WHAT I WILL FIGHT FOR AS PRESIDENT. THE THIRD KEY DRIVER OF INCOME ALONGSIDE STRONG GROWTH AND FAIR GROWTH MUST BE LONG-TERM GROWTH. TOO MANY PRESSURES IN OUR ECONOMY PUSH US TOWARD SHORT-TERM ISM. THEY TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. ONE IS EVERYTHING FOCUSED ON THE NEXT EARNINGS REPORT OR THE SHORT-TERM SHARE PRICE AND THE RESULT IS TOO LITTLE ATTENTION ON THE SOURCES OF LONG-TERM GROWTH. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TALENT. NET BUSINESS INVESTMENT WHICH INCLUDES THINGS LIKE FACTORIES, MACHINES, AND RESEARCH LABS, HAVE DECLINED AS A SHARE OF THE ECONOMY. IN RECENT YEARS SOME OF OUR BIGGEST COMPANIES HAVE SPENT MORE THAN HALF THEIR EARNINGS TO BUY BACK THEIR OWN STOCK AND ANOTHER THIRD OR MORE TO PAY DIVIDENDS. THAT DOESN'T LEAVE A LOT LEFD. -- LEFT. TO INVEST IN THE WORKERS THAT MADE THOSE PROFIT POSSIBLE OR TO MAKE NEW INVESTMENT NECESSARY TO ENSURE A COMPANY'S FUTURE SUCCESS. THESE TRENDS NEED TO CHANGE. I BELIEVE MANY BUSINESS LEADERS ARE EAGER TO EMBRACE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, NOT JUST AT TODAY'S SHARE PRICE BUT ALSO TO WORKERS, COMMUNITIES, AND ULTIMATELY TO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR PLANET. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT CHARITY, I AM TALKING ABOUT CLEAR CAPITALISM. MANY COMPANIES HAVE PROSPERED BY IMPROVING WAGES AND TRAINING THEIR WORKERS THAT THEN YIELD HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY, BETTER SERVICE, AND LARGER PROFITS. IT IS EASY TO TRY AND CUT COSTS BY HOLDING DOWN OR EVEN DECREASING PAY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS TO INFLATE QUARTERLY STOCK PRICES BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS BAD FOR BUSINESS IN THE LONG RUN AND IT IS REALLY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. WORKERS ARE ASSETS. INVESTING IN THEM PAYS OFF, HIGHER WAGES PAY OFF. TRAINING PAYS OFF. TO HELP MORE COMPANIES DO THAT I PROPOSE A $1500 TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY WORKER THEY TRAIN AND HIGHER. I WILL SOON BE PROPOSING A NEW PLAN TO REFORM CAPITAL GAINS TAXES TO REWARD LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT CREATE JOBS, MORE THAN JUST QUICK TRADES. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: I WILL ALSO PROPOSE REFORMS TO HELP CEOS AND SHAREHOLDERS ALIKE TO FOCUS ON THE NEXT DECADE RATHER THAN JUST THE NEXT DAY. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: MAKING SURE STOCK BUYBACKS ARE NOT BEING USED ONLY FOR AN IMMEDIATE BOOST IN SHARE PRICES. EMPOWERING OUTSIDE INVESTORS THAT WANT TO BUILD COMPANIES, BUT DISCOURAGING CUT AND RUN SHAREHOLDERS WHO ACT MORE LIKE OLD-SCHOOL CORPORATE RAIDERS, AND NOWHERE WILL THE SHIFT FROM SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ON WALL STREET. AS A FORMER SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, I KNOW FIRSTHAND THE ROLE THAT WALL STREET CAN AND SHOULD PLAY IN OUR ECONOMY. HELPING MAIN STREET GROW AND PROSPER. AND BOOSTING NEW COMPANIES THAT MAKE AMERICA MORE COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW IN THE YEARS BEFORE THE CRASH, FINANCIAL FIRMS PILED AT RISK UPON RISK. AND REGULATORS AND WASHINGTON EITHER COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT KEEP UP. I WAS ALARMED BY THIS GATHERING STORM AND CALLED FOR ADDRESSING THE RISKS OF DERIVATIVES, CRACKING DOWN ON SUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND IMPROVING FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP WE HAVE IMPOSED TOUGH NEW RULES THAT DEAL WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ON WALL STREET. THOSE RULES HAVE BEEN UNDER ASSAULT BY REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND THOSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I WILL FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE ATTACKS AND PROTECT THE REFORMS WE HAVE MADE. WE CAN DO THAT AND STILL EASE BURDENS ON COMMUNITY BANKS TO ENCOURAGE RESPONSIBLE LOANS TO LOCAL PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THEY KNOW AND TRUST. WE ALSO HAVE TO GO BEYOND. FRANK -- DODD-FRANK. SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE STILL TOO COMPLEX AND RISKY. THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE BIG BANKS THAT GET ALL THE HEADLINES. SERIOUS RISKS ARE EMERGING FROM INSTITUTIONS IN THE SO-CALLED SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM, INCLUDING HEDGE FUNDS, HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADERS, NON-BANK FINANCE COMPANIES. SO MANY NEW KINDS OF ENTITIES WHICH RECEIVE LITTLE OVERSIGHT AT ALL. STORIES OF MISCONDUCT BY INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ARE SHOCKING. HSBC ALLOWING DRUG CARTELS TO LAUNDER MONEY, FIVE MAJOR BANKS PLEADING GUILTY TO FELONY CHARGES FOR CONSPIRING TO MANIPULATE CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THERE CAN BE NO JUSTIFICATION OR TOLERANCE FOR THIS KIND OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: WHILE INSTITUTIONS HAVE PAID LARGE FINES AND IN SOME CASES ADMITTED GUILT, TOO OFTEN IT HAS SEEMED THAT THE HUMAN BEINGS RESPONSIBLE GET OFF WITH LIMITED CONSEQUENCES OR NONE AT ALL, EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE ALREADY POCKETED THE GAMES. THIS IS WRONG. ON MY WATCH IT WILL CHANGE. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN, I WILL OFFER PLANS TO REIN IN EXCESSIVE RISKS ON WALL STREET AND ENSURE THAT STOCK MARKETS WORK FOR EVERYDAY INVESTORS, NOT JUST HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADERS AND THOSE WITH THE BEST OR FASTEST CONNECTIONS. I WILL APPOINT AND EMPOWER REGULATORS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT TOO BIG TO FAIL IS STILL TOO BIG A PROBLEM. WE WILL ENSURE -- [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: WE WILL ENSURE THAT NO FIRM IS TOO COMPLEX TO MANN --OVERSEE. WE WILL ALSO PROCESS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS FIRMS WHEN THEY COMMIT FRAUD FOR WRONGDOING. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: WHEN THE GOVERNMENT RECOVERS MONEY FROM CORPORATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS FOR HARMING THE PUBLIC, IT SHOULD GO INTO A SEPARATE TRUST FUND TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC. IT COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, HELP WATER KNIVES INFRASTRUCTURE OR EVEN BE RETURNED -- MODERNIZE INFRASTRUCTURE OR BE RETURNED TO HELP TAXPAYERS. WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. YES, WE NEED LEADERSHIP FROM THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND ACROSS THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO JOIN WITH US. TWO YEARS AGO, TERRY DUFFY PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT REALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. HE WROTE HE WAS CONCERNED THAT THOSE OF US IN FINANCIAL SERVICES IN HAVE FORGOTTEN WHO THEY SERVE IN THE PUBLIC KNOWS IT. SOME CAN SLIP INTO REGARDING THEIR WORK AS A KIND OF MONEYMAKING GAME, DIVORCED FROM CONCERNS OF THE MAIN STREET. I THINK WE SHOULD LISTEN TO TERRY DUFFY. OF COURSE, LONG-TERM GROWTH IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF THE PUBLIC-SECTOR STEPS UP AS WELL. IT IS TIME TO END THE ERA OF BUDGET BRINKMANSHIP AND STOP CAREENING FROM ONE SELF-INFLICTED CRISIS TO ANOTHER. IT IS TIME TO STOP HAVING DEBATES OVER THE SMALL STUFF AND FOCUS HOW WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE THE BIG STUFF TOGETHER. HOW DO WE RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND A WAY THAT CREATES MORE GOOD JOBS THAN IT DISPLACES OR DESTROYS? CAN WE SUSTAIN ADVANCED MANUFACTURING? WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO NURTURE STARTUPS OUTSIDE OF THE SUCCESSFUL CORRIDORS OF SILICON VALLEY? QUESTIONS LIKE THESE DEMAND THOUGHTFUL AND MATURE DEBATE. SOME POLICYMAKERS AND GOVERNMENT FROM OUR LEADERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, OUR ECONOMISTS, ACADEMICS, OTHERS WHO CAN COME TOGETHER AND ON BEHALF OF AMERICA PERFORM THEIR PATRIOTIC DUTY TO MAKE SURE OUR ECONOMY KEEPS WORKING AND OUR MIDDLE CLASS KEEPS GROWING. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE SMARTER, SIMPLER, MORE FOCUSED ON LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS THAN SHORT-TERM POLITICS. AND BE A BETTER PARTNER TO THE CITY, STATE, AND PRIVATE SECTOR. WASHINGTON HAS TO BE A BETTER STEWARD OF AMERICA'S TAX DOLLARS AND AMERICA'S TRUST. AND PLEASE, LET'S GET BACK TO MAKING DECISIONS THAT RELY ON EVIDENCE MORE THAN IDEOLOGY. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEEK OUT AND WELCOME ANY GOOD IDEA THAT IS ACTUALLY BASED ON REALITY. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: I WOULD HAVE PRINCIPLES AND PRAGMATIC AND REGRESSIVE POLICIES THAT REALLY MOVE US FORWARD TOGETHER, AND I WILL PROPOSE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK IS SUSTAINABLE, INCLUDING BY CONTINUING TO RESTRAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS, WHICH REMAINED ONE OF THE KEY DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM DEFICIT. I WILL MAKE SURE WASHINGTON LEARNS FROM HOW WELL LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BUSINESSES, AND NONPROFITS ARE WORKING TOGETHER IN THE SUCCESSFUL CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA. PASSING LEGISLATION IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO DRIVE PROGRESS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL USE THE POWER TO CONVENE, CONNECT, AND COLLABORATE. TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS THAT ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE. ABOVE ALL, WE HAVE TO BREAK OUT OF THE POISONOUS PARTISAN GRIDLOCK AND FOCUS ON THE LONG-TERM NEEDS OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: I CONFESS, MAYBE IT'S THE GRANDMOTHER IN ME BUT I BELIEVE THAT PART OF PUBLIC SERVICE IS PLANTING TREES UNDER WHOSE SHADE YOU WILL NEVER SET. THE VISION I HAVE LAID OUT FOR STRONG GROWTH, FAIR GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM GROWTH, ALL WORKING TOGETHER WILL GET INCOMES RISING AGAIN. IT WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT IS THE TEST OF OUR TIME. I AM INVITING EVERYONE TO PLEASE JOIN ME TO DO YOUR PART. THAT IS WHAT GREAT COUNTRIES DO, THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY ALWAYS HAS DONE. WE RISE TO CHALLENGES. IT'S NOT ABOUT LEFT, RIGHT, OR CENTER. IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. VERSUS THE PAST. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BUILD AN AMERICA FOR TOMORROW, NOT YESTERDAY. AN AMERICA BUILT ON GROWTH AND FAIRNESS, AN AMERICA WHERE IF YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU WILL REAP THE REWARD. WHERE WE DON'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. [APPLAUSE] >> WOO! [LOUD CHEERING] MRS. CLINTON: THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE MORE THOUGHT. I WANT EVERY CHILD, NOT JUST THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT OR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT EVERY CHILD TO BE ABLE TO REACH FOR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. LET'S DO IT TOGETHER, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] (music) (music) >> HILLARY CLINTON SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN MANHATTAN,",2015-11-07 17:51:49,2015-07-13,New York,New York
http://www.c-span.org/video/?327212-1/jeb-bush-remarks-tallahassee-florida,"Jeb Bush Remarks in Tallahassee, Florida",Jeb Bush,"AND C-SPAN3 TAKING YOU LIVE NOW TO FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY HERE IN TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA, FLORIDA. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JEB BUSH TAKING ON A SEARS OF RECORDS AND HOW HE PLANS TO CONTROL FEDERAL SPENDING IF HE'S ELECTED. >> IT STARTED WITH A GIELGD PRINCIPLE. GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT GROW FASTER THAN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR IT. YOU START WITH THAT PREMISE, YOU REDUCE TAXES FOR INDIVIDUALS, AND YOU ARE FRUGAL AS IT RELATES TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING. >> WHEN JEB BUSH WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR, HE MADE VERY CLEAR IT'S NOT OUR MONEY. IT'S THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY. IF YOUR PROJECT DIDN'T MEET THE PRINCIPLES THAT HE PUT FORWARD, HE WAS GOING TO WHACK IT. >> THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE COINED THE TERM VITO CORE LEONY BECAUSE NO ONE WAS SAFE. >> THE SPENDING DIDN'T GO THROUGH ANY PROCESS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ANY FLORIDIAN PROUD, SO THAT BUDGET DISCIPLINE WAS IMPORTANT. >> IN USING THE VETO PARTY. >> YOU CAN DO THIS. IT REQUIRES LEADERSHIP. IT REQUIRES ROLLING UP YOUR SLEEVES AND TRYING TO FIX PROBLEMS INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS ON THE SIDELINES. >> HE CHANGED THE CULL FUR IN TALLAHASSEE AND HE CAN CHANGE THE CULTURE IN WASHINGTON. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME FORMER GOVERNOR JEB BUSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. BOBBY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON A BEAUTIFUL FLORIDA MORNING. I GET TO TRAVEL AROUND ALL THE PLACES. LAST WEEK I WAS IN LAS VEGAS AND THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT DRY HEAT LIKE IT'S SOME REALLY COOL THING WHEN IT'S 110 DEGREES. I KIND OF LIKE HUMIDITY MYSELF BEING FROM FLORIDA. AND IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN TALLAHASSEE TO SEE SO MANY FRIENDS. WHERE'S ED BURR, CHAIRMAN OF -- I THOUGHT HE WAS HERE -- CHAIRMAN OF FSU'S BOARD OF TRUSS TEES. I SAW EDWARD BENZ, FORMER CHAIR OF FSU's BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THANK YOU, ALAN. I GOT A CHANCE TO SEE YOUR GREAT PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT THRASHER WHO IS BACK THERE. IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE WITH MY FRIENDS. WE'RE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF A LONG CAMPAIGN AND I'M MAKING MY CASE TO THE VOTERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TIME HAVING A BLAST DOING IT BY THE WAY. IT IS WITH SUCH JOY THAT I GET TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. PEOPLE ARE READY TO CHOOSE A NEW PRESIDENT. AMONG REPUBLICANS, THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF CHOICES TO CHOOSE FROM. THEY WANT TO KNOW, THE VOTERS DO, WHAT WE BELIEVE, BUT ALSO WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED. AND FOR ME THAT STORY BEGINS RIGHT HERE IN TALLAHASSEE. IN MY EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE, WE DIDN'T JUST MARK TIME. WE FILLED THOSE YEARS WITH HARD WORK AND REAL REFORM. IT WASN'T ALWAYS A SMOOTH PACKET. IN FACT, WE USED TO CALL THIS CITY MT. TALLAHASSEE BECAUSE IT WAS REMOTE FROM THE PEOPLE, CAUGHT UP IN THE SUBTLE WAYS OF A COMFORTABLE ESTABLISHMENT. I WAS A GOVERNOR WHO REFUSED TO GO ALONG WITH THAT ESTABLISHMENT. I WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE CLUB, AND THAT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. SHOULD I WIN THIS ELECTION, YOU WON'T FIND ME DEFERRING TO THE WAYS OF MT. WASHINGTON. THE OVERSPENDING, THE OVERREACHING, THE ARROGANCE, THE SHEER INCOMPETENCE OF THE CITY ARE SOMETIMES -- THEY'RE TREATED AS THOUGH IT'S A FACT OF LIFE, THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT. BUT A PRESIDENT SHOULD NEVER ACCEPT THEM, AND I WILL NOT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WILLING TO CHALLENGE THE WHOLE CULTURE IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, AND I MEAN TO DO IT. NAME ANY EXCESS OR ABUSE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN THESE PAST FEW YEARS IT'S GOTTEN WORSE. THE RUSH TO PUT UP NEW HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY COULDN'T PUT UP A WEBSITE TO GO WITH IT. CARING FOR VETERANS AT THE VCHLT A. VETERANS DIED WHILE WAITING FOR HELP. BUT ONLY TWO PEOPLE WERE FIRED FOR LYING ABOUT THE WAIT TIMES. TWO PEOPLE. WE TRUST VETERANS. WE TRUSTED THEM TO FIGHT FOR US. WE SHOULD TRUST THEM TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN DOCTOR. AND REFORMING V.A. WILL BE A HIGH PRIORITY. THE PARTISAN ABUSES OF THE IRS AND THE COVERUP THAT FOLLOWS, ALL OF WHICH TO THIS DAY HAVE GONE UNPUNISHED, AND THERE'S THE WHOLE SALE LOSS OF PERSONAL AND SECURITY INFORMATION TO CYBER HACKS IN CHINA BECAUSE THE POLITICAL HACKS IN OPM IGNORED THE OFFICIAL WARNINGS. YOU REMEMBER THE WARNINGS WE GOT IN THE GENERAL DEPARTMENTS? THERE WAS ONE FOR OPM. ID SATE WE HAVE LAX SECURITY AND THERE'S GOING TO BE SECURITY BREACHES. IT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED BY THE TIME THE REPORT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND TODAY WE NOW KNOW 22 MILLION PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED AND THAT THE INFORMATION TAKEN INCLUDES INTRUSIVE QUESTIONNAIRES USED FOR VETTING PURPOSES. I FOUND OUT THE VETTING PROCESS IS 100 PAGES LONG WITH ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION, A TREASURE TROVE OF INFORMATION FOR A COUNTRY SEEKING TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COUNTRY. WHAT DOES THAT SAY THEN WITH ALL THE RESOURCES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN PROTECT VITAL DATA FROM A HOSTILE ACTOR. RARELY HAS INCOMPETENCE CARRIED SUCH A PRICE IN GOVERNMENT. INEPTITUDE OF THIS ORDER IS ENOUGH TO SOUND THE ALARM ALL BY ITSELF. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE NORM, WHEN THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND FEW EVEN EXPECTED ANYMORE, THAT'S WHEN WE REALLY NEED TO WORRY. IT'S COME TO THE POINT WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE ENTIRE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT THAT IT SO PERFECTLY REPRESENTS THAT IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALFRED E. NEWMAN. LET ME WORRY. IT'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE FAULT. THE CHALLENGE IS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THEIR GOVERNMENT WORKS FOR THEM. I BELIEVE IT CAN. AND I WILL TAKE THE SKILLS I LEARNED WITH MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM TO MAKE IT SO. DON'T GET ME WRONG. I HAVE NOT SO FOND MEMORIES BUT I CERTAINLY HAVE MEMORIES DURING MY TIME IN GOVERNMENT HERE WHEN IT WASN'T PERFECT. BUT THAT'S PART OF BEING A LEADER IS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN THINGS GO WRONG. AFTER THE 2000 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RECOUNT WE MOVED DECISIVELY TO IMPROVE OUR LAWS. WHEN THE TRAGEDY OF WILLIE WILSON TOOK PLACE AND EXPOSED THE SHORT COMINGS OF OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM, WORKING WITH THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE, WE STEPPED UP OUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY-BASED CARE AND MADE THEM MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE TO CHILDREN IN NEED. AND WHEN SENIOR PEOPLE IN MY ADMINISTRATION VIOLATED THE PUBLIC TRUST, THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR JOBS. WHEN THESE PROBLEMS OCCURRED, I TOOK RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S WHAT FLORIDIANS DESERVED. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT'S BEEN LACKING IN WASHINGTON AND THAT'S THE KIND OF LEADERSHIPLY LYLY LYLY I WILL BRING TO WASHINGTON, D.C. [ APPLAUSE ] >> FOR ANYONE WHO WANTED TO SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BIGGER THAN THOSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO SERVE, THE OTHER PARTY WILL BE OFFERING THAT OPTION. AS FOR ME, I'M OFFERING A DIFFERENT AGENDA AWL TOGETHER. IT WILL BE MY INTENTION NOT TO PRESIDE OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT BUT IN EVERY WAY I KNOW TO DECEMBER ERUPT THAT ESTABLISHMENT AND MAKE IT MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE ULTIMATE DISRUPTION IS TO REJECT AS I DO THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE GOVERNMENT FOREVER GROWING MORE, BORROWING MORE, AND SPENDING MORE BEYOND ANYBODY'S ABILITY TO CONTROL IT OR EVEN COMPREHEND IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT REFORM REALLY TAKES. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS GOT TO CONFRONT THE SPENDING CULTURE IN WASHINGTON, AND I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO IT. I THINK WE'VE LEARNED BY NOW YOU CAN HAVE A FAST GROWING ECONOMY OR FAST EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE AS I DID AS WE WORK TOGETHER WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR OF THE NOW THIRD LARGEST STATE. IN MY TIME IN OFFICE FLORIDA'S ECONOMY EXPANDED 4.4% PER YEAR, MORE THAN 50% MORE THAN THE NANCHAL AVERAGE. AT THE SAME TIME GOVERNMENT SPENDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY WENT DOWN. IN FACT, THAT SHOULD BE THE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ITS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ECONOMIC GROWTH GROWING FAR FASTER THAN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF WASHINGTON AN ITS BUDGET. WE BALANCED OUR BUDGET EVERY YEAR I WAS IN OFFICE AND INCREASED OUR STATE'S RESERVES BY $8 BILLION. WHO KNOWS. MAYBE THERE WAS GOING TO BE -- WHO KNOWS IF THERE WAS GOING TO WO B AN ECONOMIC CALAMITY OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. WHO KNOWS. WE HAVE HURRICANES HERE. WE WERE REWARRED BY BEING UPGRAUDED TO AAA BOND RATING AND YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS WHERE OUR COUNTRY HASSED A A DOWNGRADE T FIRST ONE IN ITS HISTORY. I VETOED MORE THAN 2,100 SPENDING ITEMS. THAT WASN'T PUNITIVE. IN FACT, I THINK SPEAKER THRASHER AND BENZ AGREE I WAS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY VETO. THIS WAS TO CREATE A PROCESS SO WE COULD HAVE $9 BILLION OF RESERVES, WRE WE DIDN'T HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT GREW FASTER THAN THE PEOPLE'S INCOME IN THE STATE. WE NEED THE EXACT SAME THING IN WASHINGTON. WE SHOULD HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA OF VETO CORE LEE OHLNEYOLNEY. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INSOUTH SULT, BUT THE FACT IS I LIKED IT A LOT. I CUT THE STATE BUREAUCRACY BY MORE THAN 10% TRYING TO LIVE UP TO MY INAUGURAL TO MAKE BUILDINGS AROUND TALLAHASSEE SILENT MONUMENTS TO A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT PLAYED MORE A ROLE THAN IT COULD DESERVE OR ADEQUATELY WILL. I CITY BELIEVE THAT AS WELL. THEY DON'T NEED THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT WE HAVE. IF WE CAN BUILD IT, BY OUR VERY NATURE WE'LL ALL BECOME CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE THE DEMANDS ON GOVERNMENT WILL SUBSIDE. FROM THE VERY OUTSET AS PRESIDENT I WOULD SINGLE A NEW DIRECTION BY SUPPORTING FUND MENTAL REFORMS THAT GO TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM. FINS WE HAVE TOO CONFRONT AND END THE HABITUAL PRACTICE OF DEFICIT SPENDING. AS LONG AS DEFICITS ARE AN OPTION, DEFICITS WILL BE THE REALITY. . THE REALITY I WILL SUPPORT IS BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT. TO BE CLEAR -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> TO BE CLEAR, IT HAS TO BE PROPERLY DESIGNED SO THAT IT'S A TOOL TO LIMIT GOVERNMENT, NOT TO RAISE TAXES. AMERICANS IN EVERY PARTY ARE RIGHT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE FISCAL INTEGRITY AND SOLVENCY OF OUR GOVERNMENT. IT NEEDS TO BE FIX. I WILL URGE CONGRESS TO SUBMIT A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE STATES AND LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. SECOND, IT IS TIME TO REVIVE VETO CORE LEONY. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESOLVE WASTE 68 SPENDING SUCH AS PAUL RYAN HAS RECOMMENDED TO MAKE SURE IT ABIDE BY OUR CONSTITUTION. OVERSPENDING IS ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS TO ASSERT AINGS NAAL INTEREST EVEN IF NO ONE ELSE WILL. THE POWER TO VETO IRRESPONSIBILITY DUTY IS PART OF THE SPENDING AND I KNOW HOW TO USE IT, TRUST ME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE THIRD SPENDING REFORM IS GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT. FEDERAL AGENCIES SPEND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON EE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES FOLLOW COMPLICATED PROCEDURES NO COMPANY WOULD USE IN A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCESS IS SLOW AND TOO OFTEN IT HOLDS NO ONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR BEING OVER BUNT. ONE OF THE MOST TRACKIC EXAMPLES I'VE SEEN O THE ROAD IS A V.A. HOSPITAL MANY YEARS IN THE MAKING THAT WAS CUPSUPPOSED TO COST $2.8 MILLION. NOW IT'S $1.8 BILLION. THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IS STILL OPERATING BY THE PROCUREMENT METHODS OF THE COLD WAR. IN SOME CASES BY THE TIME NEW EQUIPMENT REACHES OUR TROOPS, IT'S ALMOST OBSOLETE. SO HERE WE ARE WITH A PENALTY GOB THAT HAS TO CUT MILITARY EQUIPMENT, PAY, AND HEALTH CARE, ALL THE WHILE LOSING BACKWARD WASTEFUL PROCURE MANAGEMENT PROCH SIS. THEY'RE SO SWAMPED ONLY A HANDFUL OF GIANT CON TRACKERS CAN COMPETE. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT INITIATIVES OF THE RESPECKIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE AND JOHN McCAIN, A REAL HERO, BY THE WAY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I DO THAT BECAUSE HE'S GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT AND HE'S REALLY EMBARRASSED THAT I'VE MENTIONED HIM OUT LOUCHLTD IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GOOD BUDGET DECISIONS, WE NEED TO DEAL WITH REAL NUMBERS. THE TRICK IN D.C. IS CALLED BASELINE BUDGETING. IT MEANS THE CURRENT SPENDING LEVEL IS THE STARTING POINT FOR FUTURE BUDGET. BASELINE LIKE YOUR KITCHEN BUDGET LOOKS LIKE THIS, RIGHT? THE BASE IN WASHINGTON IS LIKE THIS. IT AUTOMATICALLY KBROES. THE MINUTE YOU SUGGEST THEY CUT IT YOU'RE EVIL, TAKING AWAY FROM SOMEONE ELSE. IT'S A RATE AT FARMORE THAN THE ABILITY WE CAN PAY FOR U. I'LL WORK WITH CONGRESS TO CHANGE IT. YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WHEN STANDARD ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES SEEM LIKE A SUB SERSIVE IDEA. THAT'S HOW IT IS WITH FEDERAL BUNDING. MEANWHILE ALL THE TAXPAYERS WHO UNDERWRITE IT HAVE TO LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD. IT'S NOT AS FUN AS WORKING WITH MAKE-BEE LEAVE NUMBERS, I'VE GOT THAT, BUT IT CAN GET YOU OUT OF TROUBLE. REAL WORLD PUJTING WOULD MARK A BIG STEP. IN MY ADMINISTRATION, IT WILL BE THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION. YOU MAY REMEMBER SOME OF THIS WHEN IT'S COMING UP. WHEN THEY ASKED IF MORE DEPOSIT AUTHORITY THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED IN DETAILED JUSTIFICATIONS WHY THEY NEED IT AND ALSO TO PROPOSE OFFSETTING CUTS. THE SHORT OF IT IS WE'RE GOING TO TURN OFF THE AUTOMATIC SWITCH OF DISCRETIONARY SPENDING INCREASES AND WEIGH BUDGETETS ONLY ON ITS MERITS. TOO MUCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNS ON AUTOMATIC WHICH MEANS THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING WITH KNOB STOPPING TO ASK WHY. PEOPLE ARE HIRED. THEY'RE PROMOTED. THEY'RE GIVEN PAY INCREASES OFTEN ROUTE GUARD TO PERFORMANCE. MORE THAN EVER, IT'S A SYSTEM IN THE OLD WAY, RULED BY INERTIA AND UNACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE. AND WITH OVER 2 MILL UPGOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ON THE FEDERAL PAYROLL, THESE PROGRAMS AND THESE PROBLEMS CARRY A HEAVY COST AND A FEW SERIOUS REFORMS WILL GO A LONG WAY. MY FIRST REFORM WILL BE TO PLACE A FREEZE ON FEDERAL HIRING. WE CAN EXPECT THAT MORE THAN 10% OF ALL THE CURRENT WORK-FORCE WILL RETIRE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IT'S A FAIRLY SAFE BET THAT NOT EVERYONE WHO LEADS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. EXCEPTIONS FOR CRITICAL POSITIONS LEE LATED TO OUR SECURITY AND SAFETY. ONLY ONE NEW HIRE FOR EVERY THREE THAT LEAVE. WE CAN INCREASE THE BUREAUCRACY. WITH OTHER REFORMS THAT ARE POSSIBLE, WE COULD REDUCE THE BUREAUCRACY BY MORE THAN 10% WITHIN FOUR YEARS MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SAVING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITHOUT ADDING TO ITS PLOIM. WE THAE MADE THOSE TOP CUTS AND WE'VE MADE TOP MARKET MORE ACCOUNTABLE BY DEFINING THEM AS AT-WILL EMPLOYEES. WE COULD BE ASSURED THEY WOULD BE LET GO IF THEY'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. THE EFFECT WAS TO UP EVERYBODY'S GAME, ATTRACT NEW TALENT AND REMIND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THEY'RE THERE TO SERVE. WHETHER IT'S A COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OR A GOVERNMENT WORK-FORCE, THE WHOLE IDEA OF MANAGEMENT IS TO REWARD GOOD PERFORMANCE AND MAKE THE BEST THE STANDARD AND THAT'S NOT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE INWASH WASHINGTON, D.C., RIGHT NOW. LET'S JUST SAY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TAXPAYERS' INTERESTS FOREMOST IN MIND. WE HAVE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE -- WHO'S THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS. IT TIMES TO REFORM ALL OF THIS TO MAKE GOVERNMENTS SMALLER SO WE CAN RISE UP AS A NATION AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE SYSTEM THEY HAVE LEFT US REWARDS LONGEVITY INSTEAD OF PERFORMANCE. MANY FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ARE PAID MORE THAN THEIR PRIVATE SECTOR COUNTER PARTS. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES EARN A LITTLE OVER $1,500 PER YEAR IN WAGES AND NEARLY $16,000 A YEAR IN BENEFITS. THERE ARE A LOT OF EXEMPLARY EMPLOYEES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THEY'RE TREATED NO BETTER THAN THE BAD ONES. JOB SECURITY IS ONE THING. JOB ENTITLEMENT IS ANOTHER. AND EVERY TIME A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE NEEDS TO BE MOVED ALONG, IT SHOULDN'T BE A FEDERAL CASE. THE SYSTEM IS SO BROKEN THAT IN 2013 THE NUMBER OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES TERM NATE FOR CAUSE ACTUALLY FELL TO 0.18%. ONE-FIFTH OF 1 LOW PRESSURE. BEYOND THAT, THE TIME IT TAKES TO REMOVE AN UNPRODUCTIVE EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE MEASURED IN WEEKS RATHER THAN YEARS. JUST LIKE IN THE REAL WORLD, COME PE SANE SHOULD DEPEND ON THE TIME OF WORK AND THE QUALITY OF THE WORK. IF THE AIM IS TO BRING OUT THE BEST IN PUBLIC SERVANTS AND TO IMPROVE MORALE ACROSS THE FEDERAL WORK-FORCE, THEN WE'VE GOT TOT GET THE ENINCENTIVES RIGHT. NO MORE DOLING OUT RAISES ACROSS THE BOARD. IF WE RECOGNIZE SKILL, I PROMISE YOU WE'LL SEE A LOT MORE IN THE RANGES OF CIVIL SERVICE AND TRAKT NEW TALENT AS WELL. WE'LL HAVE ENHANCED FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR MANAGERS WHOSE SKILL AND CAREFUL PLANNING ACTUALLY REDUCE SPENDING. WHEN FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ARE FOUND SQUANDERING MONEY, WE SHOULD CALL THEM OUT ON IT. WHEN THEY FIND WAYS TO SAVE MONEY, WE SHOULD REWARD THEM. IT'S GREAT MODEL WE SHOULD BRING TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO REWARD PEOPLE WHO ARE FOCUSED ON SHRINKING GOVERNMENT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOT TO KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE BUT THE CONSENT IS TO BRING THE GOLF BACK RATHER THAN CATERING ALL TOO OFTEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. [ APPLAUSE ] AFTER ALL, IT'S THE RELENTLESS EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENT THAT MADE LOBBYING WASHINGTON'S PREMIER GROWTH INDUSTRY. SPENDING ON LOBBYING HAS RISEN BY MORE THAN 45% IN THE PAST DECADE. TRANSLATING TO, GET THIS, 1$12.5 MILLION PER MEMBER OF CONGRESS AT LAST COUNT. YEAH. EXACTLY. RESTRAIN FEDERAL SPENDING AND THE BUREAUCRATIC MED LING AND THEY'LL RESULT ON A BIG GOVERNMENT. I SAW HOW IT WORKS. OVER TIME LOBBYISTS AND LEGISLATORS SPENT TOO MUCH TIME GETTING COMFORTABLE. ALONG WITH OTHER CHANGES WE MADE THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW THAT I'VE SIGNED THAT CREATED THE STRICTEST REFORMS IN THE COUNTRY. I'VE SIGNED IT APD THINK THEY'RE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. EVEN BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE I SIGNALED A NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS BY FORBIDDING LOBBYING BY ANY MEMBER OF MY TRANSITION TEAM. AS GOVERNOR WE LIMITED THE ALT OF GIFTS. THE REFORMS I SIGNED INTO LAW. FORCED THEM TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR LOBBYISTS AND COMPENSATION. THEY WERE A LITTLE GRUMPIER BUT NOW I'VE ABOUT NOTICED IT'S TURNED INTO A COMPETITIVE DEAL. HERE'S WHAT I PROPOSE. EVERY TIME A LOBBYIST MEETS WITH ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS, THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED ONLINE EVERY WEEK ON THE MEMBERS' OFFICIAL WEBSITE THAT. SHOULD INCLUDE, BY THE WAY, THE AMBIGUOUS CLASS OF CONSULTANTS WHO LOBBY BUT CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE. THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM ""LOBBYIST"" SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO ADDRESS THE CADRE OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SPECIALISTS POPULATING THE AFFAIRS CAPITAL AS WELL. THEN THERE'S THOSE WHO QUICKLY BECOME LOBBYISTS THEMSELVES AS IF MERELY MOVING ONTO THE SAME BUSINESS END. THEY NEED TO DISCOVER LIFE OUTSIDE WASHINGTON, D.C., WHICH, WHO KNOWS, MIGHT BE OF GREAT SERVICE FOR THEM. THEY DO IT WITH GREAT TALENT AND INTEGRITY AND THEY CAN MAKE A HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WERE SERVING AND I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT RATHER THAN TRANSLATING THIS, STAYING IN WAC AND TRYING TO EXPERIENCE IT. >> IF IF I'M INTRODUCED AS PRESIDENT, I'LLEN CLUD A SIX-YEAR BAN ON LOBBYING FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND THE U STATE SENATE. AND WE'LL TAKE SIMILAR MEASURES AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I WILL STRENGTHEN EXHIBITING PROHIBITIONS THAT DEPART EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES FROM LOBBYING MEASURING IN MY ADMINISTRATION. IT MATTER AS WHAT EXAMPLE IS SET. IT'S EASY TO LAY OUT STANDARD ON PERFORMANCE FOR OTHERS, BUT WHAT ARE HIGH STANDARDS WORTH IF THEY'RE NOT APPLIED TO THEMSELVES. CONSIDER MEMBERS IN CONGRESS WHO SOMETIMES SEEM TO REGARD ATTENDANCE AND VOTING AS OPTIONAL, SOMETHING TO DO AS TIME PERMITS. THE REALITY IS THAT CONGRESS IS IN SESSION FOR TYPICALLY THREE DAYS A WEEK WHEN THEY'RE UP THERE. SO IT'S NOT ASKING TOO MUCH THAT EVERY MEMBER BE THERE AND WORK ON THOEBS DAYS. AND IF IT'S AN INCENTIVE THEY NEED, HOW ABOUT THE ONE THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY WORKER IN AMERICA HAS IN THEIR JOB. IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP, YOU DON'T GET PAID FOR THE TIME THAT YOU MISS. [ APPLAUSE ] >>> OUR LEADERS CAN BE SO IMMERSED IN COMING CAMPAIGNS AND FAR OFF LEGACIES AS TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE PRESENT CHALLENGES AND WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW. THINGS DELAYED IN WASHINGTON HAVE A TENDENCY TO NEVER GET DONE AT ALL. BUT IN THIS ERA OF EXCUSES, WE'RE DRAWING IT TO AN END. THERE'S NO TIME -- THERE'S NO WAY TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME. WE HAVE TO DO IT OURSELVES. WE CAN NO LONGER EXCUSE AWAY WHY OUR SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY DISAFFECTED BY WASHINGTON, D.C., AND I COMPLETELY GET THIS AND UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE ALL OF US FEEL THAT WAY. BUT WE CAN FIX THESE THINGS, I KNOW IT, BECAUSE WE DID IT TOGETHER HERE IN TALLAHASSEE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> Reporter: ALL OF THIS IS PART OF THE CASE I INTEND TO MAKE ACROSS THE STATE. FLORIDA'S HUGELY IMPORTANT IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW IN THE PRY MAY AND IN GENERAL AND, OF COURSE, IN OUR COUNTRY. I'M GIVING THIS RACE MY ALL. SPEAKING TO EVERY VOTER OF EVERY BACKGROUND AND BEING TRUE TO WHAT I BELIEVE. HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE AND HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. FOR ALL OF US, THE COMING YEARS CAN BE AND WILL BE THE BEST TIME EVER TO BE ALIVE IN THIS COUNTRY OF OURS,nd AND I'M READY FOR THE CHALLENGE. [ APPLAUSE ] I'M READY FOR THE CHALLENGE. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE. AND I'M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN TALLAHASSEE. THANK YOU.

AS WE AWAIT THE GOVERNOR'S SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER OUR SINCERE GRATITUDE FOR GOVERNOR KASICH FOR HIS LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE, AND FOR MORE THAN 140 YEARS HERE AT OHIO STATE OUR MOTTO HAS BEEN THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND WE'RE ESPECIALLY HONORED THE GOVERNOR WOULD CHOOSE TO MAKE TODAY'S BIG ANNOUNCEMENT AT HIS ALMA MATER. OUR SCHOOL SONG AT THIS UNIVERSITY, CARMEN OHIO CONTAINS A LINE CARVED INTO THE WALLS HERE AT THIS STUDENT UNION, AND THAT LINE IS HOW FIRM THY FRIENDSHIP, OHIO.

THERE'S A FEELING OF WARMNESS AND HOPEFULNESS IN THE ROOM TODAY, AND WE MUST HAVE FAITH IN THE GOOD CAUSE THAT WE ARE GATHERED HERE FOR, AND THE SUNSHINE. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT DIVINE PROVIDENCE IS SHINING DOWN ON US, AND TO ASK FOR GUIDANCE FROM ABOVE, WELCOME TO THE STAGE FATHER KEVIN MAINY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> GOOD MORNING. LET US PRAY. GOD, OUR FATHER, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH, KING OF ALL THE NATIONS, WE THANK YOU FOR THE GIFT OF THIS NEW DAY, AND ASK THAT YOU BLESS THIS EVENT AND OUR NATION.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S A COMMON ACT OF RESPECT THAT WE VOLUNTARILY PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO OUR FLAG, BUT BEFORE WE DO SO MAY I ASK YOU TO RECOGNIZE SOME UNCOMMON CITIZENS IN OUR PRESENCE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE HYMN ON THE WALL SAYS THE SEASONS PASS AND THE YEARS WILL ROLL, AND WE'RE JOINED TODAY BY MANY VETERANS IN OUR MIDST OF MANY WARS AND CONFLICTS, AND SOME SPECIAL VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM WAR, THE COLD WAR, AND KOREA, BUT IN JUST A FEW WEEKS WE WILL MARK THE 70th ANNIVERSARY, A FULL 70 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II, AT LEAST TWO WORLD WAR VETERANS ARE HERE WITH US TODAY AT 92 YEARS YOUNG, ED TURLO, AND 93 YEARS OLD -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> ANOTHER MAN OF UNCOMMON COURAGE AND FAITH, GOVERNOR KASICH ASKED HIM TO SERVE AS HIS DIRECTOR OF VETERAN SERVICES BECAUSE OF HIS LIFETIME OF SERVICE, AND NOW RETIRED HE CONTINUES TO SERVE HIS STATE AND COUNTRY AS OHIO REPRESENTATIVE TO THE WORLD WAR I CENTENNIAL COMMISSION. HIS NAME WAS SHOT DOWN OVER VIETNAM AND HE SPENT FIVE UNSPEAKBLY TERRIBLE YEARS IN THE TWO CASUALLY CALLED HANOI HILTON, AND YET SOMEHOW HE PERSEVERED AND RETURNED A MAN OF FAITH AND FORGIVENESS TO LEAD US IN THE PLEDGE TO OUR FLAG, PLEASE WELCOME A TRUE, GREAT, AMERICAN HERO, COLONEL TOM MOE.

I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THANK YOU ALL. [ APPLAUSE ] >>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A BIG PART OF THE GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH'S STORY IS ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROSPERITY, AND HERE IS A COUPLE OF A COUPLE DREAMERS. KATHERINE DEWEY IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE MT. CARAMEL BREWING COMPANY IN CINCINNATI, AND FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS SHE AND HER HUSBAND, MIKE, HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO BUILT THEIR DREAM AND PUTTING THEIR WHOLE HEART AND WHOLE LIFE SAVINGS INTO THEIR WORK. IT'S PAYING OFF AND THEY ARE AN EMERGING SUCCESS STORY IN THE OHIO GROWING CRAFT BEER INDUSTRY. THEIR SUCCESS HAS EARNED THEM THIS YEAR'S EMERGING EXCELLENCE AWARD FOR THE CLAREMONT COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING KATHLEEN. >> GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS KATHLEEN DEWEY, AND MY HUSBAND AND I OWN MT. CARMEN BEER COMPANY IN CINCINNATI. WE JUST DON'T MAKE GRAIN, WATER AND YEAST TURN INTO BEER, WE MUST CREATE THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT FOR MOTHER NATURE TO MAKE THE BEER HERSELF. THIS IS KIND OF LIKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE IN OHIO THE PAST FOUR YEARS. GOVERNOR KASICH SAYS THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CREATE JOBS, PEOPLE DO. AS GOVERNOR, JOHN KASICH HELPED CREATE THE RIGHT CULTURE FOR OHIOANS TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST, CREATE, CREATE SMALL BUSINESSES AND CREATE JOBS AND CREATE GREAT BEER AND A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES PPZ I AM NOT HERE AS A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM A POLITICAL INDEPENDENT THAT VOTES MY CONSCIOUSNESS. LIKE US, MANY AMERICANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUSH THEIR DREAMS FORWARD, BUT NOT BECAUSE OF OUR OWN WORK AND OUR EMPLOYEES BUT BECAUSE OF JOHN KASICH'S HARD WORK AND IDEAS, TOO. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. [ APPLAUSE ] I BELIEVE THAT JOHN KASICH, WHAT HE DOES, HE DOES FOR US. ELIMINATING TAXES ON SMALL BUSINESSES, AND BALANCING BUDGET BUDGETS AND A COMMONS SENSE TO GOVERNMENT. JUST THINK OF WHAT AMERICA WOULD BE LIKE IF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPENED EVERYWHERE. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, KATHLEEN. THERE ARE THOSE WORDS, HOW FIRM THY FRIENDSHIP, AND THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS OF JOHN AND KAREN KASICH HERE TODAY, AND FAR TOO MANY TO MENTION, AND MANY OF THE GOVERNOR'S GREAT PARTNERS IN THE OHIO SENATE AND HOUSE ARE HERE TODAY BUT AT THE RISK OF MISSING SOMEBODY, I WILL ASK YOU TO RECOGNIZE SOMEBODY A FEW I SEE QUICKLY IN THE CROWD, THE CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, MATT BOURJOS. THE GREAT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF OHIO, MIKE DUINE. A GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT, AUDITOR OF THE STATE, DAVID YOST. AND THE MAN WHO BELIEVES ALL ELECTIONS SHOULD BE FAIR AND ACCESSIBLE AND MAKES THEM THAT WAY, THE SECRETARY OF STATE, JOHN HUESTED. WE'RE JOINED BY AT LEAST TWO MEMBERS HERE OF CONGRESS TODAY, OLD FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES OF THE GOVERNOR, PAT TEA BURY AND STEVE STIVERS. AND FINALLY, GOVERNOR MARRY TAILOR. ANOTHER GOOD FRIEND OF JOHN KASICH MADE A SPECIAL TRIP HERE TODAY FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE TO BE WITH US. WHY? BECAUSE HE KNOWS JOHN KASICH'S EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS. HOW'S THAT? IN LARGE PART BECAUSE HE IS A MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY AND ACHIEVEMENT HIMSELF SO HE RECOGNIZES WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE ON GREAT CHALLENGES AND PUT TOGETHER THE TEAMS WITH RESOLVE AND RESILIENCE TO SUCCEED, AND GREAT CHALLENGES LIKE BALANCING THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND REFORMING WASHINGTON AND TAKING ON PENTAGON WASTE. HE KNOWS THIS BECAUSE HE WAS THERE AND FOUGHT ALONGSIDE JOHN KASICH, ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. HIS OWN EXEMPLARY SERVICE TOOK HIM TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHERE HE CONTINUED THE FIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHO BETTER TO TELL US WHAT IT TOOK AND WHAT IT TAKES -- DID I MENTION HE IS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, BY THE WAY? WHAT IT TOOK AND WHAT IT TAKES, PLEASE GIVE A GREAT BUCKEYE WELCOME FROM THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, SENATOR -- [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL, VERY MUCH. I WAS CERTAINLY PROUD TO SERVE FOR SIX YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND MET A LOT OF GREAT SENATORS IN MY DAY BUT BACKSTAGE I SAID TO ARCHIE GRIFFIN, YOU ARE A GREAT AMERICAN. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JOHN KASICH. I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM A LONG TIME. HE IS SOMEBODY I AM PROUD TO CALL MY FRIEND. I HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WITH HIM. HE'S BEEN A MENTOR. HE'S BEEN A GREAT LEADER IN CONGRESS, BUT MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY TODAY, I BELIEVE HE WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT TO THE UNITED STATES. [ APPLAUSE ] >> I FIRST MET JOHN KASICH NEARLY 20 YEARS AGO. I WAS A BRAND-NEW MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, A NEWLY MINTED CONGRESSMAN AND ASSIGNED TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE, AND AS SOON AS I WENT TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM IN WASHINGTON AND MET JOHN KASICH, I KNEW RIGHT THEN HE WAS A SPECIAL PERSON. KATHLEEN JUST TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSCIENCE IN EVERYTHING YOU DO, AND CERTAINLY NOT LEAST OF ALL CASTING YOUR VOTE AND SERVING THE PUBLIC. JOHN KASICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT CONSCIENCE. HE DID NOT WORRY ABOUT POLLS OR POPULARITY. HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT. FOR HIS FAMILY, FOR HIS NEIGHBORS, FOR HIS STATE, AND FOR HIS COUNTRY. ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HE LED A GROUP OF YOUNG MEMBERS, YOUNG CONSERVATIVES THAT WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, AND HE LISTENED TO US AND DEBATED AND ARGUED AND AT THE END OF THE DAY HE HELPED US ACHIEVE THINGS THAT WE HONESTLY DID NOT THINK WE HAD IN US. I SAW FIRSTHAND THE ENERGY AND THE SKILL AND THE DEDICATION THAT HE BROUGHT TO THAT FIGHT TO GET AMERICA'S FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER. I SAW THE PASSION HE HAD, THE INCREDIBLE INTENSITY AND FASHION HE HAD FOR SOLVING TOUGH PROBLEMS AND FOR TAKING ON CHALLENGES, FOR TAKING ON CHALLENGES THAT OTHERS WERE AFRAID TO TACKLE, AND THEN, LIKE NOW, WASHINGTON WAS FULL OF POLITICIANS WHO CONSTANTLY TALKED ABOUT CUTTING TAXES OR BALANCING THE BUDGET AND THEY ALL HAD HOPES AND DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS. JOHN KASICH HAS NEVER BENCH OFEN MUCH OF A POLITICIAN AS A LEADER. HE KNEW TALK WAS CHEAP AND TOOK ON THE CHALLENGE. HE CUT SPENDING AND TOOK ON SPECIAL INTERESTS AND HE CUT TAXES AND LED THE WAY TO AMERICA I FIRST BALANCED BUDGET SINCE MAN WALKED ON THE MOON. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE, HE CAN DO IT AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ] ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, JOHN KASICH LED THE WAY TO FIGHT FRAUD, TO CUT WASTEFUL PENTAGON SPENDING, TAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK IN REINVESTING INT IN THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM THAT SERVE OUR COUNTRY. JOHN KASICH IS COMPASSIONATE BUT HE'S ALSO INCREDIBLY TOUGH. HE'S CONSERVATIVE, BUT HE'S GENEROUS. HE'S SMART, BUT HE LISTENS TO US. THESE ARE THE SKILLS THAT MAKE HIM SUCH A UNIQUE AND EXTRAORDINARY LEADER. MORE IMPORTANT, THEY HAVE MADE HIM AN EFFECTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL LEADER, WHETHER IT'S BALANCING AMERICA'S BUDGET, REFORMING AND STRENGTHENING OUR ARMED SERVICES AND RESTORING OHIO TO PROSPERITY, JOHN KASICH HAS DELIVERED A RECORD OF SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THIS RACE CAN MATCH. [ APPLAUSE ] IN MY TIME IN WASHINGTON I SAW HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO ACHIEVE. LEADERS LIKE JOHN KASICH HAVE ALREADY DELIVERED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND -- AND MOST OF ALL, -- AND MY FRIENDS, THAT -- MOST OF ALL, THAT'S WHAT AMERICA NEEDS TODAY, A PRESIDENT THAT DOESN'T NEED ANY ON THE JOB TRAINING. JOHN KASICH IS THAT LEADER. HE'S READY. HE IS STRONG AND TOUGH AND HONEST, AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY JOHN KASICH WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU, SENATOR SUNUNU. I INVITE YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TO LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT OF MUSIC, AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (music)(music) HANG ON, SLOOPY (music) (music) (music) HANG ON (music) (music) HANG ON SLOOPY (music) (music) SLOOPY, HANG ON (music) (music) SLOOPY LIVES IN A VERY BAD PART OF TOWN (music) (music) AND EVERYBODY, YEAH, -- (music)(music) >> Announcer: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME EMMA, REESE AND KAREN KASICH, AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH. (music)(music) >>> WOW, HUH? WOW. STANDING WITH ME, OF COURSE, ARE THE PEOPLE WHO I DEDICATED MY LIFE TO. MY SWEET DAUGHTERS, EMMA AND REESE KASICH. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE BORN. REMEMBER THAT, SWEETIE? [ LAUGHTER ] >> I KEPT SAYING TO THE DOCTOR, HOW'S IT GOING, YOU KNOW? HE WAS TRYING TO DELIVER TWO, AND FINALLY HE LOOKS ME SQUARE IN THE EYE AND SAYS, CAN YOU SHUT UP? I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW. THEY CAME OUT AND I COULD HOLD THEM IN THE PALM OF MY HAND. IT WAS SO SWEET. AND SO I ALONG WITH KAREN HAVE DEDICATED OUR LIVES TO GIVE THEM A BETTER LIFE THAN WE WERE ABLE TO GET FROM OUR PARENTS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY ARE DOING FANTASTIC. EMMA AND REESE KASICH. [ APPLAUSE ] AND MY WIFE. PRAY FOR HER. SHE'S MARRIED TO ME, OKAY? FROM THE VERY TIPS OF MY TOES TO THE TOP OF MY HEAD I JUST LOVE MY WIFE SO MUCH. SUCH A GREAT PARTNER. AND SUCH A GREAT LADY. SO I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, ISN'T IT, THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT NEXT GENERATION IS GOING TO BE IN A POSITION OF GREATER STRENGTH THAN WHAT WE RECEIVED. I GET MY INSPIRATION FROM THE PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE ME. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A FEW OF THE ONES THAT INSPIRE ME. I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH MY UNCLE STEVE. UNCLE STEVE WAS A TOUGH GUY, YOU KNOW. THE SON OF A COAL MINER. ROUGH AND TKPWRUF AND TELL IT LIKE IT IS, AND HE FOUND HIMSELF AT AE MA JIMA. IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE VIOLENCE AND THE BLOOD AND THE DEATH, HE SAID TO GOD, IF YOU WILL TAKE ME OFF THIS ISLAND, I WILL GO TO CHURCH EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. AND HE DID. AND UNCLE STEVE -- WHEN UNCLE STEVE CAME HOME FROM THE WAR, THE BROTHERS ALL SLEPT IN THE SAME ROOM. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT. AND UNCLE GEORGE TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD HAVE NIGHTMARES, AND HE WOULD SPEAK IN JAPANESE, AND HE TOLD HIS BROTHERS NEVER WAKE ME, NEVER WAKE ME FROM THAT NIGHTMARE, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. LET ME SLEEP AND WAKE UP ON MY OWN. UNCLE GEORGE, HE'S HERE TODAY, HE IS RIGHT OVER HERE, HE IS 89 YEARS OLD. [ APPLAUSE ] I SO LOVE MY UNCLE GEORGE. HE'S THE PATRIARCH OF OUR FAMILY. UNCLE GEORGE WAS IN THE INFANTRY, AND HE WAS SCHEDULED TO TAKE A VOTE FROM ENGLAND TO BELGIUM, BUT THE DIVISION HE WAS IN COULDN'T ALL FIT IN THE BOAT, SO THEY ASKED UNCLE GEORGE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. WELL, THAT BOAT LEFT ENGLAND ON ITS WAY TO BELGIUM AND A SUBMARINE LAUNCHED A TORPEDO AND SUNK THAT BOAT AND EVERYBODY ON IT PERISHED. THE NEXT DAY UNCLE GEORGE TOOK ANOTHER BOAT AND HE LANDED IN FRANCE, AND HE FOUGHT WITH GREAT HONOR AND HE RETURNED HOME AND BECAME A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR AND GUIDED YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE NEXT 38 YEARS OF HIS LIFE. WHAT A MAN. [ APPLAUSE ] MY FATHER-IN-LAW, WE CALL HIM POPPSY, AND HE SERVED HIS COUNTRY, AND MOST IMPORTANT, MY MOM AND DAD. YOU KNOW, MOM, SHE WAS A VISIONARY. DIDN'T GET THE EDUCATION. YOU KNOW, HER MOTHER COULD BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH, BUT, BOY, WAS SHE SMART. IF YOU THINK I HAVE OPINIONS, YOU NEVER MET MY MOM. AND MY FATHER, HE WAS THE MAILMAN. THEY CALLED HIM JOHN THE MAILMAN, AND WHEN WE LAID BY MOTHER AND FATHER TO REST, THERE WERE COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT CAME AND SAID, JOHN THE MAILMAN, HE WATCHED OUT FOR AWFUL US. THEY GAVE UP SO MUCH, DIDN'T TAKE -- I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE SPENT MORE ON THEMSELVES, BUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU TOLD THEM, THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT. IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE INSPIRED ME. ALL OF YOU THAT ARE HERE TODAY, YOU ARE THE SAME WAY, AREN'T YOU? YOU GOT THOSE PEOPLE WHO DID SO MUCH FOR YOU, WHO ARE YOUR HEROES. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE FAMOUS. THEY ARE JUST PEOPLE YOU LOVE AND YOU ADMIRE. THAT AMERICAN DREAM IS PIVOTAL FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA TODAY WHO ARE NOT SURE THAT THAT AMERICAN DREAM IS POSSIBLE, THAT THAT AMERICAN DREAM IS ALIVE, AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, YOU WENT OUT AND YOU GOT A JOB AND YOU WORKED AT THAT JOB YOUR ENTIRE LIFETIME. YOU GOT YOUR HEALTH CARE, AND YOU GOT YOUR RETIRE AND EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. TODAY YOU COULD BE A 51-YEAR-OLD MAN, AND ONE DAY AFTER SERVING AND DOING EVERYTHING THE RIGHT WAY, SOMEBODY WALKS INTO YOUR OFFICE AND SAYS, I'M SORRY, BUT WE DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT CONVERSATION? COULD YOU IMAGINE THAT DAD WHEN HE IS DRIVING HOME OR THAT MOM WHEN SHE IS DRIVING HOME? THEY LOSE CONFIDENCE. THEY WONDER WHAT THEIR FUTURE IS. CAN THEY GET ANOTHER JOB? CAN THEY SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY? WILL ANYBODY BE THERE TO HELP THEM? OR HOW ABOUT MOMS AND DADS TODAY, THEY SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE, AND MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE RINGING UP MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DEBT TRYING TO GET AN EDUCATION, AND THEY ARE LIVING IN THE ATTIC, AND MOM AND DAD ARE WONDERING, WILL THEY GET A JOB? WILL THEY PAY THEIR BILLS? WHAT KIND OF A FUTURE ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE? OR, AT THE SAME TIME, WE CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT ALL OF US FEAR GREATLY, AND THAT IS THE PROBLEMS OF BAD HEALTH. CAN I AFFORD THOSE EXPENSIVE DRUGS THAT I NEED TO SURVIVE? WHAT IS IT GOING TO COST ME TO GET TREATMENT, NOT JUST FOR MYSELF BUT FOR ONE OF THE LOVED ONES IN MY FAMILY? WILL I BE BANKRUPTED AND LOSE EVERYTHING I HAVE, EVERYTHING I WORKED FOR? IT'S A REAL FEAR. OR THE FEAR OF THE TSUNAMI OF DRUGS. IT'S EVERYWHERE, ISN'T IT? THE KIDS THAT ARE HERE, AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM, DON'T DO DRUGS, DON'T PUT THAT 1,000-POUND PACK ON YOUR BACK AND KEEP YOU FROM YOUR GOD-GIVEN SUCCESS. HOW ABOUT THOSE THAT STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET? THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT SAY, OH, JUST WORK HARDER OR PULL YOURSELF UP BY YOUR BOOTSTRAPS. I BELIEVE IN ALL OF THAT. SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE THE FORTUNE THAT MANY OF US HAVE. THEY STRUGGLE. THEY STRUGGLE FOR A WHOLE LIFETIME AND THEY RISE. CAN THEY PULL THE REST OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS UP THE LADDER, THE PROMISE OF AMERICA, AND THEY WORRY ABOUT IT. HOW ABOUT IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN? YOU WONDER. THE SYSTEM, I THINK, SOMETIMES JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR ME, AND SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THAT SYSTEM WORKS AGAINST ME. YOU THINK ABOUT THE TROUBLES THAT MANY OF OUR AFRICAN-AMERICANS FACE TODAY IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE WORKED TO PROVIDE EQUAL RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES, SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT SO SURE, AND I DON'T BLAME THEM. OR HOW ABOUT ALL OF US? WE PICK UP THE PAPER, AND IT'S CHATTANOOGA, IT'S FT. HOOD, IT'S ISIS. ARE WE SAFE? ARE WE GOING TO BE SAFE TO GO TO THE MALL? ARE WE SAFE TO LEAVE OUR HOMES? THESE ARE THE WORRIES THAT MANY AMERICANS HAVE. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AS SERIOUS AS THESE ARE, AND THEY ARE VERY SERIOUS, WE HAVE HAD A LOT WORSE, MUCH WORSE IN THIS COUNTRY. THINK ABOUT IT. THE CIVIL WAR. YOU REMEMBER READING ABOUT IT? IT'S NOT JUST NEIGHBORS FIGHTING AGAINST NEIGHBORS, BUT IT WAS EVEN FAMILY MEMBERS, KIN FIGHTING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND KILLING ONE ANOTHER ON A BATTLEFIELD RIGHT IN AMERICA. HOW ABOUT THE RACIAL VIOLENCE THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN THIS COUNTRY? THE EARLY DAYS OF TELEVISION WHEN THEY PUT THE DOGS AND THE GAS AND THE BATONS ON PEOPLE OF ANOTHER COLOR. OR THE WORLD WARS, WHERE MANY IN OUR FAMILIES NEVER CAME HOME, LEAVING WIDOWS AND CHILDREN WITHOUT A DAD. OR THE DEPRESSION, THE DEPRESSION. ASK YOUR GRANDFATHER, ASK YOUR MOM AND DAD ABOUT THAT DEPRESSION. MY FATHER USED TO SAY THAT HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE STORE AND GET SOME FOOD FOR THE FAMILY, AND THE GUY WOULD SAY, WE'LL PUT IT ON YOUR BILL. THERE WAS NO BILL. THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK FOR AMERICA TO GET THROUGH THE DEPRESSION. YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT CRYSTAL CLEAR MORNING AND THE HORROR WE FELT ON 9/11. BUT GUESS WHAT? WE'VE ALWAYS GOT THROUGH IT, BECAUSE THE TESTING MAKES YOU STRONGER, AND IT'S THE CHALLENGES THAT MAKE YOU BETTER. I HAVE LIVED THROUGH THEM AND I HAVE BECOME STRONGER FOR THEM AND AMERICA HAS BECOME STRONGER FOR THEM, AND HERE'S HOW WE HAVE DONE IT. BY STAYING TOGETHER. NOT BY DIVIDING EACH OTHER, BUT BY STAYING TOGETHER WITH OUR EYES ON THE HORIZON, WITH OUR EYES ON THE HORIZON, ABOUT THE FUTURE. [ APPLAUSE ] >>> WE HAVE A LITTLE TOWN IN OHIO, CALLED WILMINGTON. THEY FOLLOWED THAT FORMULA. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THESE FOLKS. THEY PLAYED BY THE RULES. WORKED EVERY DAY. HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE. TEAMWORK. AND ONE DAY AN EMPLOYER SAID, WE'RE LEAVING. WE'RE OUT OF HERE. AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, THOUSANDS OF HARD-WORKING GOD-FEARING PEOPLE LIKE YOUR NEIGHBORS WENT FROM GETTING A PAYCHECK ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON TO VISITING A FOOD PANTRY SO THEY COULD FEED THEIR KIDS. I WAS DOWN THERE IN 2010 AFTER THIS EARTHQUAKE -- ECONOMIC EARTHQUAKE HIT WILMINGTON. WE HAD A CAMPAIGN BUS. MY WIFE WAS WITH ME. WE WALKED THROUGH THAT FOOD PANTRY AND WE LOOKED AT THE PEOPLE AND PREACHERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS AND LEADERS AND CAREGIVERS, THEY WERE AT THE FOOD PANTRY BUT THEY HAD NOT ANY HOPE BECAUSE THEY HAD THEIR EYES ON THE HORIZON. WE GOT BACK ON THE BUS -- I WILL NEVER FORGET IT AS LONG AS I LIVE, AND WE GOT BACK ON THE BUS AND I SAID, FOLKS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND -- SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN WITH ME FOR A LONG TIME SO THEY GOT IT, AND SOME OF THEM WERE ROOKIES. I SAID DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE? THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. BY THE WAY, NEITHER WILL THIS BE. THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. DID YOU SEE THOSE PEOPLE? DID YOU SEE THE TEARS IN THEIR EYES? DID YOU SEE THEM HUGGING THEIR CHILDREN? DID YOU SEE THEM NOT HOPELESS? WE'RE GOING TO JOIN IN AND WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM, BECAUSE IT'S OUR JOB AND OUR MISSION AS HUMAN BEINGS, AS CHILDREN OF GOD, TO WORK WITH THEM AND LIFT THEM, AND GUESS WHAT? [ APPLAUSE ] AND IN WILMINGTON TODAY, THE SUN IS COMING UP. I TOLD THEM THAT THE SUN WOULD COME UP AGAIN. IT HASN'T REACHED ITS ZENITH, BUT THE SUN IS RISING AND IT WILL RISE TO THE ZENITH IN AMERICA AGAIN. I PROMISE YOU IT WILL HAPPEN. LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHO DOES THIS? YOU SEE, IT'S YOU AND ME. SEE, IT'S TEACHERS AND PREACHERS AND MOMS AND DADS, DOCTORS, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, LIKE THAT SWEET MAN IN BROWN COUNTY THAT SAW HIS FAMILY WASHED AWAY OVER THE WEEKEND. KEEP HIM IN YOUR PRAYERS. POLICE AND FIREMEN, AND PEOPLE LIKE MY DAD, THE MAILMAN, JOHN THE MAILMAN, BECAUSE WE ARE THE GLUE THAT HOLDS OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. HOW ABOUT -- AS FOR ME, AS FOR ME, LOOK, I AM JUST TRYING TO DO MY BEST, OKAY? I CAME HERE TO OHIO STATE AND I FOUND MYSELF ON THE 19th FLOOR OF ONE OF THE TOWERS AND YOU COULD HIT IT WITH A STONE FROM HERE, AND I HAD 15 ROOMMATES AND THE PLACE WAS 23 FLOORS HIGH, AND OHIO STATE CAN BE A PRETTY INTIMIDATING PLACE. IT'S BIG. IT'S A BIG PLACE. I LEFT MY DORM ROOM, WENT DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR AND I WALKED JUST RIGHT DOWN THE PATH TO OHIO STADIUM. IT WAS A TIME WHEN YOU COULD ACTUALLY WALK IN THAT STADIUM, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT ONE END CLOSED IN, AND I WALKED INTO THAT STADIUM, AND I SWEAR THIS HAPPENED, AND I WALKED RIGHT TO THE 50 YARD LINE, AND THERE WAS KNOW ONE NO ONE IN THE STADIUM THAT DAY, AND I LOOKED AROUND, ALL OF THOSE SEATS AND THOSE BIG STRUCTURES THAT WERE THERE, AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, EITHER THIS PLACE IS GOING TO TAKE ME DOWN OR I AM GOING TO TAKE IT DOWN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. EITHER IT WAS GOING TO BE ME [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, EITHER IT WAS GOING TO BE ME, OR IT WAS GOING TO BE A PLACE, KIDS, BECAUSE YOU WILL FACE IT SOME DAY, TO HELP ME MOVE FORWARD. YOU KNOW WHAT'S AMAZING? I'M BACK HERE TODAY. YOU COULD THROW A STONE AND HIT THAT STADIUM OR YOU COULD HIT THAT DORMITORY SO MANY YEARS LATER, AND GUESS WHAT? I AM HERE TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYERS, FOR YOUR SUPPORT, FOR YOUR EFFORTS, BECAUSE I HAVE DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! [ APPLAUSE ] >> YOU KNOW, THEY ASK YOU ALL THE TIME, LIKE IT'S A TRICK QUESTION OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS? LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO CATCH YOU, RIGHT? I MEAN, IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION, YOU OUGHT TO BE BACK AT THE 50 YARD LINE AT OHIO STADIUM WONDERING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE. I DO THIS BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE NOT BORN TO SERVE OTHERS? I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. IF WE'RE NOT BORN TO SERVE OTHERS, THEN WHAT WERE WE BORN TO DO? I DO THIS FOR MY FAMILY, OF COURSE, FOR MY SWEET FAMILY, FOR MY NEIGHBORS, FOR MY FRIENDS OF MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS, MANY OF WHOM ARE WORKING WITH ME TODAY 30, 40 YEARS LATER, AND I REALLY DO IT FOR EVERYONE, AND I HAVE TO HUMBLY TELL YOU, AND I MEAN HUMBLY TELL YOU THAT I BELIEVE I DO HAVE THE SKILLS AND I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND THE TESTING, THE TESTING THAT SHAPES YOU AND PREPARES YOU FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB IN THE WORLD, AND I BELIEVE I KNOW HOW TO WORK AND HELP RESTORE THIS GREAT UNITED STATES, AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT'S A DAUNTING CHALLENGE. I WAS JUST AT WENDY'S ON SATURDAY UP HERE ON HUDSON AVENUE AND TWO WONDERFUL AFRICAN-AMERICAN FELLOWS WERE THERE AND I WALKED IN, I WAS STANDING BEHIND THEM, AND ONE SAID I DON'T IF I BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING, AND HE SAID, THAT'S GOVERNOR KASICH STANDING BEHIND ME. YOU BETTER RUN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT TO ME? TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUYS, ONE WITH A BRACE ON HIS KNEE AND ANOTHER WITH A CANE. I SAID, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY THAN I AM, AND THEY LOOKED AT ME AND SAID YOU GOT STATISTICS! SOME ARE GOING TO ASK, AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO DO THIS? YOU KNOW, ALL OF MY LIFE PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. IT'S BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF VERY BIG IDEAS, BIG, BOLD IDEAS. 1976 I WENT OUT TO THE CONVENTION IN KANSAS CITY AND NOT ONLY WORKED FOR RONALD REAGAN, BUT I WORKED WITH RONALD REAGAN AND I GOT TO TRAVEL WITH RONALD REAGAN. I ACTUALLY KNEW THE GUY, THE REAL GUY, NOT FROM THE HISTORY BOOK. HE LOST AT THAT CONVENTION. I HAD BEEN MANAGING FIVE STATES AT THAT CONVENTION. YOU TALK ABOUT LIGHTNING STRIKING ME. I WAS 24 YEARS OLD. THEY WERE ONE MAN SHORT AND SAID CAN YOU MANAGE FIVE STATES FOR THE GOVERNOR. I SAID OF COURSE I COULD. I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT IT. HE LOST, AS YOU KNOW. AND I WAS THERE WHEN HE MET WITH HIS CLOSEST ADVISERS. AND HE SAID WE HAVE LOST THE BATTLE. WE HADN'T LOST ANY WAR BECAUSE WE WILL ALL BE BACK. I'M GOING TO FIX AMERICA WITH ALL OF YOUR HELP. OF COURSE, IT FURTHER CEMENTED MY NOTION THAT BIG IDEAS CHANGE THE WORLD. BIG IDEAS CHANGE THE WORLD! [ APPLAUSE ] SO I CAME BACK HERE TO OHIO AND I WAS CHARGED UP AND WORKING AS AN AID. I CAME BACK AND I REMEMBER MEETING WITH ONE OF MY BUDDIES. I SAID I THINK I'M GOING TO JUST RUN FOR THE STATE SENATE AND BEAT THAT GUY WE HAD BEEN WATCHING. I REMEMBER HE WAS DRINKING SOMETHING AND IT FELL ON THE FLOOR WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT. I WAS 24 1/2 YEARS OLD. I HAD NO RELATIVES THAT LIVED IN THE STATE. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ANYBODY, BUT I HAD A BIG IDEA. WE WENT OUT AND WE GOT MOMS AND DADS, A LOT OF MOMS WHO WENT DOOR TO DOOR AND RANG DOOR BELLS. THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE ELECTION ONE OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS SAID HE IS A FINE YOUNG MAN BUT HE HAS NO CHANCE TO WIN. WELL, I WON THAT ELECTION WITH THE HELP OF THE ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS. I WENT ON TO CHAIR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WHERE I LEARNED TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE BECAUSE THE HOUSE WAS RUN BY DEMOCRATS AND THAT IS WHERE I LEARNED THAT POLICY IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN POLITICS, IDEOLOGY OR ANY OTHER NONSENSE WE SEE. YOU KNOW, THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE. WE PROVED THEM WRONG. AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 30 I DECIDED I'M GOING TO RUN FOR CONGRESS. MY MOTHER AND FATHER ARE LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? WELL, THEY SAID I COULDN'T WIN. I WAS TOO YOUNG. AND BY THE WAY, I WAS GOING TO RUN AGAINST AN INCUMBENT IN 1982 IS LIKE THE WORST YEAR. WE LOST 26 REPUBLICAN SEATS THAT YEAR. I WAS GOING TO RUN AGAINST A GUY WHO GOT ONE OF HIS DEGREES FROM HARVARD. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I HAD AN EDGE. CLEARLY HE COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN INTO OHIO STATE. I KNEW I HAD AN EDGE! IN 1982 I WAS THE ONLY REPUBLICAN IN AMERICA TO DEFEAT AN INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND GUESS WHAT. HERE IS THE IRONY. I GOT TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND WORK WITH PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN. [ APPLAUSE ] THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, BUT WE PROVED THEM WRONG AGAIN. AND THEN I GOT DOWN TO WASHINGTON AND GOT ON THE ARMS SERVICES COMMITTEE WHERE I SERVED FOR 18 YEARS ON NATIONAL SECURITY. I WAS THERE JUST THE BLINK OF AN EYE AND I DISCOVERED THAT HAMMERS AND SCREW DRIVERS HAD COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. IT WAS TAKING THE RESOURCES FROM THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDED IT WHO WERE SERVING IN THE MILITARY. WE WERE WASTING MONEY. I SAID WE NEED TO CLEAN THIS UP. AND THEY ARE LIKE COME ON. IT'S THE PENTAGON. YOU CAN'T -- FORGET ABOUT IT. IT CAN'T HAPPEN. WELL, WE PASSED SOME LEGISLATION AND WE MADE THINGS RIGHT. WE SAVED MONEY. WE IMPROVED THE SYSTEM. AND WE HELPED THE MILITARY. THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE AND WE PROVED THEM WRONG AGAIN. LET ME BE CLEAR, OUR MILITARY MUST BE IMPROVED. WE NEED TO CUT THE BUREAUCRACY AND WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR SERVICES. NOW, I'M A PERSON THAT DOESN'T LIKE TO SPEND A LOT OF MUNONEY, BUT IN THIS CASE NATIONAL SECURITY CLIMES TO THE TOP BECAUSE WE MUST BE STRONG. WE MUST ASSUME OUR WORLD AS LEADERS OF THE WORLD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO SIX YEARS AFTER I GOT TO CONGRESS I GOT ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. I REMEMBER GOING TO THE FIRST FEW MEETINGS. IT WAS LIKE TERRIBLE. I WAS COMPLAINING. I WAS UP HERE AT A GAS STATION AND I'M SAYING THESE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING. SOME GUY WALKED AROUND THE PUMP AND SAID THINGS ARE SO BAD WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THEM? I FLEW TO WASHINGTON AND MET WITH MY STAFF AND I SAID I THINK WE SHOULD JUST WRITE A BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEY SAID THERE IS LIKE 100 PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WORKING ON A BUDGET AND PROBABLY 50 UP HERE AND WE ONLY HAVE SIX. I SAID I KNOW WE ARE UNDER STAFFED AND IF YOU STAY OUT OF OUR WAY WE WILL GET IT DONE. WE WROTE A BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHY? IT'S NOT ABOUT NUMBERS, IT'S ABOUT VISION AND VALUES. WE DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AS GROWNUPS TO RING UP DEBTS TO SUIT OURSELVES AND PASS THEM ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION. WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT. [ APPLAUSE ] 10 YEARS OF MY LIFE I WORKED AT THIS. MY STAFF WAS DEPRESSED. I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING PRETTY WELL. THAT'S HOW I WAS. WELL, WE JUST KEPT AT IT AND KEPT AT IT AND KEPT AT IT. YOU HEARD MY GREAT FRIEND, JOHN, HE WAS A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL MAN. IF JOHN HAD NOT TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO HELP ME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS. HE IS REMARKABLE. WE DID IT TOGETHER. THE POLITICIANS DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING ABOUT BEING RE-ELECTED. THEY CARED ABOUT FIXING AMERICA, PAT. THEY CARED ABOUT GETTING THE BUDGET BALANCED AND GETTING THE ECONOMY GOING. THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE. THEY SAID IT WAS TOO BIG, TOO HARD, TOO MUCH POLITICS AND WE PROVED THEM WRONG AGAIN AND WE BALANCED THAT FEDERAL BUDGET. WE BALANCED IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU WANT JOB CREATION, WE BALANCE THE BOOKS. AM I RIGHT? YOU BALANCE THE BOOKS. IF I'M PRESIDENT OR MAYBE I SHOULD SAY WHEN I AM PRESIDENT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WILL PROMISE YOU THAT MY TOP PRIORITY WILL GET THIS COUNTRY ON A PATH TO FISCAL INDEPENDENCE, STRENGTH AND WE WILL REBUILD THE ECONOMY OF THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE CREATING JOBS IS OUR HIGHEST MORAL PURPOSE AND WE WILL MUCHB TO GET THAT DONE. BY THE WAY, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE BALANCE BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION SO CONGRESS WILL START DOING ITS JOB? SO I LEFT. I LEFT WASHINGTON AND HAD A GREAT TIME. I WORKED AT LEHMAN BROTHERS AND LEARNED ABOUT BUSINESSES. I WENT TO FOX NEWS WHERE I WAS A GIANT TELEVISION STAR. I HAD A GREAT TIME. I HAD A CALLING. IT WAS LIKE HERE IS KIND OF HOW IT WENT. DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT WAS CLEAR TO ME. YOU HAVE AN AMAZING LIFE, A LOT OF SKILLS. YOU ARE GOING BACK. AND I SENSED THAT WHEN I WAS ON THE TRIP AND CAME BACK AND CALLED MY FRIENDS TOGETHER AND SAID I GUESS WE GOT TO DO THIS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID YOU HAVEN'T BEEN IN POLITICS AND HAVE NEVER RUN STATEWIDE AND HAVEN'T DEFEATED AN INCUMBENT IN 36 YEARS IN OHIO. WE PUT TOGETHER A VISION. WE PUT TOGETHER A TEAM. THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE AND WE PROVED THEM WRONG AGAIN. AND THEN WE TOOK OVER THE REINS. WE DIDN'T GO UNPREPARED. WE KNEW WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU -- I'M PRESIDENT I KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THERE IS NO CONFUSION ABOUT THAT. I KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I HAVE BEEN THERE AT ALL LEVELS. WE CAME IN HERE $8 BILLION IN THE HOLE, 89 CENTS IN THE RAINY DAY FUND. A LOT OF HOPELESSNESS HERE PARTICULARLY AMONG THE POOR AND MINORITIES. PEOPLE SAID MAYBE OHIO'S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND HIM. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A BUNCH OF BOLOGNA. I SAID NOT ONLY WILL WE GET THE BUDGET BALANCED I WAS LIKE THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN DO THAT. WE DIDN'T HAVE TO SLASH THINGS. WE JUST HAD TO USE A 21st CENTURY FORMULA AND IMPROVE THINGS, INNOVATE THEM. MAKE A BETTER PRODUCT AT A LOWER PRICE. LET MOM AND DAD STAY IN THEIR HOME RATHER THAN BEING FORCED IN A NURSING HOME. LET THEM STAY IN A HOME WHERE THEY ARE HEALTHIER AND HAPPIER. NOW TODAY 4 1/2 YEARS LATER, $8 BILLION IN THE HOLE, $2 BILLION SURPLUS. A LOSS OF 350,000 JOBS AND TAX CUTS OF $5 BILLION, THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY. AND AS I HOPE YOU ALL KNOW ECONOMIC GROWTH IS NOT AN END INTO ITSELF. IF YOU'RE DRUG ADDICTED WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO REHAB YOU AND GET YOU ON YOUR FEET. IF YOU ARE MENTALLY ILL PRISON IS NO PLACE FOR YOU. SOME TREATMENT AND SOME HELP IS WHERE YOU NEED TO BE. IF YOU ARE THE WORKING POOR WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A PAY RAISE AND NOT BANG YOU OVER THE HEAD BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO GET AHEAD. WE ARE CHANGING THAT SYSTEM. IF YOU HAVE AN AUTISTIC SON OR DAUGHTER FOR MOST OF THEM THEY CAN GET INSURANCE AND WE WILL WORK TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THEM HAVE IT. FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO RISE. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE SUCCESS SUCCESSFUL. [ APPLAUSE ] AND WITH ALL OF THIS THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE. GUESS WHAT, WE PROVED THEM WRONG AGAIN. I'M GOING TO TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED HERE IN THE HEARTLAND THAT BAND OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT I WORK WITH EVERY DAY AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE LESSONS OF THE HEARTLAND AND STRAIGHTEN OUT WASHINGTON, D.C. AND FIX OUR COUNTRY. WELL, YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO SAY WELL, YOU KNOW, NICE GUY OR GOOD GUY OR WHATEVER OR NOT A GOOD GUY, WHATEVER THEY ARE GOING TO SAY. I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN WIN. BUT WITH YOU AND YOU, SWEETHEART, CAN YOU PAINT SIGNS? AND WITH ALL OF YOU, TOGETHER WE'LL PROVE THEM WRONG AGAIN, WON'T WE? WE'LL PROVE THEM WRONG AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ] SO OUR TEAM, WE'LL TAME THE BUREAUCRACY AND RESTORE COMMON SENSE. MARY TAYLOR HAS THE COMMON SENSE INITIATIVE. GET RID OF THE STUPID RULES. HOW ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT UNDERSTAND JOB CREATORS AND RESPECT THEM RATHER THAN BEATING THEM DOWN? HOW ABOUT THAT FOR AN IDEA? HOW ABOUT SOME COMMON SENSE TO MAKE AMERICA STRONGER ERER MILITARILY? HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU AND I SAID THIS AT MY NOG NOGGURAL. SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY DON'T MATTER IN THIS. DO YOU KNOW HOW WRONG THAT IS? WE HAVE THIS HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL AND THERE IS A LINE ETCHED THAT SAYS IF YOU SAVE ONE LIFE YOU HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? IF YOU SAVE ONE LIFE YOU CHANGE THE WORLD. AND THE LORD WILL RECORD WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ANOTHER IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. NOW, WE'VE GOT SOME VALUES THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT CAN BRING US TOGETHER. FOLKS, WE ARE A DIVIDED COUNTRY BUT WE CAN FIX IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE, PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. THE DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK WENT OUT IN THE FIFTH GRADE. HERE IS THE THING. WE OWN OUR LIVES. IF YOU ARE HURTING WE WILL HELP YOU. MY MOTHER USED TO SAY THAT IT IS A SIN NOT TO HELP SOMEBODY THAT NEEDS HELP BUT EQUALLY A SIN TO CONTINUE TO HELP SOMEBODY THAT NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO HELP THEMSELVES. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY NEEDS TO BE RESTORED IN OUR COUNTRY. TEACH OUR CHILDREN. RESILIENCE. EVERYBODY DOESN'T GET A TROPHY JUST FOR SHOWING UP, FOLKS. YOU KNOW WHAT RESILIENCE IS? IT'S GETTING KNOCKED DOWN. I HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN SO MANY TIMES. GETTING KNOCKED DOWN IS NOT THE PROBLEM. IT'S REFUSING TO GET UP. WE NEED TO TEACH OUR KIDS, TEACH OUR CHILDREN ABOUT RESILIENCE AND REMIND OURSELVES THAT YOU'RE 51 YEARS OLD AND YOU LOST YOUR JOB, YOU ARE GOING TO COME BACK STRONGER AND BETTER AND WE'LL HELP YOU. EMPATHY. THIS ONE IS SO IMPORTANT. I JUST WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK. PUT YOURSELF IN THE SHOES OF ANOTHER PERSON. WE'RE SO QUICK TO MAKE JUDGMENTS TODAY IN OUR COUNTRY. DON'T WALK SO FAST. YESTERDAY I WAS COMING DOWNTOWN AND THERE WAS A LADY AND SHE WAS OLDER AND SHE HAD A CANE AND SHE WAS BARELY WALKING. SHE WAS PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF ANOTHER. I WANTED TO STOP AND JUST HUG HER, ENCOURAGE HER. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN DEALT THE BEST HAND IN LIFE, WE WANT TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE BUT THE LORD WANTS OUR HEARTS TO REACH OUT TO THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE WHAT WE HAVE. I MEAN, THAT SHOULDN'T BE HARD FOR AMERICA. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE STUDIED OUR COUNTRY THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT OUR COMPASSION. WE NEED TO BRING IT BACK, EMPATHY. DON'T BE SO QUICK TO JUDGE. ME, TOO. AND THEN TEAMWORK. I KNOW TOM MOW WAS UP HERE. ONE TIME HE USED TO RUN THE VETERANS. I CALL IT THE GREAT ARC OF LIFE. THE MAN GOES IN THE MILITARY AND BEATEN ALL THE TIME IN A TINY LITTLE CELL. HE COMES HOME AND I PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF THE VETERANS. THIS WAS THE BEAUTIFUL ARC OF WHAT IS RIGHT. TOM HAD A CODE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW. HERE HE IS RIGHT HERE. HE TAPPED OUT A CODE THAT KEPT THEM ALL TOGETHER. IT WAS TEAM THAT CARRIED THEM THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES. UNCLE GEORGE, IT WAS TEAM THAT HELPED YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE VIETNAM VETERANS AND AFGHANISTAN VETERANS WE DO BEST OR THE DEPRESSION WHEN WE ALL HUNG TOGETHER. TEAMWORK NOT THE ENEMY. WE CAN DISAGREE. AND THEN FAMILY. LOOK AT THESE FAMILIES HERE. BUILDING BLOCK OF AMERICANS. THE BUILDING BLOCK OF OUR CULTURE. LET'S RECOGNIZE IT. OF COURSE, FAITH. FAITH IS REAL SIMPLE. FOR ME IT IS ABOUT THE DOS AND NOT ABOUT THE DON'TS. GOD DIDN'T PUT US ON THIS EARTH JUST TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES. HE PUT US ON THIS EARTH TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER BECAUSE WE LIVE HERE. THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL TRY TO DIVIDE US. WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME. FORGET IT. I DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THAT NONSENSE. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT BEING TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT SAYS WE THE PEOPLE. BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK THAT I OR ANYBODY WHO BECOMES PRESIDENT OR A BIG SHOT, WE DON'T MOVE AMERICA. WE DO OUR PART IF WE HAVE COURAGE AND INTELLIGENCE, BUT IT'S ALL OF US IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, IN THE FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE'RE THE STRENGTH AND THE GLUE. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF IT. FOR ME, I'M JUST A FLAWED MAN. FLAWED MAN TRYING TO HONOR GOD'S BLESSINGS IN MY LIFE. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND IT. HE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL DO MY VERY BEST TO SERVE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE IN MY MIND'S EYE. WHO ARE YOU? GET UP EVERY DAY, GO TO WORK, WORK HARD, FOLLOW THE RULES, COME HOME, SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY. AND AT NIGHT YOU GO TO BED AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS FOR YOUR FAMILY, FOR YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FOR OUR NATION. AND FOLKS AS IT HAS BEEN SAID MANY TIMES THE LIGHT OF A CITY ON A HILL CANNOT BE HIDDEN. THE LIGHT OF A CITY ON A HILL CANNOT BE HIDDEN. AMERICA IS THAT CITY AND YOU ARE THAT LIGHT! GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA! THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327188-1/former-arkansas-governor-mike-huckabee-r-town-hall-iowa,Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee (R) Town Hall in Iowa,Mike Huckabee,"OUR ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH MY CUP OF THE WHO VISITED THE PIZZA RANCH. HE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON IMMIGRATION, HEALTH CARE, AND RECENT COMMENTS BY FELLOW GOP CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS ABOUT AN HOUR. MYMIKE HUCKABEE: GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TOO FAR TO DRIVE? I'M GLAD YOU CAME TODAY. I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS TIME. NICE TO MEET YOU. WE HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME, WE PROBABLY KNOW EACH OTHER. HOW ARE YOU? I AM TIRED. >> I WONDER WHY? MIKE HUCKABEE: I WOKE UP EARLY. REVIEW AT THE EVENT? WE MET BRIEFLY. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? HOW ARE YOU, SIR? >> MIKE HUCKABEE, NICE TO SEE YOU. MYMIKE HUCKABEE: I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. I CANNOT IMAGINE. JUST OUR LUCK THAT THE ONE GUY ON THE SHOW WAS A CONSERVATIVE CLOWN. [LAUGHTER] [INDISCERNIBLE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT JUST PROVES I'M SPEAKING TO AN INTELLIGENT GROUP. THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR. WE JUST GOT BACK FROM AMES, DOING THE FAMILY LEADERS OF EVENT. IT WENT WELL. A BIG CROWD. YOU WERE THERE? THANK YOU. THAT IS A GREAT PLACE. WELL, IT IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY. >> HE ASKED ME TO INTRODUCE HIM. I WOULD INVITE THE PASTOR FROM THE MONROE METHODIST CHURCH FOR THE PRAYER. >> I AM USUALLY NOT THE ONE, I HAVE TO WRITE MY HEART DOWN ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER TO SAY WHAT IS ON MY HEART AND ON THE HEARTS OF ALL I THINK WHO LIVE IN THIS GREAT NATION. LET US PRAY. OH MYIGHTY GOD, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE, WISDOM, AND LOVE. WE THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED IN OUR MILITARY TO A SURE OUR FREEDOM THAT ALLOWS US TO MEET THIS DAY FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. OUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY FOR THE UNNECESSARY DEATHS OF THE MARINES IN OUR BORDERS. WE REACH OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF THESE BRAVE MAN WHO SELFLESSLY SERVED OUR COUNTRY. AND WE ASK THAT YOU HOLD THEM WITH YOUR LOVE. SOMETIMES, WE FORGET HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE THE FREEDOM TO OPENLY CONGREGATE AND SHARE OUR THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS. LORD, MANY OF US FEEL OUR NATION MAY BE HEADED DOWN A PATH OF DANGER AND IMMORALITY -- WHERE OUR CONSTITUTION IS NOT BEING ADHERED TO IN A WAY THAT IS ALWAYS GUIDED THIS NATION. THE THREATS OF TERRORISM, VIOLENCE, TYRANNY, UNREST IN OUR BORDERS, WE NEED TO EVEN MORE. GOD, HELP US TO FOLLOW YOUR LAWS BEFORE HUMANITY. AND GIVE US THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS IN CONTROL. WE GATHER HERE TODAY WITH GOVERNOR HUCKABEE AS HE MAKES A BID TO BECOME OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BY THIS BE A TIME WHERE WE EXPRESS AND SHARE OUR THOUGHTS. WE PRAY THAT HIS WISDOM, LEADERSHIP SKILLS, PASSION FOR OTHERS, AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU WILL GUIDE THIS GREAT NATION IN THE DIRECTION OF PEACE, ASPERITY, UNITY, AND PATRIOTISM. HELP US CONTINUE TO BE THE GREAT NATION FOUNDED BY YOU, GOD. AND BLESS THIS TIME WE SHARE TOGETHER WITH GOVERNOR HUCKABEE. IN JESUS' NAME WE PRAY, AMEN. >> STAND AND JOIN IN THE PLEDGE WITH ME. >> I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. >> THANK YOU. >> IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE OUR GUEST HERE TODAY, THE GOVERNOR -- HE WAS THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. THE GOVERNOR FOR 11 YEARS, THE LONGEST-SERVING GOVERNOR IN HISTORY OF THAT STATE. I TELL YOU, THE FIRST TIME I MET THE GOVERNOR WAS WHEN HE WAS COMING THROUGH HERE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. AND WE WERE AT THE STRAW POLL IN AMES. AND HE WAS ON STAGE PLAYING HIS GUITAR. I MISSED SEEING YOU ON THE SATURDAY EVENINGS, TOO. I ENJOYED THAT. GOVERNOR HUCKABEE: I MISS THAT. >> THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN AN AVID MUSICIAN SINCE HE WAS 11. [LAUGHTER] GOVERNOR HUCKABEE: I WILL NEED HELP GETTING UP. >> THEY TELL ME HERE HE IS 69. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT WAY. 89. YES SIR. I WAS A SCHOOL SPEAKING SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I DID A LOT OF SPEAKING AT SCHOOLS. I WENT TO A CAMPUS AND TALK TO KIDS. FIRST OF ALL, THEY ARE SO HONEST. THEY JUST LET YOU HAVE IT. AND I WAS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND SO, THE KIDS WERE OUT THERE KIND OF RESTLESS. I GOT UP AND SAID, OK, BY THE WAY, HOW OLD ARE YOU GUYS? YOU ARE ABOUT NINE YEARS OLD? THAT IS ABOUT HOW OLD MOST WERE. I SAID, HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM? AND ONE KID SAID 76? I SAID KID, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO GET OUT THE THIRD GRADE. [LAUGHTER] SOME THINGS THE GOVERNOR CANNOT DO, THAT IS SOMETHING I CAN MAKE HAPPEN. EXPEL THAT CHILD, DON'T LET THEM HAVE A SEAT. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING OUT AND 4:30 ON A SATURDAY. IT IS A TOUGH TIME, WE JUST GOT BACK FROM AMES, AND 3000 OF YOUR FELLOW IOWANS WERE THERE AT THE FAMILY LEADER CONFERENCE. IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT GIVE US THE CONFIDENCE TO HAVE A KIND OF INTIMACY WHERE WE CAN VISIT. AND I WILL DO SOMETHING THAT HILLARY WILL NOT DO. I WILL ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY. I AM NOT GOING TO PUT THE PRESS INSIDE OF A ROPE. I THINK THAT IS A PRESS. LUS. I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOU BEING HERE TODAY. EIGHT YEARS AGO, WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT, I CAME TO PLACES LIKE THIS IN IOWA. THE TRUTH IS, WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT, I HAD FEWER PEOPLE THAN ON THIS FIRST ROW RIGHT HERE. AND IT WAS JUST INCH BY INCH, LITTLE BY LITTLE WE KEPT BUILDING A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WERE WILLING TO SUPPORT ME. AND WHEN WE WON THE IOWA CAUCUSES IN 2008, WE ENDED UP HAVING THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CAUCUS VOTERS FOR ME THAT HAVE EVER VOTED FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET IN THE HISTORY OF THE IOWA CAUCUS. THE GOOD NEWS IS, THAT IS A WONDERFUL MILESTONE. BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I THINK FOR ONE MINUTE THAT I CAN JUST SHOW UP A FEW TIMES IN IOWA AND SAY, WELL YOU VOTED FOR ME BEFORE? I EXPECT YOU TO DO IT AGAIN. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. BUT I HAVE NO EXPECTATION THAT THERE IS ANY OBLIGATION PEOPLE WOULD DO IT AGAIN. I HAVE TO EARN IT, THIS LIKE LAST TIME. I HOPE I CAN DO THAT. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY. AND IF I DID NOT THINK THAT, BELIEVE ME, I WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE WONDERFULLY PLEASANT JOB AND I'VE HAD FOR THE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS. OVER THE PAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY, I HAVE BEEN A CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE. AND I CAN SAY TO YOU THAT IS HARD WORK. WE GET MUSIC. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS EXCELLENT COMING FROM ANOTHER ROOM. THAT IS NOT IN HERE. AND THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO? IT IS IN THE SPEAKER'S NEXT DOOR. SO LET ME PICK UP BACK HERE. RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS REALLY HARD WORK. THEN I GOT ELECTED HIM LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THEN GOVERNOR. THAT IS EVEN HARDER WORK. IT IS A CHALLENGE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GOVERN IN A STATE LIKE ARKANSAS WHERE IT WAS THE MOST PARTISAN STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND I KNOW THAT MAY BE A SURPRISE TO YOU, BUT ARKANSAS IS MORE PARTISAN -- WE HAD MORE LOPSIDED POLITICAL STRUCTURE THE MASSACHUSETTS DID, VERMONT, MAINE, OREGON, CALIFORNIA. ANY STATE -- THE MOST IN THE COUNTRY. AND SERVING AS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AFTER THREE YEARS, GOVERNOR FOR 10 HALF YEARS, I CAN TELL YOU THAT WAS HARD. THE LAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS, I HOSTED A TALK SHOW ON TELEVISION. I HAVE DONE RADIO TALK, BOTH COMMENTARY AND A TALK SHOW. I DRIVE AROUND MAKING SPEECHES. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. TALKING ABOUT THE CANDIDATES AND OFFICEHOLDERS, THAT IS THE EASIEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD MY LIFE. [LAUGHTER] AND IT PAID BETTER MONEY THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE. I GOT AMUSED WHEN SOME REPORTERS WROTE THAT HUCKABEE IS NOT SERIOUS. HE IS JUST TRYING TO BUILD HIS PROFILE SO WE CAN GET A TV SHOW, SELL SOME BOOKS, MAKES AND SPEECHES. I AM THINKING, WHAT IDIOT WROTE THAT? I HAD A TELEVISION SHOW, I HAVE WRITTEN 12 BOOKS, I HAVE MORE SPEECHES THAN I CAN ACCEPT. THAT IS WHAT I WALKED AWAY FROM TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THE ONLY REASON I WOULD DO THAT IS BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY IS IN REAL TROUBLE. SOMETHING I HAD THAT I DID NOT HAVE A YEARS AGO, FIVE GRANDKIDS. BY THE WAY, ALL FIVE OF THEM ARE FOUR AND UNDER. [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THEM IS LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS OLD, THE LITTLE BOY GEORGE. AND THE OLDEST ONE JUST TURNED FOUR ON THE SECOND OF THIS MONTH. IMAGINE HOW LOUD THINGS ARE WHEN THEY'LL GET TOGETHER? [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE MY GRANDKIDS. IT OR RUNNING BECAUSE I WANT TO SAY THE NATION FOR THEM OR I AM RUNNING BECAUSE THAT WAY I DO NOT HAVE TO HEAR HOW LOUD THEY CAN BE WHEN THEY ARE ALTOGETHER. [LAUGHTER] I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE REASON ANYBODY WOULD DO THIS HAS TO BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN EGO. I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS TOO LONG TO LET YOU GO BE THE REASON I RAN A CAMPAIGN. THE GLORY OF BEING A POLITICAL CANDADIDATE DISAPPEARS AFTER 15 MINUTES. NOTHING IS BETTER THAN BEING ON TV. PEOPLE LOVE YOU. YOU RUN FOR OFFICE, BEFORE HATE YOU. AND THAT IS YOUR OWN FAMILY. [LAUGHTER] LET ME SAY VERY HONESTLY, I AM BLESSED. MY WIFE WAS A LITTLE UPSET WITH ME FOR NOT RUNNING FOUR YEARS AGO. NOBODY IS A STRONGER SUPPORTER AND A MORE COMMITTED PARTICIPANT IN THIS PROCESS THAN SHE IS. AND FRANKLY, I WOULD NOT BE DOING IT IF I DID NOT HAVE HER WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT. THIS IS HARD TO DO. WHEN YOUR FAMILY IS WITH YOU, I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. IF YOUR FAMILY IS NOT WITH YOU. FRANKLY, A DIVIDED FAMILY IS SOMETHING NONE OF US IN AFFORD TO HAVE. BUT WE HAVE A DIVIDED COUNTRY. A SEVERELY DIVIDED COUNTRY. AND WE ARE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF IT, THE EFFECTS OF IT ECONOMICALLY. I AM IN A TOWN WHERE ONCE MANY MANY PEOPLE WOULD GO TO WORK AT THE MAYTAG PLANT IN NEWTON, IOWA. IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE KNEW IT WAS HERE. I DID NOT LIVE HERE, I LIVED IN ARKANSAS, I DO YOU HAD A MAYTAG PLANT. I REMEMBER WHEN WHIRLPOOL BOUGHT MAYTAG, THERE WAS A BIG PLANT IN MY STATE OF ARKANSAS. I REMOVE OR WHEN THIS PLANT CLOSED, I REMOVE OR WHEN THE WHIRLPOOL PLANT CLOSED. I REMOVE OR WHEN THE ARKANSAS PLANT CLOSE. WE LOST ALL THE JOBS TO MEXICO. A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW, PERHAPS SOME OF YOU FOR ALL I KNOW MAY HAVE ONCE WORKED THERE AND LOST JOBS. I'M TIRED OF SEEING AMERICA LOSE JOBS. I'M TIRED OF SEEING AMERICANS WORK YEAR AFTER YEAR REALLY HARD AT SOMETHING ONLY TO FIND ONE DAY THEY WALK IN AND THEY'RE TOLD THE JOB IS GONE. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TELLING EVERYBODY THE ECONOMY IS IN RECOVERY. I DON'T TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND PLACES LIKE THIS WERE PEOPLE SAY YES, THE ECONOMY IS JUST DOING SWIMMINGLY WELL. PEOPLE TELL ME QUITE THE OPPOSITE. THE ECONOMY IS NOT RECOVERING FOR MANY WORKING AMERICANS. IF ANYTHING, IT STRUGGLES BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD A GOOD JOB A FEW YEARS AGO THAT PAID BENEFITS AND EVEN A PENSION. TODAY, THEY ARE WORKING TWO AND THREE PART-TIME JOBS -- NO PENSION OR BENEFITS. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I WAS IN AIKEN, SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WERE SPENDING A DAY THERE AT THE FAIRFIELD INN. A NICE LITTLE HOTEL, AND LETS YOU HAVE FREE INTERNET AND FREE BREAKFAST. WE ARE CHEAP, WE HAVE TO BE. [LAUGHTER] I GOT DOWN THERE WHEN THEY OPEN FOR BREAKFAST AT 6:00, I WAS ONLY ONE DOWN THERE EXCEPT THE GUY WORKING. HE WAS TAKING CARE OF THE TABLES FOR PEOPLE COMING DOWN TO HAVE BREAKFAST. BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY ONE DOWN THERE, WE STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION. HIS NAME IS MARK, HE IS IN HIS 50'S -- THEY BE A FEW YEARS UNDER THE ME. AND THESE OLD LADIES. [LAUGHTER] JUST SEEING IF YOU WERE LISTENING. WE GOT TO TALKING, UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO, HE WAS ONE OF 300 PEOPLE THAT WORK AT A MANUFACTURING PLANT THERE IN AIKEN. THEY CLOSE THE PLANT, ALL 300 LOST THEIR JOBS. HE WAS A COLLEGE EDUCATED ACCOUNTANT FOR THE COMPANY. BUT THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY CLOSED DOWN, HIS JOB WENT AWAY. THIS MAN HAD A GOOD DEGREE, GOOD JOB, WORKING FOR 20 SOMETHING YEARS, NOW FOUND THAT HE HAD NO JOB. HE WAS WORKING THREE PART-TIME JOBS. ONE OF WHICH WAS TO GET UP AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING AND GO DOWN TO THE FAIRFIELD INN AND SERVE BREAKFAST TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL. HE WOULD GO TO TWO MORE JOBS AFTER THAT. AND HE DID THAT BECAUSE HIS HOUSE IS ALMOST PAID OFF. HE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE IT. HE CAN AFFORD TO MOVE ANYWHERE. HE CANNOT FIND ANOTHER JOB ANYWHERE. AND THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT I SEE HAPPENING ALL AROUND US. THAT IS THE AMERICA WE NEED TO FIX. AND WE ALSO NEED TO FIX AN AMERICA WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER NOT JUST THEY GO TO THE MIDDLE EAST, THEY'RE IN DANGER STANDING OUTSIDE AN ARMY RESERVE RECRUITING STATION OR MARINE RESERVE RECRUITING STATION OR A MARINE AND NAVAL RESERVE UNIT. THAT HAPPENED IN MY HOME STATE OF ARKANSAS. A YOUNG MAN, PRIVATE FIRST CLASS STANDING OUT FRONT OF THE RECRUITING STATION WAS ASSIGNED THERE. YET GONE THROUGH TRAINING. HE WAS SITTING OUTSIDE AS A RECRUITER. A YOUNG, RADICALIZED ISLAMIC JIHADIST FROM MEMPHIS WHO GREW UP A BAPTIST IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD BY THE NAME OF WHAT WAS CARLOS BLEDSOE, WENT TO YEMEN AND CAME BACK. HIS FATHER CALL THE FBI AND SAID I THINK MY SON IS INTO SOMETHING BAD. THE FBI DID NOT TAKE IT SERIOUS ENOUGH. HE HAD SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO DO SOME HORRIBLE THINGS. IT WAS PRETTY BAD AT BEING A TERRORIST. HIS ATTEMPTS FAILED, ONE OF THE THINGS HE WANTED TO DO WAS BLOW UP TIME SQUARE. THAT DID NOT WORK. HE NEVER GOT CAUGHT. BUT ONE DAY HE DROVE OVER FROM MEMPHIS, ABOUT TWO AND HALF HOUR DRIVE TO LITTLE ROCK, TO THE RIFLE AND HELD OUTSIDE OF HIS CAR AND FIRED SHOTS THAT KILLED IN THE LONG AND VERY SEVERELY WOUNDED ANOTHER ARMY SOLDIER. STANDING IN FRONT OF THE ARMY RECRUITING STATION, IN A STRIP'S SHOPPING CENTER IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS. WHEN THIS HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY, WHEN THE SHOOTER WENT ON HIS RAMPAGE AND SHOT UP THE FRONT OF A RECRUITING STATION IN A STRIP SHOPPING CENTER, MY FIRST REACTION WAS -- I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE. IT DOES NOT END WELL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MOST DISTRESSING WAS THESE ARE THE MOST TRAINED, CAPABLE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO HANDLE WEAPONS. BUT WHEN THEY HAVE DUTIES LIKE THAT, YOU MAKE THEM PUT THEIR WEAPONS ASIDE. THEY ARE SITTING DUCKS FOR THE TERRORISTS. DAY ONE, WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WILL BE NOTIFIED THAT MILITARY MEMBERS WILL BE FREE TO CARRY THE WEAPONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE TRAINED. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DISARM OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, ARRANGED, COAST GUARD AND HAVE THEM WALKING AS VULNERABLE SITTING DUCKS SO THAT SAVAGES WILL MURDER THEM IN COLD BLOOD ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA. THAT MUST STOP NOW. PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT DO I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE TO FIX IN AMERICA? THE ECONOMY? OR IS IT NATIONAL SECURITY? I TELL PEOPLE THAT IS LIKE ASKING ME WHICH WING ON THE AIRPLANE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT -- LEFT OR RIGHT? WHEN I FLY, FOLKS, I WANT BOTH WINGS ATTACHED. THE PLANE LIFE BETTER. THE PLANE NEEDS A STEERING MECHANISM. AND NEEDS TO HAVE FLAPS AND A RUTTER, OR ECONOMIC STEERED. WINGS WITHOUT A STEERING MECHANISM STILL ENDS IN A CRASH. AMERICA HAS TO HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY, AND A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT AMERICA HAS TO HAVE. IT HAS TO HAVE A STRONG MORAL FOUNDATION TO STEER THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT MORALITY, WITHOUT A CLEAR UNAPOLOGETIC COMMITMENT TO THE MORAL ABSOLUTES OF THINGS BEING RIGHT OR WRONG, WE DO NOT HAVE A STEERING MECHANISM. AND THIS COUNTRY STILL CRASHES. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT SAYING WE MUST GET THE ECONOMY BACK IN SHAPE. YES, WE DO. AND THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THE FAIR TAX WHICH WOULD END ALL THE TAXES ON WORK, SAVINGS, INVESTMENTS. WE WOULD PAY TAXES AT THE POINT OF CONSUMPTION. WE WITH THE JOBS COME BACK TO THE COUNTRY, CAPITAL COME BACK -- PEOPLE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE AND MAKE THINGS AGAIN. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT PROTECTING AMERICANS OVERSEAS AND HERE ON OUR OWN SOIL. SO PEOPLE WORKING IN OKLAHOMA CITY DO NOT HAVE THEIR HEADS CUT OFF BY A TERRORIST AT WORK. ALL OF THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON IT PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO LEAD WITH MORAL CLARITY. AND UNDERSTANDS THAT WE CANNOT BE A GREAT NATION, IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE, IF WE TRY TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM BEING A GOOD COUNTRY. A COUNTRY THAT IS ON ITS KNEES BEFORE AN ALMIGHTY, PROVIDENTIAL GOD. WITHOUT WHOSE HELP WE WOULD NOT BE GREAT. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THIS COUNTRY HAS NO WAY OF EXISTING WITHOUT THE ESTIMATION THAT GOD'S PROVIDENCE WAS INVOLVED IN HOW WE GOT HERE. I DO NOT THINK THIS COUNTRY IS DUMB. IF I DID, I WOULD GATHER MY GRANDCHILDREN AND WE WOULD HUDDLE UP AND GO TO DISNEY AND LIVE THE BEST LIFE WE COULD INTO IT ALL FELL APART. BUT I THINK IT IS WORTH THE FIGHT. AMERICA HAS BEEN REALLY, REALLY GOOD TO ME. PROBABLY LIKE IT HAS TO MANY OF YOU. I GREW UP DIRT POOR IN SOUTH ARKANSAS, THE SON OF A MAN WHO NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL. WHOSE DAD NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE HIM. I'M THE FIRST MALE TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL, MUCH LESS GO TO COLLEGE. MY FAMILY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF JUST POVERTY. MY DAD IS A TELL ME, DON'T LOOK VERY FAR OF THE FAMILY TREE. THERE IS STUFF YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE. THAT MADE ME CURIOUS, I REALIZED THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] BUT I AM BLESSED BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, I DID NOT HAVE TO STOP WHERE I STARTED. THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED TO ME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY MEANT THAT ONE DAY I COULD BECOME THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF MY STAY, EVEN THOUGH MY DAD WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. HE TOLD THE WHEN I WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO COME DOWN HERE AND DEDICATE A LAKE. HE IS GOING TO MAKE A TALL, I WILL TAKE YOU DOWN THERE TO HEAR THE TALK. YOU MAY LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND NEVER MEET A GOVERNOR. MY DAD CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT I WOULD EVER MEET THE GOVERNOR AGAIN, MUCH LESS BECOME ONE. WHY WOULD HE THINK THAT? WE LIVE IN AMERICA. WHERE THAT IS POSSIBLE. I WANT THAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MY GRANDKIDS, BUT I WANT FOR YOUR GRANDKIDS, TOO. AND FOR YOUR KIDS. AND IF WE CONTINUE ON THE PATH WE ARE ON, THAT WILL NOT BE THE CASE. AND THAT IS WHY I AM CONVINCED WE HAVE TO GET OUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL, WE HAVE TO GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK. AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT SO OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS WILL HAVE THE KIND OF AMERICA WE GREW UP TAKING FOR GRANTED. AND THAT IS WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I NEED YOUR SUPPORT IN THE CAUCUSES. I WANT TO REMIND YOU SOMETHING, YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THEM BEFORE HERE IN IOWA. I'M ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EASY, GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORTABLE HOMES ON A COLD FEBRUARY EVENING -- SNOW ALL OVER THE GROUND. CHANCES ARE IT WILL BE SNOWING THAT NIGHT, MAYBE SLEET AREA I WILL ASK YOU TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR AND SIT THERE FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS IN FRONT OF YOUR NEIGHBORS AND COWORKERS AND FOLKS YOU GO TO CHURCH WITH AND SAY, MIKE HUCKABEE FOR PRESIDENT. AND PERSUADE YOUR NEIGHBORS TO VOTE FOR ME WHEN YOU ARE THERE. AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP DO THAT, WE NEED YOU. WE NEED YOU TO MULTIPLY WITH YOUR FRIENDS, RELATIVES, THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH, AND NEIGHBORS. IF FOR SOME REASON, AND I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY, YOU THINK YOU MIGHT VOTE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE CAUCUSES, THEN I TELL YOU, IT IS GOING TO BE COLD THAT NIGHT. [LAUGHTER] YOU NEED TO STAY HOME WHERE IT IS WARM. PUT YOUR FEET UP, POP SOME POPCORN, WATCH IT ON TV. SAY, BOY, I SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN THERE. BUT FOR HEAVEN SAKES, IF YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE ELSE, DO NOT SHOW UP THAT NIGHT. [LAUGHTER] I WANT TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. WHO HAS ONE? YES, SIR. >> WHAT IS YOUR STANCE ON IMMIGRATION IN FEBRUARY CITIES? MIKE HUCKABEE: WE SHOULD HAVE THEM. THAT IS ONE GOVERNMENT AIDING AND ABETTING THE BREAKING OF THE LAW IN ANOTHER AREA OF GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE SEEN THE DISASTROUS IMPACT OF THAT IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE HAVE SEEN IT ELSEWHERE, BUT THAT WAS SO VIVID TO SEE THAT YOUNG, PRECIOUS GIRL COLD DOWN IN MY OWN DAUGHTER, SHE IS 32 YEARS OLD. I TELL YOU, THAT GOT CLOSE TO HOME. WE CAN'T FIX THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM WITHOUT HAVING CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS. I PLEDGE, WE WILL CONTROL OUR BORDERS AND WILL SECURE IT IN THE FIRST YEAR OF MY PRESIDENCY. FOUND SOUNDS A LITTLE AUDACIOUS, WE BUILT A 70 -- A 1700 MILE ROAD 73 YEARS AGO BECAME BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ALASKA. KEEP IN MIND, DEBTORS PRETTY TOUGH -- THAT IS PRETTY TOUGH CONDITIONS STOP. WE DID IN LESS THAN A YEAR. HE WAS A THERE IS JUST NO WAY TO SECURE THE BORDER, YES THERE IS IF YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DECIDE IT IS A PRIORITY. IF WE CAN BUILD 1700 MILES OF ROAD IN BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ALASKA, WE CAN SECURE THE BORDER. AND WE WILL. BUT WE CANNOT FIX ANYTHING WRONG WITH IMMIGRATION UNTIL THEN. THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST. YES? >> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT, AND WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO DO TO PROTECT ISRAEL FROM THE INEVITABLE -- IRAN WANTS TO BLOW THEM OFF THE MAP. MIKE HUCKABEE: I READ ALL 159 PAGES OF THE IRANIAN DEAL, I WAS REALLY DISGUSTED WHEN I HEARD THERE WAS A DEAL. I THOUGHT MAYBE IF I READ THIS I WILL FIND SOME COMFORT. I DIDN'T I THOUGHT MORE OUTRAGE. THIS WAS A COLOSSAL DISASTER OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. YOU MENTIONED ISRAEL, I FIRST WENT IN 1973. I HAVE BEEN THERE DOZENS OF TIMES. ONCE THIS YEAR, I AM GOING BACK NEXT MONTH. I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL VERY WELL, AND I WATCHED THIS NATION -- HERE'S WHAT I'VE SEEN, I'VE SEEN THE PROPHECY COME TRUE. THE DRY BONES HAVE COME TO LIFE. I HAVE SEEN THE DESERT BLOOM WITH MY OWN EYES. I WATCH THIS COUNTRY BECOME ONE OF THE POWERHOUSES OF THE WORLD. LIKE AMERICA, THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DESCRIBE WHAT ISRAEL IS ABOUT IS GOD'S INTERVENTION. I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THE OF DONE WITH THIS IRANIAN DEAL. WE EMPOWERED, AND EMBOLDENED TERRORISTS -- THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO, 36 YEARS AGO, TOOK OVER THE COUNTRY AND HELD AMERICANS HOSTAGE. THESE OF THE PEOPLES WERE NEVER KEPT A SINGLE BE A LIVE MADE. THEY CONNECT AMERICANS, MURDERED AMERICANS, CONSISTENTLY. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT SPONSORED HAMAS. THEY PAY FOR THE VERY ROCKETS FIRED FROM GAZA. I WAS THERE LAST AUGUST WHEN THOSE ROCKETS WERE BEING FIRED. I WAS AT THE SOUTHERNMOST AIRBASE. WHEN THE ISRAELIS WENT AND FLEW INTO GAZA AND SAW THIS ATTACK IN HER CARE THAT THEY TOOK TO TRY TO KEEP FROM HAVING CIVILIAN DEATHS. I ALSO SAW THE VIDEO IS WHERE HAMAS WOULD MOVE CIVILIANS IN FRONT OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THE TARGETS. THAT'S WHO WE AERE -- ARE DEALING WITH. THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED. THEIR PRESIDENT WAS SCREAMING DEATH TO AMERICA WHILE WE WERE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. I WANT TO REMIND AMERICANS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT ISRAEL. IRAN HAS REPEATEDLY SAID ISRAEL IS THE LITTLE SATAN, AMERICA IS THE GREAT SATAN. THEY DO NOT CHANT DEATH TO ISRAEL, IT WAS NOT THE PRIMARY TARGET, IT WAS THE WARM-UP ACT. WE ARE THE TARGET. WHY WOULD BE HELP LOAD A GUN THAT IS POINTED TO OUR OWN HEAD. ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD DO THAT. WHAT WE DID WAS NOTHING SHORT OF IDIOTIC. WE OUGHT TO REVERSE IT, BANKRUPT IRAN, OUGHT TO UTILIZE OUR OWN FORMS OF ENERGY TO BANKRUPT WHAT THEY'RE CAPACITY IS -- THEIR CAPACITY IS. WE HAVE ENERGY RIGHT UNDER OUR OWN FEET. WE COULD PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK AND GIVE THEM GOOD JOBS. WE COULD LOWER THE ENERGY COSTS FOR AMERICANS WHICH MEANS THAT SINGLE MOM DRIVING TO WORK EVERY DAY SHOULD BE PAYING ONE DOLLAR FOR GAS NOT FOUR DOLLARS. MAKE IT SO THAT THE 84 YEAR OLD WIDOW COULD TURN HER AIR-CONDITIONING ON RATHER THAN HAVE TO LEAVE IT OFF BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD ELECTRIC BILL. WE CAN BECOME THE NUMBER ONE EXPLOITER, AND EXPORTER, OF ENERGY. WE WOULD TAKE THE MARKETS AWAY FROM RUSSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, AND IRAN. WHEN WE DO THAT, WE NOT ONLY TRANSFORM OUR ECONOMY, WE ALSO RESET THE WHOLE BALANCE OF WORLD POWER, AND WE TAKE THE POWER OF PUTIN AWAY, WE TAKE THE POWER OF THE IRANIANS AWAY, AND WE TAKE THE POWER OF THE SAUDIS AWAY TO TRAIN TERRORISTS TO FLY BUILDINGS INTO -- PLANES INTO BUILDINGS ON 9/11. SOMEBODY ELSE? >> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OBAMACARE SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. BUT, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ALSO AGREE THAT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T ABLE TO AFFORD IT. MIKE HUCKABEE: THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THAT OBAMACARE DID NOT ADDRESS THE REAL PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AND AMERICA'S NOT A HEALTH CARE CRISIS. WE HAVE THE BEST HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD. DO YOU KNOW ANYONE THAT YOU HAD A DIAGNOSIS FROM THE DOCTOR DID ANYONE SAY QUICK, GIMME TO HAVANA, CUBA. EVER HEARD OF THAT? NEVER. EVER HEARD ANYONE SAY MY GOODNESS I NEED TO GET TO SHANGHAI AS QUICK AS I CAN? NO. I W -- YOU HEAR I WANT TO GET TO NEW ORLEANS. IT IS IN AMERICA. THE BEST HEALTH CARE IS HERE. WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT A HEALTH CARE CRISIS, IT IS A HEALTH CRISIS. 80% OF THE MONEY WE ARE SPENDING IN AMERICA IS TREATING CHRONIC DISEASES. WE VERY SICK POPULATION. THAT IS EXPENSIVE. INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING LET'S PUT MORE MONEY TO TREAT PEOPLE WHO LET ILLNESSES, LET'S PUT THE MONEY TO PREVENT THE ILLNESSES FROM EVER HAPPENING AND TO CURE THE ONES THAT ARE CURABLE. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A PRESIDENT NAMED HUCKABEE SAID IN THE NEXT DECADE WE WILL FIND A CURE TO CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, AND ALZHEIMER'S. HERE'S WHAT WE DECIDED, JUST LIKE WE ERADICATED POLIO, I WAS THERE. I MIGHT NOT BE 89, BUT I CAN REMEMBER THIS. I WERE MEMBER LINING UP THE COURTHOUSE LAWN AND GETTING MY POLIO VACCINE. I NEVER GOT POLIO BECAUSE OF THAT. KIDS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME HAD TO WEAR BRACES ON THEIR LEGS. I NEVER DID. WE DO NOT SPEND MONEY LAST YEAR ON POLIO, BECAUSE WE BEAT IT. WHAT IF WE DID THE SAME THING TO OUR DISEASE, DIABETES, CANCER, AND ALZHEIMER'S? DO YOU REALIZE THAT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE COULD SAVE? RIGHT NOW CANCER TREATMENT IS OVER 100 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ALZHEIMER'S WILL HE $1.1 TRILLION BY THE YEAR 2050. WE TRANSFER NOT JUST THE ECONOMY, BUT THEY CAN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE. WE WILL FIND CURES TO THESE DISEASES. MOST OF US HAVE GONE THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THOSE DISEASES IN OUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY. WE KNOW HOW DEVASTATING IT IS. ALL FOUR OF THOSE HAVE TOUCHED MY FAMILY. MY MOTHER, FATHER, WIFE, MOTHER-IN-LAW, IT HAS TOUCHED MTYY FAMILY, AND YOURS. IF WE PUT OUR FOCUS ON YOUR RATHER THAN ASK YOUR RATHER THAN INTERVENTION. THEY CAN BE COVERED, AND SHOULD BE. OBAMACARE HAS DONE EXACT THE OPPOSITE. IT SAID IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP HIM, AND IT WILL COST YOU LESS EVERY YEAR. I AM WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY I KEPT MY DOCTOR, MY HEALTH INSURANCE, AND IT IS CHEAPER. EVER THE OPPOSITE. I'VE LOST MY DOCTOR, LOST HEALTH INSURANCE, AND AS AN THEY CAN'T AFFORD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT IS COSTING THOUSANDS MORE. BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NOW MAKING DECISIONS NOT TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS BUT TO SHRINK THEIR BUSINESS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT A BUSINESS OWNER IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP HIS EMPLOYEES UNDER 50 BECAUSE HE CANNOT AFFORD TO GROW HIS BUSINESS. YES TO SHRINK HIS BUSINESS. -- HE HAS TO SHRINK HIS BUSINESS. WE SAY SERVE MORE CUSTOMERS, NOT CUT BACK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE GOVERNMENT MANDATES. AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD ABSOLUTELY GET DONE. THE QUICKEST WAY TO DO THAT JOB WISE TO THE FAIR TAX. THE GROUP'S WAY HEALTH CARE WISE IS TO PUT THE FOCUS ON PREVENTION RATHER THAN INTERVENTION. IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU, CHRIS. I THINK THE NEED THAT. I HOPE THAT IS JUST WATER. I WILL BE TALKING FUNNY SOON. THAT'S JUST WATER, YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THIS. [LAUGHTER] LET ME TAKE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. I WON'T WEAR YOU OUT YOU MAY HAVE THINGS TO DO. >> I HEARD THE DONALD TRUMP MADE SOME COMMENTS TODAY ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN, AND HE DID NOT PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT? MIKE HUCKABEE: UNFORTUNATELY, HE DID SAY SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT HE LIKES -- HE WAS BEING DISPARAGING TOWARDS MCCAIN AND SAID HE WASN'T A HERO BECAUSE HE GOT CAPTURED, AND THE PEOPLE THAT GOT CAPTURED WITH THE LOSERS. I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, JOHN MCCAIN WAS MY POLITICAL OPPONENT EIGHT YEARS AGO, I'M HAPPY TO SAY AND BEAT HIM IN THE STATE. BUT ULTIMATELY HE BEAT ME. I WAS NEVER PERSONALLY BITTER ABOUT THAT, THAT IS HOW POLITICS WORKS. I WENT ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND CAMPAIGN FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WAS OUR NOMINEE. ONE THING I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE JOHN MCCAIN, AND I HAVE MANY DISAGREEMENTS WITH HIM, BUT I WILL NEVER QUESTION THAT MAN SACRIFICE AND SERVICE TO THIS GREAT NATION. FOR SIX YEARS HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR AND WAS TORTURED MERCILESSLY BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE, BRUTALLY TORTURED. I READ THE ACCOUNT OF MCCAIN'S INCARCERATION AND TORTURE. IT IS JUST STUNNING. I DON'T THINK MOST OF US ARE MADE OF THE STUFF HE IS MADE OF, TO TAKE THAT KIND OF TORTURE FOR SIX SOLID YEARS. HE DID SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN CLAIM, THROUGH ALL OF THAT, HE RETURNED WITH HONOR. I DON'T CARE IF HE WERE THE MOST LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN THE WORLD, I WOULD SAY HE EARNED MY RESPECT. I CAN DISAGREE POLITICALLY, BUT I WILL NEVER DISRESPECT THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE, NOT ONLY THAT HE PUT FORTH, BUT THAT EVERY VETERAN PUT FORTH. FOLKS, I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, I GET TO WALK ON FREE LAND, AND BREATHE FREE AIR, BECAUSE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT A UNIFORM ON AND SACRIFICE TO KEEP ME FREE. WHETHER THEY SAW COMBAT, OR WERE POWS, THEY SERVED, I LIVE FREE. NOT ONLY AM I GRATEFUL, BUT IF THERE IS ONE THING IN THIS COUNTRY WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE DO, IT IS ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PROMISE THAT WE MAKE TO THOSE VETERANS WE KEEP TENFOLD. THEY KEPT THEIR PROMISES TO US. THAT IS NOT A MONEY ISSUE, NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE, IT IS A MORAL ISSUE. KEEP YOUR WORD. MAKE A PROMISE, KEEP IT. IF YOU CAN'T KEEP IT, DON'T MAKE IT. I FEEL THE SAME THING ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL CHANGE ALL THE RULES, AND TAKING HOLD ON, MANY HAVE BEEN PAYING THIS SINCE WE WERE 14 YEARS OLD. NOBODY ASKED ME IF THEY COULD TAKE THAT OUT OF MY CHECK. THEY TOOK IT OUT WHETHER I LIKED IT OR NOT, WITH THE CAVEAT THAT IF THEY TOOK IT OUT WHEN I GOT TO BE 65 SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WOULD BE THERE. I WILL NOT HOPEFULLY HAVE TO DEPEND SOCIAL -- SOLELY ON THAT. BUT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY, AND SOME OF THEM IT IS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE. ARE WE HONESTLY, SERIOUSLY, TAKING IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THEIR DUTY? THEY HAVE ACCEPTED HAVING THAT CONFISCATED FROM THEIR CHECKS? I DON'T THINK SO. GOD HELP US IF WE ARE THAT DISHONEST. ONE FINAL QUESTION. >> HOWE M -- HOW MUCH IS IT COST TO BE TREATED THERE? MIKE HUCKABEE: IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE BEING TREATED FOR. >> SAY COLON CANCER. MIKE HUCKABEE: I CAN'T GIVE YOU A FIGURE AT THE MAYO CLINIC. MY WIFE HAD SPINAL CANCER, IT SCARED THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF US. WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. IT COST MORE THAN WE MADE OVER SEVERAL YEARS. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY GET SICK. I HAVE NEVER SUGGESTED THAT IT IS OK TO SAY YOU JUST SET THE TOUGH IT OUT. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF COUNTRY AMERICA IS. I DON'T WANT TO SEE A STREET THIS MONSTROUS GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT IS ALL ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT TELLS YOU YOU HAVE TO DO, AND HAVE TO PAY FOR. IT IS ABOUT INSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, BUT MAKING SURE WHAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IS AFFORDABLE, AND PORTABLE, AND THAT HE GOES WITH YOU JUST LIKE YOUR CAR OR FORM INSURANCE -- HOME INSURANCE. IT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. IF I SET FIRE TO MY HOUSE, I DON'T GET TO CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY. IF I RUN MY CAR INTO A TREE CAN CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND SAY I WAS PRETENDING I WAS RICHARD PETTY. I HAVE TO SHOW SOME RESPONSIBILITY. IF I WANT TO LIVE HIS RECKLESS AS POSSIBLE, IT WILL COST MORE TO INSURE MY CAR IN MY HOME. IT WILL PROBABLY COST MORE TO INSURE MY BODY IF I'M RECKLESS WITH MY OWN HEALTH. THAT IS THE INSURANCE HAS TO WORK. IT CAN'T WORK WHERE WE LET SOMEBODY ELSE PAY FOR OUR IRRESPONSIBILITY. >> AT THIS POINT, THE AVERAGE PERSON CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO THOSE FANCY CLINICS. MIKE HUCKABEE: AND YOU MAY NOT NEED TO. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE MAYO CLINIC, MYSELF. I GO TO THE LOCAL FACILITY WHERE I LIVE. I DID NOT MEAN THE MAYO CLINIC WAS THE ONLY PLACE, IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE PLACES. TEHRE SH -- THERE SHOULD BE A MEANS TO ACCESS THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THAT IS SOMETHING WE DID NOT WORK ON WITH OBAMACARE. WHAT WE WORKED HIM AS MAKING SURE THAT WE FORCE PEOPLE BY GOVERNMENT EDICT TO BUY A LEVEL OF INSURANCE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED, AND IT NOT WANT. BECAUSE OF OBAMA CARE MANDATES THE COVERAGES, I'M A 59-YEAR-OLD MALE, I HAVE MATERNITY COVERAGE. [LAUGHTER] IT IS MANDATED. I'M NOT SURE YOU LAUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING HOW RIDICULOUS. I AM PRETTY SURE I AM BN -- NOT GOING TO GET PREGNANT. AND IF I DO, I WILL GET A REALITY SHOW IN MAY SO MUCH MONEY ABLE NEED INSURANCE. THIS WILL BE HUGE. BUT I HAVE TO HAVE MATERNITY BENEFITS. I ALSO NEED BENEFITS FOR DRUG COUNSELING, I CANNOT A DRUG ADDICT -- AM NOT A DRUG ADDICT. I HAVE NEVER TASTED BEER, I HAVEN'T. I DON'T DRINK. AS A TEENAGER, AND A SMELLED IT, AND IT SMELLED AWFUL. MY FRIEND SAID WELL YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP A TASTE FOR IT. I MAY BE CRAZY ON SOME THINGS BEHIND EVERY RATIONAL AND SAID TO LET ME SEE IF I GET THIS RIGHT -- I HAVE TO DEVELOP A TASTE? WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF I GO AND CONTINUE TO TAKE SOMETHING INTO MY MOUTH THAT I FIND REPULSIVE THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO ACCEPT IT, THEN LIKE IT. I SAID THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. WHY WOULD I BEAT MY BODY INTO SUBMISSION TO ACCEPT SOMETHING? I AM NOT AT RISK FOR GETTING ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL, BUT I HAVE TO PAY FOR COVERAGE BECAUSE IT SOMEONE ELSE WANTS IT, I AM SUBSIDIZING THAT. SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT? I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T THINK SO. FOLKS, YOU HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HOPE I ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE UNDERMINED, AND HEART. MEMBER, FEBRUARY, WHERE WILL YOU BE? IN CAUCUS? WHO WILL YOU VOTE FOR? [LAUGHTER] IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR HUCKABEE, WHAT WILL YOU DO? STAY HOME. WE'VE GOT IT FOLKS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANKS FOR HOSTING THE EVENT. THANK YOU GUYS. THANKS FOR COMING OUT. [INDISCERNIBLE] [LAUGHTER] >> MY MOTHER IS A PASTOR. >> WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE SHE LOOKED ME RIGHT IN THE EYES. MY MOM SAID THAT. >> I SAID YES, MA'AM. MIKE HUCKABEE: HOW ARE YOU GUYS? HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL, I REALIZED THAT. HI, THERE. HOW ARE YOU DOING? WHAT I AM THINKING IS, YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH PEPPERONI. [INDISCERNIBLE] >> NO, HE IS AN ILLINOIS. MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT IS QUITE A DRIVE, ISN'T IT? DID YOU GET OUT THERE? >> NO. [INDISCERNIBLE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I AM GLAD YOU ALL CAME OUT HERE. >> I VOTED FOR YOU THE LAST TIME AROUND. YOU ARE ON MY BUCKET LIST TO MEET. MIKE HUCKABEE: GET THE CAMERA THERE, THEY WILL TAKE IT FOR US. THANK YOU. > IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU. . MIKE HUCKABEE: HERE WE GO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYER THIS AFTERNOON. >> YOU ARE WELCOME. MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT IS IMMANUEL IS NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS PHOTOGRAPHY. >> WHEN SOMEONE ASKS ME TO SMILE , I SAY I CAN'T. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS. YOU DID ALL THAT WITHOUT A TELEPROMPTER? MIKE HUCKABEE: THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE. >> COULD I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH? MIKE HUCKABEE: SURE. MY FATHER RAISE ME TO BELIEVE IF YOU TELL THE TRUTH YOU DON'T NOT REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID. I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE. >> 2017. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT VP, BUT -- MIKE HUCKABEE: I HAVE TO GET THE FIRST SLOT FIRST. >> I AM PLUGGING FOR BOTH OF YOU. MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT IS NOT A BAD IDEA. THANK YOU. YOU MUST LIKE TO HUNT. >> I AM A STORM CHASER FOR THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE DRIVING BY. MIKE HUCKABEE: DO YOU LIVE HERE IN IOWA? >> I WAS IN DES MOINES. MIKE HUCKABEE: HOW LONG IF YOU BEEN CHASING STORMS? >> SINCE I WAS 16. MIKE HUCKABEE: WE HAD SOME BAD TORNADOES. I WAS IN TWO PERSONALLY. TERRIBLE STUFF. >> I AM GLAD YOU'RE RUNNING. YOU ARE THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT.

HE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON IMMIGRATION, HEALTH CARE, AND RECENT COMMENTS BY FELLOW GOP CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS ABOUT AN HOUR. MYMIKE HUCKABEE: GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TOO FAR TO DRIVE? I'M GLAD YOU CAME TODAY. I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS TIME. NICE TO MEET YOU. WE HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME, WE PROBABLY KNOW EACH OTHER. HOW ARE YOU? I AM TIRED. >> I WONDER WHY? MIKE HUCKABEE: I WOKE UP EARLY. REVIEW AT THE EVENT? WE MET BRIEFLY. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? HOW ARE YOU, SIR? >> MIKE HUCKABEE, NICE TO SEE YOU. MYMIKE HUCKABEE: I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. I CANNOT IMAGINE. JUST OUR LUCK THAT THE ONE GUY ON THE SHOW WAS A CONSERVATIVE CLOWN. [LAUGHTER] [INDISCERNIBLE] MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT JUST PROVES I'M SPEAKING TO AN INTELLIGENT GROUP. THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR. WE JUST GOT BACK FROM AMES, DOING THE FAMILY LEADERS OF EVENT. IT WENT WELL. A BIG CROWD. YOU WERE THERE? THANK YOU. THAT IS A GREAT PLACE. WELL, IT IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY. >> HE ASKED ME TO INTRODUCE HIM. I WOULD INVITE THE PASTOR FROM THE MONROE METHODIST CHURCH FOR THE PRAYER. >> I AM USUALLY NOT THE ONE, I HAVE TO WRITE MY HEART DOWN ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER TO SAY WHAT IS ON MY HEART AND ON THE HEARTS OF ALL I THINK WHO LIVE IN THIS GREAT NATION. LET US PRAY. OH MYIGHTY GOD, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE, WISDOM, AND LOVE. WE THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED IN OUR MILITARY TO A SURE OUR FREEDOM THAT ALLOWS US TO MEET THIS DAY FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. OUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY FOR THE UNNECESSARY DEATHS OF THE MARINES IN OUR BORDERS. WE REACH OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF THESE BRAVE MAN WHO SELFLESSLY SERVED OUR COUNTRY. AND WE ASK THAT YOU HOLD THEM WITH YOUR LOVE. SOMETIMES, WE FORGET HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE THE FREEDOM TO OPENLY CONGREGATE AND SHARE OUR THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS. LORD, MANY OF US FEEL OUR NATION MAY BE HEADED DOWN A PATH OF DANGER AND IMMORALITY -- WHERE OUR CONSTITUTION IS NOT BEING ADHERED TO IN A WAY THAT IS ALWAYS GUIDED THIS NATION. THE THREATS OF TERRORISM, VIOLENCE, TYRANNY, UNREST IN OUR BORDERS, WE NEED TO EVEN MORE. GOD, HELP US TO FOLLOW YOUR LAWS BEFORE HUMANITY. AND GIVE US THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS IN CONTROL. WE GATHER HERE TODAY WITH GOVERNOR HUCKABEE AS HE MAKES A BID TO BECOME OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BY THIS BE A TIME WHERE WE EXPRESS AND SHARE OUR THOUGHTS. WE PRAY THAT HIS WISDOM, LEADERSHIP SKILLS, PASSION FOR OTHERS, AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU WILL GUIDE THIS GREAT NATION IN THE DIRECTION OF PEACE, ASPERITY, UNITY, AND PATRIOTISM. HELP US CONTINUE TO BE THE GREAT NATION FOUNDED BY YOU, GOD. AND BLESS THIS TIME WE SHARE TOGETHER WITH GOVERNOR HUCKABEE. IN JESUS' NAME WE PRAY, AMEN. >> STAND AND JOIN IN THE PLEDGE WITH ME. >> I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. >> THANK YOU. >> IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE OUR GUEST HERE TODAY, THE GOVERNOR -- HE WAS THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. THE GOVERNOR FOR 11 YEARS, THE LONGEST-SERVING GOVERNOR IN HISTORY OF THAT STATE. I TELL YOU, THE FIRST TIME I MET THE GOVERNOR WAS WHEN HE WAS COMING THROUGH HERE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. AND WE WERE AT THE STRAW POLL IN AMES. AND HE WAS ON STAGE PLAYING HIS GUITAR. I MISSED SEEING YOU ON THE SATURDAY EVENINGS, TOO. I ENJOYED THAT. GOVERNOR HUCKABEE: I MISS THAT. >> THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN AN AVID MUSICIAN SINCE HE WAS 11. [LAUGHTER] GOVERNOR HUCKABEE: I WILL NEED HELP GETTING UP. >> THEY TELL ME HERE HE IS 69. [APPLAUSE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT WAY. 89. YES SIR. I WAS A SCHOOL SPEAKING SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I DID A LOT OF SPEAKING AT SCHOOLS. I WENT TO A CAMPUS AND TALK TO KIDS. FIRST OF ALL, THEY ARE SO HONEST. THEY JUST LET YOU HAVE IT. AND I WAS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND SO, THE KIDS WERE OUT THERE KIND OF RESTLESS. I GOT UP AND SAID, OK, BY THE WAY, HOW OLD ARE YOU GUYS? YOU ARE ABOUT NINE YEARS OLD? THAT IS ABOUT HOW OLD MOST WERE. I SAID, HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM? AND ONE KID SAID 76? I SAID KID, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO GET OUT THE THIRD GRADE. [LAUGHTER] SOME THINGS THE GOVERNOR CANNOT DO, THAT IS SOMETHING I CAN MAKE HAPPEN. EXPEL THAT CHILD, DON'T LET THEM HAVE A SEAT. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING OUT AND 4:30 ON A SATURDAY. IT IS A TOUGH TIME, WE JUST GOT BACK FROM AMES, AND 3000 OF YOUR FELLOW IOWANS WERE THERE AT THE FAMILY LEADER CONFERENCE. IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT GIVE US THE CONFIDENCE TO HAVE A KIND OF INTIMACY WHERE WE CAN VISIT. AND I WILL DO SOMETHING THAT HILLARY WILL NOT DO. I WILL ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY. I AM NOT GOING TO PUT THE PRESS INSIDE OF A ROPE. I THINK THAT IS A PRESS. LUS. I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOU BEING HERE TODAY. EIGHT YEARS AGO, WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT, I CAME TO PLACES LIKE THIS IN IOWA. THE TRUTH IS, WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT, I HAD FEWER PEOPLE THAN ON THIS FIRST ROW RIGHT HERE. AND IT WAS JUST INCH BY INCH, LITTLE BY LITTLE WE KEPT BUILDING A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WERE WILLING TO SUPPORT ME. AND WHEN WE WON THE IOWA CAUCUSES IN 2008, WE ENDED UP HAVING THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CAUCUS VOTERS FOR ME THAT HAVE EVER VOTED FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET IN THE HISTORY OF THE IOWA CAUCUS. THE GOOD NEWS IS, THAT IS A WONDERFUL MILESTONE. BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I THINK FOR ONE MINUTE THAT I CAN JUST SHOW UP A FEW TIMES IN IOWA AND SAY, WELL YOU VOTED FOR ME BEFORE? I EXPECT YOU TO DO IT AGAIN. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. BUT I HAVE NO EXPECTATION THAT THERE IS ANY OBLIGATION PEOPLE WOULD DO IT AGAIN. I HAVE TO EARN IT, THIS LIKE LAST TIME. I HOPE I CAN DO THAT. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY. AND IF I DID NOT THINK THAT, BELIEVE ME, I WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE WONDERFULLY PLEASANT JOB AND I'VE HAD FOR THE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS. OVER THE PAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY, I HAVE BEEN A CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE. AND I CAN SAY TO YOU THAT IS HARD WORK. WE GET MUSIC. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS EXCELLENT COMING FROM ANOTHER ROOM. THAT IS NOT IN HERE. AND THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO? IT IS IN THE SPEAKER'S NEXT DOOR. SO LET ME PICK UP BACK HERE. RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS REALLY HARD WORK. THEN I GOT ELECTED HIM LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THEN GOVERNOR. THAT IS EVEN HARDER WORK. IT IS A CHALLENGE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GOVERN IN A STATE LIKE ARKANSAS WHERE IT WAS THE MOST PARTISAN STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND I KNOW THAT MAY BE A SURPRISE TO YOU, BUT ARKANSAS IS MORE PARTISAN -- WE HAD MORE LOPSIDED POLITICAL STRUCTURE THE MASSACHUSETTS DID, VERMONT, MAINE, OREGON, CALIFORNIA. ANY STATE -- THE MOST IN THE COUNTRY. AND SERVING AS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AFTER THREE YEARS, GOVERNOR FOR 10 HALF YEARS, I CAN TELL YOU THAT WAS HARD. THE LAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS, I HOSTED A TALK SHOW ON TELEVISION. I HAVE DONE RADIO TALK, BOTH COMMENTARY AND A TALK SHOW. I DRIVE AROUND MAKING SPEECHES. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. TALKING ABOUT THE CANDIDATES AND OFFICEHOLDERS, THAT IS THE EASIEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD MY LIFE. [LAUGHTER] AND IT PAID BETTER MONEY THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE. I GOT AMUSED WHEN SOME REPORTERS WROTE THAT HUCKABEE IS NOT SERIOUS. HE IS JUST TRYING TO BUILD HIS PROFILE SO WE CAN GET A TV SHOW, SELL SOME BOOKS, MAKES AND SPEECHES. I AM THINKING, WHAT IDIOT WROTE THAT? I HAD A TELEVISION SHOW, I HAVE WRITTEN 12 BOOKS, I HAVE MORE SPEECHES THAN I CAN ACCEPT. THAT IS WHAT I WALKED AWAY FROM TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THE ONLY REASON I WOULD DO THAT IS BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY IS IN REAL TROUBLE. SOMETHING I HAD THAT I DID NOT HAVE A YEARS AGO, FIVE GRANDKIDS. BY THE WAY, ALL FIVE OF THEM ARE FOUR AND UNDER. [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THEM IS LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS OLD, THE LITTLE BOY GEORGE. AND THE OLDEST ONE JUST TURNED FOUR ON THE SECOND OF THIS MONTH. IMAGINE HOW LOUD THINGS ARE WHEN THEY'LL GET TOGETHER? [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE MY GRANDKIDS. IT OR RUNNING BECAUSE I WANT TO SAY THE NATION FOR THEM OR I AM RUNNING BECAUSE THAT WAY I DO NOT HAVE TO HEAR HOW LOUD THEY CAN BE WHEN THEY ARE ALTOGETHER. [LAUGHTER] I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE REASON ANYBODY WOULD DO THIS HAS TO BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN EGO. I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS TOO LONG TO LET YOU GO BE THE REASON I RAN A CAMPAIGN. THE GLORY OF BEING A POLITICAL CANDADIDATE DISAPPEARS AFTER 15 MINUTES. NOTHING IS BETTER THAN BEING ON TV. PEOPLE LOVE YOU. YOU RUN FOR OFFICE, BEFORE HATE YOU. AND THAT IS YOUR OWN FAMILY. [LAUGHTER] LET ME SAY VERY HONESTLY, I AM BLESSED. MY WIFE WAS A LITTLE UPSET WITH ME FOR NOT RUNNING FOUR YEARS AGO. NOBODY IS A STRONGER SUPPORTER AND A MORE COMMITTED PARTICIPANT IN THIS PROCESS THAN SHE IS. AND FRANKLY, I WOULD NOT BE DOING IT IF I DID NOT HAVE HER WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT. THIS IS HARD TO DO. WHEN YOUR FAMILY IS WITH YOU, I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. IF YOUR FAMILY IS NOT WITH YOU. FRANKLY, A DIVIDED FAMILY IS SOMETHING NONE OF US IN AFFORD TO HAVE. BUT WE HAVE A DIVIDED COUNTRY. A SEVERELY DIVIDED COUNTRY. AND WE ARE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF IT, THE EFFECTS OF IT ECONOMICALLY. I AM IN A TOWN WHERE ONCE MANY MANY PEOPLE WOULD GO TO WORK AT THE MAYTAG PLANT IN NEWTON, IOWA. IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE KNEW IT WAS HERE. I DID NOT LIVE HERE, I LIVED IN ARKANSAS, I DO YOU HAD A MAYTAG PLANT. I REMEMBER WHEN WHIRLPOOL BOUGHT MAYTAG, THERE WAS A BIG PLANT IN MY STATE OF ARKANSAS. I REMOVE OR WHEN THIS PLANT CLOSED, I REMOVE OR WHEN THE WHIRLPOOL PLANT CLOSED. I REMOVE OR WHEN THE ARKANSAS PLANT CLOSE. WE LOST ALL THE JOBS TO MEXICO. A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW, PERHAPS SOME OF YOU FOR ALL I KNOW MAY HAVE ONCE WORKED THERE AND LOST JOBS. I'M TIRED OF SEEING AMERICA LOSE JOBS. I'M TIRED OF SEEING AMERICANS WORK YEAR AFTER YEAR REALLY HARD AT SOMETHING ONLY TO FIND ONE DAY THEY WALK IN AND THEY'RE TOLD THE JOB IS GONE. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TELLING EVERYBODY THE ECONOMY IS IN RECOVERY. I DON'T TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND PLACES LIKE THIS WERE PEOPLE SAY YES, THE ECONOMY IS JUST DOING SWIMMINGLY WELL. PEOPLE TELL ME QUITE THE OPPOSITE. THE ECONOMY IS NOT RECOVERING FOR MANY WORKING AMERICANS. IF ANYTHING, IT STRUGGLES BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD A GOOD JOB A FEW YEARS AGO THAT PAID BENEFITS AND EVEN A PENSION. TODAY, THEY ARE WORKING TWO AND THREE PART-TIME JOBS -- NO PENSION OR BENEFITS. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I WAS IN AIKEN, SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WERE SPENDING A DAY THERE AT THE FAIRFIELD INN. A NICE LITTLE HOTEL, AND LETS YOU HAVE FREE INTERNET AND FREE BREAKFAST. WE ARE CHEAP, WE HAVE TO BE. [LAUGHTER] I GOT DOWN THERE WHEN THEY OPEN FOR BREAKFAST AT 6:00, I WAS ONLY ONE DOWN THERE EXCEPT THE GUY WORKING. HE WAS TAKING CARE OF THE TABLES FOR PEOPLE COMING DOWN TO HAVE BREAKFAST. BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY ONE DOWN THERE, WE STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION. HIS NAME IS MARK, HE IS IN HIS 50'S -- THEY BE A FEW YEARS UNDER THE ME. AND THESE OLD LADIES. [LAUGHTER] JUST SEEING IF YOU WERE LISTENING. WE GOT TO TALKING, UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO, HE WAS ONE OF 300 PEOPLE THAT WORK AT A MANUFACTURING PLANT THERE IN AIKEN. THEY CLOSE THE PLANT, ALL 300 LOST THEIR JOBS. HE WAS A COLLEGE EDUCATED ACCOUNTANT FOR THE COMPANY. BUT THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY CLOSED DOWN, HIS JOB WENT AWAY. THIS MAN HAD A GOOD DEGREE, GOOD JOB, WORKING FOR 20 SOMETHING YEARS, NOW FOUND THAT HE HAD NO JOB. HE WAS WORKING THREE PART-TIME JOBS. ONE OF WHICH WAS TO GET UP AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING AND GO DOWN TO THE FAIRFIELD INN AND SERVE BREAKFAST TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL. HE WOULD GO TO TWO MORE JOBS AFTER THAT. AND HE DID THAT BECAUSE HIS HOUSE IS ALMOST PAID OFF. HE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE IT. HE CAN AFFORD TO MOVE ANYWHERE. HE CANNOT FIND ANOTHER JOB ANYWHERE. AND THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT I SEE HAPPENING ALL AROUND US. THAT IS THE AMERICA WE NEED TO FIX. AND WE ALSO NEED TO FIX AN AMERICA WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER NOT JUST THEY GO TO THE MIDDLE EAST, THEY'RE IN DANGER STANDING OUTSIDE AN ARMY RESERVE RECRUITING STATION OR MARINE RESERVE RECRUITING STATION OR A MARINE AND NAVAL RESERVE UNIT. THAT HAPPENED IN MY HOME STATE OF ARKANSAS. A YOUNG MAN, PRIVATE FIRST CLASS STANDING OUT FRONT OF THE RECRUITING STATION WAS ASSIGNED THERE. YET GONE THROUGH TRAINING. HE WAS SITTING OUTSIDE AS A RECRUITER. A YOUNG, RADICALIZED ISLAMIC JIHADIST FROM MEMPHIS WHO GREW UP A BAPTIST IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD BY THE NAME OF WHAT WAS CARLOS BLEDSOE, WENT TO YEMEN AND CAME BACK. HIS FATHER CALL THE FBI AND SAID I THINK MY SON IS INTO SOMETHING BAD. THE FBI DID NOT TAKE IT SERIOUS ENOUGH. HE HAD SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO DO SOME HORRIBLE THINGS. IT WAS PRETTY BAD AT BEING A TERRORIST. HIS ATTEMPTS FAILED, ONE OF THE THINGS HE WANTED TO DO WAS BLOW UP TIME SQUARE. THAT DID NOT WORK. HE NEVER GOT CAUGHT. BUT ONE DAY HE DROVE OVER FROM MEMPHIS, ABOUT TWO AND HALF HOUR DRIVE TO LITTLE ROCK, TO THE RIFLE AND HELD OUTSIDE OF HIS CAR AND FIRED SHOTS THAT KILLED IN THE LONG AND VERY SEVERELY WOUNDED ANOTHER ARMY SOLDIER. STANDING IN FRONT OF THE ARMY RECRUITING STATION, IN A STRIP'S SHOPPING CENTER IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS. WHEN THIS HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY, WHEN THE SHOOTER WENT ON HIS RAMPAGE AND SHOT UP THE FRONT OF A RECRUITING STATION IN A STRIP SHOPPING CENTER, MY FIRST REACTION WAS -- I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE. IT DOES NOT END WELL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MOST DISTRESSING WAS THESE ARE THE MOST TRAINED, CAPABLE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO HANDLE WEAPONS. BUT WHEN THEY HAVE DUTIES LIKE THAT, YOU MAKE THEM PUT THEIR WEAPONS ASIDE. THEY ARE SITTING DUCKS FOR THE TERRORISTS. DAY ONE, WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WILL BE NOTIFIED THAT MILITARY MEMBERS WILL BE FREE TO CARRY THE WEAPONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE TRAINED. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DISARM OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, ARRANGED, COAST GUARD AND HAVE THEM WALKING AS VULNERABLE SITTING DUCKS SO THAT SAVAGES WILL MURDER THEM IN COLD BLOOD ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA. THAT MUST STOP NOW. PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT DO I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE TO FIX IN AMERICA? THE ECONOMY? OR IS IT NATIONAL SECURITY? I TELL PEOPLE THAT IS LIKE ASKING ME WHICH WING ON THE AIRPLANE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT -- LEFT OR RIGHT? WHEN I FLY, FOLKS, I WANT BOTH WINGS ATTACHED. THE PLANE LIFE BETTER. THE PLANE NEEDS A STEERING MECHANISM. AND NEEDS TO HAVE FLAPS AND A RUTTER, OR ECONOMIC STEERED. WINGS WITHOUT A STEERING MECHANISM STILL ENDS IN A CRASH. AMERICA HAS TO HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY, AND A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT AMERICA HAS TO HAVE. IT HAS TO HAVE A STRONG MORAL FOUNDATION TO STEER THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT MORALITY, WITHOUT A CLEAR UNAPOLOGETIC COMMITMENT TO THE MORAL ABSOLUTES OF THINGS BEING RIGHT OR WRONG, WE DO NOT HAVE A STEERING MECHANISM. AND THIS COUNTRY STILL CRASHES. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT SAYING WE MUST GET THE ECONOMY BACK IN SHAPE. YES, WE DO. AND THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THE FAIR TAX WHICH WOULD END ALL THE TAXES ON WORK, SAVINGS, INVESTMENTS. WE WOULD PAY TAXES AT THE POINT OF CONSUMPTION. WE WITH THE JOBS COME BACK TO THE COUNTRY, CAPITAL COME BACK -- PEOPLE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE AND MAKE THINGS AGAIN. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT PROTECTING AMERICANS OVERSEAS AND HERE ON OUR OWN SOIL. SO PEOPLE WORKING IN OKLAHOMA CITY DO NOT HAVE THEIR HEADS CUT OFF BY A TERRORIST AT WORK. ALL OF THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON IT PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO LEAD WITH MORAL CLARITY. AND UNDERSTANDS THAT WE CANNOT BE A GREAT NATION, IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE, IF WE TRY TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM BEING A GOOD COUNTRY. A COUNTRY THAT IS ON ITS KNEES BEFORE AN ALMIGHTY, PROVIDENTIAL GOD. WITHOUT WHOSE HELP WE WOULD NOT BE GREAT. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THIS COUNTRY HAS NO WAY OF EXISTING WITHOUT THE ESTIMATION THAT GOD'S PROVIDENCE WAS INVOLVED IN HOW WE GOT HERE. I DO NOT THINK THIS COUNTRY IS DUMB. IF I DID, I WOULD GATHER MY GRANDCHILDREN AND WE WOULD HUDDLE UP AND GO TO DISNEY AND LIVE THE BEST LIFE WE COULD INTO IT ALL FELL APART. BUT I THINK IT IS WORTH THE FIGHT. AMERICA HAS BEEN REALLY, REALLY GOOD TO ME. PROBABLY LIKE IT HAS TO MANY OF YOU. I GREW UP DIRT POOR IN SOUTH ARKANSAS, THE SON OF A MAN WHO NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL. WHOSE DAD NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE HIM. I'M THE FIRST MALE TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL, MUCH LESS GO TO COLLEGE. MY FAMILY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF JUST POVERTY. MY DAD IS A TELL ME, DON'T LOOK VERY FAR OF THE FAMILY TREE. THERE IS STUFF YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE. THAT MADE ME CURIOUS, I REALIZED THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] BUT I AM BLESSED BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, I DID NOT HAVE TO STOP WHERE I STARTED. THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED TO ME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY MEANT THAT ONE DAY I COULD BECOME THE 44TH GOVERNOR OF MY STAY, EVEN THOUGH MY DAD WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. HE TOLD THE WHEN I WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO COME DOWN HERE AND DEDICATE A LAKE. HE IS GOING TO MAKE A TALL, I WILL TAKE YOU DOWN THERE TO HEAR THE TALK. YOU MAY LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND NEVER MEET A GOVERNOR. MY DAD CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT I WOULD EVER MEET THE GOVERNOR AGAIN, MUCH LESS BECOME ONE. WHY WOULD HE THINK THAT? WE LIVE IN AMERICA. WHERE THAT IS POSSIBLE. I WANT THAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MY GRANDKIDS, BUT I WANT FOR YOUR GRANDKIDS, TOO. AND FOR YOUR KIDS. AND IF WE CONTINUE ON THE PATH WE ARE ON, THAT WILL NOT BE THE CASE. AND THAT IS WHY I AM CONVINCED WE HAVE TO GET OUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL, WE HAVE TO GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK. AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT SO OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS WILL HAVE THE KIND OF AMERICA WE GREW UP TAKING FOR GRANTED. AND THAT IS WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I NEED YOUR SUPPORT IN THE CAUCUSES. I WANT TO REMIND YOU SOMETHING, YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THEM BEFORE HERE IN IOWA. I'M ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EASY, GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORTABLE HOMES ON A COLD FEBRUARY EVENING -- SNOW ALL OVER THE GROUND. CHANCES ARE IT WILL BE SNOWING THAT NIGHT, MAYBE SLEET AREA I WILL ASK YOU TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR AND SIT THERE FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS IN FRONT OF YOUR NEIGHBORS AND COWORKERS AND FOLKS YOU GO TO CHURCH WITH AND SAY, MIKE HUCKABEE FOR PRESIDENT. AND PERSUADE YOUR NEIGHBORS TO VOTE FOR ME WHEN YOU ARE THERE. AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP DO THAT, WE NEED YOU. WE NEED YOU TO MULTIPLY WITH YOUR FRIENDS, RELATIVES, THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH, AND NEIGHBORS. IF FOR SOME REASON, AND I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY, YOU THINK YOU MIGHT VOTE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE CAUCUSES, THEN I TELL YOU, IT IS GOING TO BE COLD THAT NIGHT. [LAUGHTER] YOU NEED TO STAY HOME WHERE IT IS WARM. PUT YOUR FEET UP, POP SOME POPCORN, WATCH IT ON TV. SAY, BOY, I SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN THERE. BUT FOR HEAVEN SAKES, IF YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE ELSE, DO NOT SHOW UP THAT NIGHT. [LAUGHTER] I WANT TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. WHO HAS ONE? YES, SIR. >> WHAT IS YOUR STANCE ON IMMIGRATION IN FEBRUARY CITIES? MIKE HUCKABEE: WE SHOULD HAVE THEM. THAT IS ONE GOVERNMENT AIDING AND ABETTING THE BREAKING OF THE LAW IN ANOTHER AREA OF GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE SEEN THE DISASTROUS IMPACT OF THAT IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE HAVE SEEN IT ELSEWHERE, BUT THAT WAS SO VIVID TO SEE THAT YOUNG, PRECIOUS GIRL COLD DOWN IN MY OWN DAUGHTER, SHE IS 32 YEARS OLD. I TELL YOU, THAT GOT CLOSE TO HOME. WE CAN'T FIX THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM WITHOUT HAVING CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS. I PLEDGE, WE WILL CONTROL OUR BORDERS AND WILL SECURE IT IN THE FIRST YEAR OF MY PRESIDENCY. FOUND SOUNDS A LITTLE AUDACIOUS, WE BUILT A 70 -- A 1700 MILE ROAD 73 YEARS AGO BECAME BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ALASKA. KEEP IN MIND, DEBTORS PRETTY TOUGH -- THAT IS PRETTY TOUGH CONDITIONS STOP. WE DID IN LESS THAN A YEAR. HE WAS A THERE IS JUST NO WAY TO SECURE THE BORDER, YES THERE IS IF YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DECIDE IT IS A PRIORITY. IF WE CAN BUILD 1700 MILES OF ROAD IN BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ALASKA, WE CAN SECURE THE BORDER. AND WE WILL. BUT WE CANNOT FIX ANYTHING WRONG WITH IMMIGRATION UNTIL THEN. THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST. YES? >> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT, AND WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO DO TO PROTECT ISRAEL FROM THE INEVITABLE -- IRAN WANTS TO BLOW THEM OFF THE MAP. MIKE HUCKABEE: I READ ALL 159 PAGES OF THE IRANIAN DEAL, I WAS REALLY DISGUSTED WHEN I HEARD THERE WAS A DEAL. I THOUGHT MAYBE IF I READ THIS I WILL FIND SOME COMFORT. I DIDN'T I THOUGHT MORE OUTRAGE. THIS WAS A COLOSSAL DISASTER OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. YOU MENTIONED ISRAEL, I FIRST WENT IN 1973. I HAVE BEEN THERE DOZENS OF TIMES. ONCE THIS YEAR, I AM GOING BACK NEXT MONTH. I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL VERY WELL, AND I WATCHED THIS NATION -- HERE'S WHAT I'VE SEEN, I'VE SEEN THE PROPHECY COME TRUE. THE DRY BONES HAVE COME TO LIFE. I HAVE SEEN THE DESERT BLOOM WITH MY OWN EYES. I WATCH THIS COUNTRY BECOME ONE OF THE POWERHOUSES OF THE WORLD. LIKE AMERICA, THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DESCRIBE WHAT ISRAEL IS ABOUT IS GOD'S INTERVENTION. I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THE OF DONE WITH THIS IRANIAN DEAL. WE EMPOWERED, AND EMBOLDENED TERRORISTS -- THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO, 36 YEARS AGO, TOOK OVER THE COUNTRY AND HELD AMERICANS HOSTAGE. THESE OF THE PEOPLES WERE NEVER KEPT A SINGLE BE A LIVE MADE. THEY CONNECT AMERICANS, MURDERED AMERICANS, CONSISTENTLY. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT SPONSORED HAMAS. THEY PAY FOR THE VERY ROCKETS FIRED FROM GAZA. I WAS THERE LAST AUGUST WHEN THOSE ROCKETS WERE BEING FIRED. I WAS AT THE SOUTHERNMOST AIRBASE. WHEN THE ISRAELIS WENT AND FLEW INTO GAZA AND SAW THIS ATTACK IN HER CARE THAT THEY TOOK TO TRY TO KEEP FROM HAVING CIVILIAN DEATHS. I ALSO SAW THE VIDEO IS WHERE HAMAS WOULD MOVE CIVILIANS IN FRONT OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THE TARGETS. THAT'S WHO WE AERE -- ARE DEALING WITH. THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED. THEIR PRESIDENT WAS SCREAMING DEATH TO AMERICA WHILE WE WERE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. I WANT TO REMIND AMERICANS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT ISRAEL. IRAN HAS REPEATEDLY SAID ISRAEL IS THE LITTLE SATAN, AMERICA IS THE GREAT SATAN. THEY DO NOT CHANT DEATH TO ISRAEL, IT WAS NOT THE PRIMARY TARGET, IT WAS THE WARM-UP ACT. WE ARE THE TARGET. WHY WOULD BE HELP LOAD A GUN THAT IS POINTED TO OUR OWN HEAD. ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD DO THAT. WHAT WE DID WAS NOTHING SHORT OF IDIOTIC. WE OUGHT TO REVERSE IT, BANKRUPT IRAN, OUGHT TO UTILIZE OUR OWN FORMS OF ENERGY TO BANKRUPT WHAT THEY'RE CAPACITY IS -- THEIR CAPACITY IS. WE HAVE ENERGY RIGHT UNDER OUR OWN FEET. WE COULD PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK AND GIVE THEM GOOD JOBS. WE COULD LOWER THE ENERGY COSTS FOR AMERICANS WHICH MEANS THAT SINGLE MOM DRIVING TO WORK EVERY DAY SHOULD BE PAYING ONE DOLLAR FOR GAS NOT FOUR DOLLARS. MAKE IT SO THAT THE 84 YEAR OLD WIDOW COULD TURN HER AIR-CONDITIONING ON RATHER THAN HAVE TO LEAVE IT OFF BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD ELECTRIC BILL. WE CAN BECOME THE NUMBER ONE EXPLOITER, AND EXPORTER, OF ENERGY. WE WOULD TAKE THE MARKETS AWAY FROM RUSSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, AND IRAN. WHEN WE DO THAT, WE NOT ONLY TRANSFORM OUR ECONOMY, WE ALSO RESET THE WHOLE BALANCE OF WORLD POWER, AND WE TAKE THE POWER OF PUTIN AWAY, WE TAKE THE POWER OF THE IRANIANS AWAY, AND WE TAKE THE POWER OF THE SAUDIS AWAY TO TRAIN TERRORISTS TO FLY BUILDINGS INTO -- PLANES INTO BUILDINGS ON 9/11. SOMEBODY ELSE? >> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OBAMACARE SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. BUT, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ALSO AGREE THAT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T ABLE TO AFFORD IT. MIKE HUCKABEE: THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THAT OBAMACARE DID NOT ADDRESS THE REAL PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AND AMERICA'S NOT A HEALTH CARE CRISIS. WE HAVE THE BEST HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD. DO YOU KNOW ANYONE THAT YOU HAD A DIAGNOSIS FROM THE DOCTOR DID ANYONE SAY QUICK, GIMME TO HAVANA, CUBA. EVER HEARD OF THAT? NEVER. EVER HEARD ANYONE SAY MY GOODNESS I NEED TO GET TO SHANGHAI AS QUICK AS I CAN? NO. I W -- YOU HEAR I WANT TO GET TO NEW ORLEANS. IT IS IN AMERICA. THE BEST HEALTH CARE IS HERE. WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT A HEALTH CARE CRISIS, IT IS A HEALTH CRISIS. 80% OF THE MONEY WE ARE SPENDING IN AMERICA IS TREATING CHRONIC DISEASES. WE VERY SICK POPULATION. THAT IS EXPENSIVE. INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING LET'S PUT MORE MONEY TO TREAT PEOPLE WHO LET ILLNESSES, LET'S PUT THE MONEY TO PREVENT THE ILLNESSES FROM EVER HAPPENING AND TO CURE THE ONES THAT ARE CURABLE. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A PRESIDENT NAMED HUCKABEE SAID IN THE NEXT DECADE WE WILL FIND A CURE TO CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, AND ALZHEIMER'S. HERE'S WHAT WE DECIDED, JUST LIKE WE ERADICATED POLIO, I WAS THERE. I MIGHT NOT BE 89, BUT I CAN REMEMBER THIS. I WERE MEMBER LINING UP THE COURTHOUSE LAWN AND GETTING MY POLIO VACCINE. I NEVER GOT POLIO BECAUSE OF THAT. KIDS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME HAD TO WEAR BRACES ON THEIR LEGS. I NEVER DID. WE DO NOT SPEND MONEY LAST YEAR ON POLIO, BECAUSE WE BEAT IT. WHAT IF WE DID THE SAME THING TO OUR DISEASE, DIABETES, CANCER, AND ALZHEIMER'S? DO YOU REALIZE THAT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE COULD SAVE? RIGHT NOW CANCER TREATMENT IS OVER 100 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ALZHEIMER'S WILL HE $1.1 TRILLION BY THE YEAR 2050. WE TRANSFER NOT JUST THE ECONOMY, BUT THEY CAN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE. WE WILL FIND CURES TO THESE DISEASES. MOST OF US HAVE GONE THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THOSE DISEASES IN OUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY. WE KNOW HOW DEVASTATING IT IS. ALL FOUR OF THOSE HAVE TOUCHED MY FAMILY. MY MOTHER, FATHER, WIFE, MOTHER-IN-LAW, IT HAS TOUCHED MTYY FAMILY, AND YOURS. IF WE PUT OUR FOCUS ON YOUR RATHER THAN ASK YOUR RATHER THAN INTERVENTION. THEY CAN BE COVERED, AND SHOULD BE. OBAMACARE HAS DONE EXACT THE OPPOSITE. IT SAID IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP HIM, AND IT WILL COST YOU LESS EVERY YEAR. I AM WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY I KEPT MY DOCTOR, MY HEALTH INSURANCE, AND IT IS CHEAPER. EVER THE OPPOSITE. I'VE LOST MY DOCTOR, LOST HEALTH INSURANCE, AND AS AN THEY CAN'T AFFORD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT IS COSTING THOUSANDS MORE. BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NOW MAKING DECISIONS NOT TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS BUT TO SHRINK THEIR BUSINESS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT A BUSINESS OWNER IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP HIS EMPLOYEES UNDER 50 BECAUSE HE CANNOT AFFORD TO GROW HIS BUSINESS. YES TO SHRINK HIS BUSINESS. -- HE HAS TO SHRINK HIS BUSINESS. WE SAY SERVE MORE CUSTOMERS, NOT CUT BACK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE GOVERNMENT MANDATES. AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD ABSOLUTELY GET DONE. THE QUICKEST WAY TO DO THAT JOB WISE TO THE FAIR TAX. THE GROUP'S WAY HEALTH CARE WISE IS TO PUT THE FOCUS ON PREVENTION RATHER THAN INTERVENTION. IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU, CHRIS. I THINK THE NEED THAT. I HOPE THAT IS JUST WATER. I WILL BE TALKING FUNNY SOON. THAT'S JUST WATER, YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THIS. [LAUGHTER] LET ME TAKE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. I WON'T WEAR YOU OUT YOU MAY HAVE THINGS TO DO. >> I HEARD THE DONALD TRUMP MADE SOME COMMENTS TODAY ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN, AND HE DID NOT PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT? MIKE HUCKABEE: UNFORTUNATELY, HE DID SAY SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT HE LIKES -- HE WAS BEING DISPARAGING TOWARDS MCCAIN AND SAID HE WASN'T A HERO BECAUSE HE GOT CAPTURED, AND THE PEOPLE THAT GOT CAPTURED WITH THE LOSERS. I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, JOHN MCCAIN WAS MY POLITICAL OPPONENT EIGHT YEARS AGO, I'M HAPPY TO SAY AND BEAT HIM IN THE STATE. BUT ULTIMATELY HE BEAT ME. I WAS NEVER PERSONALLY BITTER ABOUT THAT, THAT IS HOW POLITICS WORKS. I WENT ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND CAMPAIGN FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WAS OUR NOMINEE. ONE THING I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE JOHN MCCAIN, AND I HAVE MANY DISAGREEMENTS WITH HIM, BUT I WILL NEVER QUESTION THAT MAN SACRIFICE AND SERVICE TO THIS GREAT NATION. FOR SIX YEARS HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR AND WAS TORTURED MERCILESSLY BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE, BRUTALLY TORTURED. I READ THE ACCOUNT OF MCCAIN'S INCARCERATION AND TORTURE. IT IS JUST STUNNING. I DON'T THINK MOST OF US ARE MADE OF THE STUFF HE IS MADE OF, TO TAKE THAT KIND OF TORTURE FOR SIX SOLID YEARS. HE DID SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN CLAIM, THROUGH ALL OF THAT, HE RETURNED WITH HONOR. I DON'T CARE IF HE WERE THE MOST LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN THE WORLD, I WOULD SAY HE EARNED MY RESPECT. I CAN DISAGREE POLITICALLY, BUT I WILL NEVER DISRESPECT THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE, NOT ONLY THAT HE PUT FORTH, BUT THAT EVERY VETERAN PUT FORTH. FOLKS, I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, I GET TO WALK ON FREE LAND, AND BREATHE FREE AIR, BECAUSE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT A UNIFORM ON AND SACRIFICE TO KEEP ME FREE. WHETHER THEY SAW COMBAT, OR WERE POWS, THEY SERVED, I LIVE FREE. NOT ONLY AM I GRATEFUL, BUT IF THERE IS ONE THING IN THIS COUNTRY WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE DO, IT IS ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PROMISE THAT WE MAKE TO THOSE VETERANS WE KEEP TENFOLD. THEY KEPT THEIR PROMISES TO US. THAT IS NOT A MONEY ISSUE, NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE, IT IS A MORAL ISSUE. KEEP YOUR WORD. MAKE A PROMISE, KEEP IT. IF YOU CAN'T KEEP IT, DON'T MAKE IT. I FEEL THE SAME THING ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL CHANGE ALL THE RULES, AND TAKING HOLD ON, MANY HAVE BEEN PAYING THIS SINCE WE WERE 14 YEARS OLD. NOBODY ASKED ME IF THEY COULD TAKE THAT OUT OF MY CHECK. THEY TOOK IT OUT WHETHER I LIKED IT OR NOT, WITH THE CAVEAT THAT IF THEY TOOK IT OUT WHEN I GOT TO BE 65 SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WOULD BE THERE. I WILL NOT HOPEFULLY HAVE TO DEPEND SOCIAL -- SOLELY ON THAT. BUT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY, AND SOME OF THEM IT IS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE. ARE WE HONESTLY, SERIOUSLY, TAKING IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THEIR DUTY? THEY HAVE ACCEPTED HAVING THAT CONFISCATED FROM THEIR CHECKS? I DON'T THINK SO. GOD HELP US IF WE ARE THAT DISHONEST. ONE FINAL QUESTION. >> HOWE M -- HOW MUCH IS IT COST TO BE TREATED THERE? MIKE HUCKABEE: IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE BEING TREATED FOR. >> SAY COLON CANCER. MIKE HUCKABEE: I CAN'T GIVE YOU A FIGURE AT THE MAYO CLINIC. MY WIFE HAD SPINAL CANCER, IT SCARED THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF US. WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. IT COST MORE THAN WE MADE OVER SEVERAL YEARS. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY GET SICK. I HAVE NEVER SUGGESTED THAT IT IS OK TO SAY YOU JUST SET THE TOUGH IT OUT. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF COUNTRY AMERICA IS. I DON'T WANT TO SEE A STREET THIS MONSTROUS GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT IS ALL ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT TELLS YOU YOU HAVE TO DO, AND HAVE TO PAY FOR. IT IS ABOUT INSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, BUT MAKING SURE WHAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IS AFFORDABLE, AND PORTABLE, AND THAT HE GOES WITH YOU JUST LIKE YOUR CAR OR FORM INSURANCE -- HOME INSURANCE. IT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. IF I SET FIRE TO MY HOUSE, I DON'T GET TO CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY. IF I RUN MY CAR INTO A TREE CAN CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND SAY I WAS PRETENDING I WAS RICHARD PETTY. I HAVE TO SHOW SOME RESPONSIBILITY. IF I WANT TO LIVE HIS RECKLESS AS POSSIBLE, IT WILL COST MORE TO INSURE MY CAR IN MY HOME. IT WILL PROBABLY COST MORE TO INSURE MY BODY IF I'M RECKLESS WITH MY OWN HEALTH. THAT IS THE INSURANCE HAS TO WORK. IT CAN'T WORK WHERE WE LET SOMEBODY ELSE PAY FOR OUR IRRESPONSIBILITY. >> AT THIS POINT, THE AVERAGE PERSON CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO THOSE FANCY CLINICS. MIKE HUCKABEE: AND YOU MAY NOT NEED TO. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE MAYO CLINIC, MYSELF. I GO TO THE LOCAL FACILITY WHERE I LIVE. I DID NOT MEAN THE MAYO CLINIC WAS THE ONLY PLACE, IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE PLACES. TEHRE SH -- THERE SHOULD BE A MEANS TO ACCESS THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THAT IS SOMETHING WE DID NOT WORK ON WITH OBAMACARE. WHAT WE WORKED HIM AS MAKING SURE THAT WE FORCE PEOPLE BY GOVERNMENT EDICT TO BUY A LEVEL OF INSURANCE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED, AND IT NOT WANT. BECAUSE OF OBAMA CARE MANDATES THE COVERAGES, I'M A 59-YEAR-OLD MALE, I HAVE MATERNITY COVERAGE. [LAUGHTER] IT IS MANDATED. I'M NOT SURE YOU LAUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING HOW RIDICULOUS. I AM PRETTY SURE I AM BN -- NOT GOING TO GET PREGNANT. AND IF I DO, I WILL GET A REALITY SHOW IN MAY SO MUCH MONEY ABLE NEED INSURANCE. THIS WILL BE HUGE. BUT I HAVE TO HAVE MATERNITY BENEFITS. I ALSO NEED BENEFITS FOR DRUG COUNSELING, I CANNOT A DRUG ADDICT -- AM NOT A DRUG ADDICT. I HAVE NEVER TASTED BEER, I HAVEN'T. I DON'T DRINK. AS A TEENAGER, AND A SMELLED IT, AND IT SMELLED AWFUL. MY FRIEND SAID WELL YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP A TASTE FOR IT. I MAY BE CRAZY ON SOME THINGS BEHIND EVERY RATIONAL AND SAID TO LET ME SEE IF I GET THIS RIGHT -- I HAVE TO DEVELOP A TASTE? WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF I GO AND CONTINUE TO TAKE SOMETHING INTO MY MOUTH THAT I FIND REPULSIVE THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO ACCEPT IT, THEN LIKE IT. I SAID THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. WHY WOULD I BEAT MY BODY INTO SUBMISSION TO ACCEPT SOMETHING? I AM NOT AT RISK FOR GETTING ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL, BUT I HAVE TO PAY FOR COVERAGE BECAUSE IT SOMEONE ELSE WANTS IT, I AM SUBSIDIZING THAT. SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT? I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T THINK SO. FOLKS, YOU HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HOPE I ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE UNDERMINED, AND HEART. MEMBER, FEBRUARY, WHERE WILL YOU BE? IN CAUCUS? WHO WILL YOU VOTE FOR? [LAUGHTER] IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR HUCKABEE, WHAT WILL YOU DO? STAY HOME. WE'VE GOT IT FOLKS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANKS FOR HOSTING THE EVENT. THANK YOU GUYS. THANKS FOR COMING OUT. [INDISCERNIBLE] [LAUGHTER] >> MY MOTHER IS A PASTOR. >> WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE SHE LOOKED ME RIGHT IN THE EYES. MY MOM SAID THAT. >> I SAID YES, MA'AM. MIKE HUCKABEE: HOW ARE YOU GUYS? HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL, I REALIZED THAT. HI, THERE. HOW ARE YOU DOING? WHAT I AM THINKING IS, YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH PEPPERONI. [INDISCERNIBLE] >> NO, HE IS AN ILLINOIS. MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT IS QUITE A DRIVE, ISN'T IT? DID YOU GET OUT THERE? >> NO. [INDISCERNIBLE] MIKE HUCKABEE: I AM GLAD YOU ALL CAME OUT HERE. >> I VOTED FOR YOU THE LAST TIME AROUND. YOU ARE ON MY BUCKET LIST TO MEET. MIKE HUCKABEE: GET THE CAMERA THERE, THEY WILL TAKE IT FOR US. THANK YOU. > IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU. . MIKE HUCKABEE: HERE WE GO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYER THIS AFTERNOON. >> YOU ARE WELCOME. MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT IS IMMANUEL IS NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS PHOTOGRAPHY. >> WHEN SOMEONE ASKS ME TO SMILE , I SAY I CAN'T. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS. YOU DID ALL THAT WITHOUT A TELEPROMPTER? MIKE HUCKABEE: THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE. >> COULD I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH? MIKE HUCKABEE: SURE. MY FATHER RAISE ME TO BELIEVE IF YOU TELL THE TRUTH YOU DON'T NOT REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID. I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE. >> 2017. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT VP, BUT -- MIKE HUCKABEE: I HAVE TO GET THE FIRST SLOT FIRST. >> I AM PLUGGING FOR BOTH OF YOU. MIKE HUCKABEE: THAT IS NOT A BAD IDEA. THANK YOU. YOU MUST LIKE TO HUNT. >> I AM A STORM CHASER FOR THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE DRIVING BY. MIKE HUCKABEE: DO YOU LIVE HERE IN IOWA? >> I WAS IN DES MOINES. MIKE HUCKABEE: HOW LONG IF YOU BEEN CHASING STORMS? >> SINCE I WAS 16. MIKE HUCKABEE: WE HAD SOME BAD TORNADOES. I WAS IN TWO PERSONALLY. TERRIBLE STUFF. >> I AM GLAD YOU'RE RUNNING. YOU ARE THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT. MIKE HUCKABEE: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE. >>",2015-11-07 17:54:41,2015-07-22,Greenland,New Hampshire

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GLAD YOU COULD BE HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. YEAH. I WAS IN LAS VEGAS. SOMEBODY BROUGHT ME A BABY NAMED, ""REAGAN."" GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU? >> THANK YOU FOR SUPPLYING LIFE. >> CAN YOU SMILE? >> JUST LOOKING AROUND. IT LOOKS LIKE POPPA. >> I HAVE FOLLOWED WALKER'S CAREER. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I AM ONE OF THE FIRST REPRESENTATIVES IN THE HOUSE TO SIGN ONTO THE CAMPAIGN AND ENDORSE HIM. AFTER SEEING THE THINGS HE WENT THROUGH AS GOVERNOR, HE PROMISED TO BRING FISCAL REFORM AND GET WISCONSIN BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WHEN HE TOOK OVER, THE STATE WAS $3.6 BILLION IN DEBT. HE TURNED IT AROUND AND CLOSED THE GAP. THEY HAD A RAINY DAY FUND AND THEN LOWERED TAXES WHILE DOING THIS. HE HAS A GREAT RESUME AND THIS IS THE PERSON IN THAT WE NEED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND, SO, WHEN THE GOVERNOR TALKED TO ME A COUPLE OF TIMES -- I MET HIM TWICE NOW -- AND HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD SUPPORT HIS CAMPAIGN, I SAID I WOULD. GETTING TO KNOW HIM A LITTLE BIT AND TALKING TO HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES, I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. HE IS A GREAT GUY. HE IS A LEADER. HE WOULD BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. THE GOVERNOR, IN HIS SPARE TIME, WHICH HE HAS LITTLE OF, I KNOW THAT. HE WORKS HARD IN MADISON AND IS STILL WORKING TO KEEP WISCONSIN ON THE RIGHT TRACK. HE BELIEVES THE PRINCIPLES IN WISCONSIN WOULD BE A GOOD MODEL FOR THE NATION AND I AGREE WITH HIM. I THINK HE HAS THE RIGHT THING GOING RIGHT NOW. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE 45TH GOVERNOR WISCONSIN, SCOTT WALKER. SCOTT WALKER: THANK YOU. THANKS. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AFTER THE INTRODUCTION LIKE THAT , BEING ONE OF THE EARLY LEADERS AND THE REPRESENTATIVE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST. WE APPRECIATE IT. GREAT JOB OF HOSTING. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HERE AND WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING WITH US. I LIKE TO SAY TWO QUICK THINGS ON A SERIOUS NOTE. I WOULD LIKE TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OF PRAYER TO THINK ABOUT -- THE OTHER DAY -- A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO -- I TALKED TO BILL IN TENNESSEE. THAT DAY ALONE, WE LOST FOUR MARINES IN THE HORRIBLE ACCIDENT IN TENNESSEE AND THREE INDIVIDUALS -- A MARINE, SAILOR, AND AN OFFICER WERE SHOT. WE HAVE LOST ANOTHER. IT IS NOW FIVE WHOSE LIVES WERE TAKEN. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO SAY A PRAYER FOR THOSE FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES, AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER MEN AND WOMEN WHO CONTINUE TO SERVE TODAY IN HARM'S WAY HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD. CAN WE JUST PAUSE AND PRAY FOR THEM? THANK YOU. AND, ONE OTHER THE THING I WANT TO SAY, EARLIER TODAY, I MAKE A PRACTICE OF NOT COMMENTING ON THE POSITIONS OF OTHER REPUBLICANS. MY VIEW IS THAT I WOULD SHARE WHAT I AM FOR. I HAVE BEEN ASKED A BIT ABOUT WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS CANDIDATE OR THAT CANDIDATE AND I SAY, THEY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. ON POLICY, THEY CAN TALK FOR THEMSELVES. TODAY, ONE OF THE CANDIDATES MADE A COMMENT ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN. SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HIS POLITICS, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BUT LET ME BE FUNDAMENTALLY CLEAR THAT JOHN MCCAIN IS AMERICAN HERO AND I WILL DENOUNCE ANYONE WHO SPEAKS ILL OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER OF WAR. NOT JUST JOHN MCCAIN. BUT ANYONE ELSE LIKE THAT, WE NEED TO STAND UP AND DEFEND THEM. I WILL MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR SOMEONE WHO GOES PERSONAL ON SOMEONE FROM OUR MILITARY. I WILL ALWAYS DEFEND THE VETERANS, REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: I AM GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY AND IT IS NICE TO BE AT A HARLEY DEALERSHIP. I ACTUALLY RIDE A 2000 THREE RD KING. -- 2003 ROAD KING. I HAD A LOT OF FUN. JOANIE AND I HAD A LOT OF FUN. WE NEED TO RIDE AS MUCH AS WE CAN. IF I WIN, I MIGHT NOT BE RIDING FOR EIGHT YEARS. I WANT TO GET AS MUCH WRITING -- RIDING AS I CAN. WE ARE CRISS-CROSSING THE COUNTRY AND HAVING FUN. I HAVE MY WIFE, TONETTE. MY TWO SONS, MATT AND ALEX. WE HAVE A WINNEBAGO AND WE ARE CRISS-CROSSING THE STATE. WE WERE PLAYING GAMES WITH MY NIECES ISABELLA AND HAVE A ARE HERE. A GREAT TIME. I LOVE TIMES LIKE THIS IN THE WINNEBAGO. WE ARE DOING THE FULL GRASSLEY. JUST LIKE SENATOR GRASSLEY AND SENATOR ERNST AND MY FRIEND, WE ARE DOING ALL 99 COUNTIES. WE ARE MAKING A PLAY TO WIN IN THE CAUCUSES, AND GOING AHEAD AND WINNING IN NOVEMBER IN 2016. A PATH TO THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENCY GOES THROUGH THE MIDWEST. THAT INVOLVES IOWA, MICHIGAN, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA. FOR US, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO WIN. WE ARE HERE TO DO WELL IN THE CAUCUSES AS WELL AS TO COME BACK AND DO WELL IN NOVEMBER 2016. YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF US. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF FUN HERE. WE LOVE GOING THROUGH THE COUNTIES. MONDAY, WE MADE THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT AS TO OUR INTENTIONS AND NOW, WE CAN OFFICIALLY SAY IN IOWA, THAT I AM SCOTT WALKER, RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, AND I AM ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: I WAS TALKING ABOUT VETERANS AND I MENTIONED A FEW VETERANS FROM WORLD WAR I AND WORLD WAR II WHO LIVED UP THE BLOCK FOR ME AND A VIETNAM VETERAN WHO HAD AN INFLUENCE. I AM REMINDED OF THEM AND OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY REMIND ME THAT AMERICA IS A CAN-DO KIND OF COUNTRY THAT HAS A GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON THEY CAN'T QUITE SEEM TO GET THE JOB DONE. I HAVE GOOD NEWS. IT IS NOT TOO LATE. HELP IS ON THE WAY. WE CAN MAKE THE COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: TO DO THAT, WE NEED THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS NEW, FRESH, GETS THINGS DONE. THAT IS WHAT WE DID ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI. WE GOT THINGS DONE IN WISCONSIN. A BLUE STATE. SINCE I HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR, WE TOOK ON THE UNIONS. 100,000 PROTESTERS OCCUPIED THE CAPITAL. THEY DID A RECALL. WE DIDN'T BACK DOWN, WE WEREN'T INTIMIDATED. IF WE CAN TAKE THEM ON THERE, WE CAN TAKE THEM ON ANYWHERE. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: WE LOOK AT THAT AND SAY, WE LOWER TAXES ON INDIVIDUALS, EMPLOYERS, FARMERS, PROPERTY OWNERS, AND TAXES ARE LOWER IN MY STATE THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. IN THE LAST BUDGET I JUST SIGNED A WEEK AGO, THEY WILL BE LOWER IN 2016 IN THAN 2010. HOW MANY GOVERNORS CAN SAY THAT ACROSS AMERICA? WE DID LAWSUIT REFORM AND REGULATORY REFORM. WE DEFUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND PASSED PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION. [APPLAUSE] WE ENACTED CASTLE DOCTRINE AND CONCEAL CARRY. SO THAT LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILY, AND THEIR PROPERTY. NOW, WE HAVE A LAW THAT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PHOTO ID TO VOTE IN MY STATE. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: SO I SAY, IF IT CAN WORK IN A BLUE STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, IT CAN WORK ANYWHERE IN AMERICA. WHETHER IT IS TRAVELING ACROSS THE STATE, I HEAR THEY ARE TIRED ABOUT POLITICIANS WHO SAY THEY ARE AGAINST THINGS. AMERICANS WANT TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING AND SOMEONE. LET ME SPEND A COUPLE MINUTES TELLING YOU WHAT I AM FOR. I AM FOR REFORM, GROWTH, SAFETY. I AM FOR TRANSFERRING POWER OUT OF WASHINGTON AND PUTTING IT IN THE HANDS OF TAXPAYERS. THAT IS REAL REFORM. I AM FOR A BETTER ECONOMY THAT ALLOWS EVERYBODY LIVE A PIECE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT IS PROGROWTH. I AM FOR PROTECTING YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN FROM RADICAL TERRORISM. THAT IS TRUE SAFETY. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: SO, REFORM, GROWTH, SAFETY. I WILL TELL YOU WHY I AM FOR REAL REFORM IN WASHINGTON. WE HAD REFORMS THAT TOOK POWER OUT OF BIG GOVERNMENT SPENDERS AND PUT IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE HARD-WORKING TAXPAYERS. BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING BETTER AND PEOPLE ARE DOING BETTER. IN WASHINGTON, THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT THEY MEASURE SUCCESS BY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT. WE SHOULD MEASURE SUCCESS BY THE OPPOSITE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT? WE UNDERSTAND THAT TRUE FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY -- YOU CAN CLAP FOR THAT. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY TO NOT COME FROM THE MIGHTY HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT, IT COMES FROM LETTING PEOPLE CONTROL THEIR OWN LIVES IN THEIR OWN DESTINIES. PROSPERITY COMES FROM WORK. I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN AND MY BROTHER AND I WERE BORN TO A PREACHER. HE WAS CALLED TO BE A MINISTER IN COLORADO SPRINGS. THAT IS WHERE I WAS BORN IN 1967. HE WAS CALLED TO BE A MINISTER . MY PARENTS WERE CALLED TO A CHURCH CALLED PLAINFIELD WITH A POPULATION OF 450. ONE YEAR LATER, MY BROTHER CAME , HE WAS BORN IN WAVERLY, IOWA. YOU CAN TELL HOLD THIS PICTURE IS, I HAD TO PULL IT OUT OF THE PHOTOBOMBING, IT STILL HAS THE GLUE LINES FROM WHERE YOU PULL THE PLASTIC OFF ANY FULL PICTURE OFF. I HAVE A PICTURE OF MY BROTHER AND I 40 YEARS AGO. OUR SMALL TOWN HAD AN AMERICAN FLAG IN THE STATE HALL, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE IN IOWA STATE FLAG. WE GOT THE MAYONNAISE JAR AND GOT ENOUGH COINS IN THE JAR TO BUY THE STATE FLAG AND, MY MOM TOOK A PICTURE AND HE WAS MUCH CUTER THAN NOW. HE IS THE GUY ON THE LEFT. I WAS A COUPLE YEARS OLDER. THAT IS A GREAT REMINDER AND I MOVED TO WISCONSIN AND THAT IS WHERE DAVID AND I GREW UP. I THINK ABOUT THE ROUTES AND MY FIRST JOB WAS WASHING DISHES AND I MOVED UP TO THE BIG TIME AND STARTED FLIPPING HAMBURGERS AT MCDONALD'S. WHEN I STARTED FLIPPING BURGERS, MY FRIEND PAUL RYAN, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM, HE WAS COOKING HAMBURGERS ABOUT 15 MILES AROUND THE ROAD. HIS MANAGER TOLD HIM HE DID NOT HAVE THE INTERPERSONAL SKILLS TO WORK THE CASH REGISTER. I WONDER WHETHER MANAGERS THINKING TODAY? I THINK ABOUT THAT AND I THINK ABOUT MY PARENTS AND MY DAD BEING A SMALL-TOWN PREACHER. MY MOM BEING A PART-TIME SECRETARY AND BOOKKEEPER AT A LITTLE BUSINESS IN OUR TOWN. MY GRANDPARENTS WERE FARMERS WHO DID NOT HAVE INDOOR PLUMBING. UNTIL MY MOTHER WENT OFF TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. MY DAD WAS A MACHINIST AND A -- MY DADS DAD WAS A MACHINIST AT A FACTORY IN ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS. IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU PLAY BY THE RULES, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT. THAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND THAT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. [APPLAUSE] SO, LET ME SPEND ANOTHER MINUTE TO TELL YOU WHY I AM FOR A PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC PLAN. -- A PRO-GROWTH ECONOMIC PLAN. YOU SEE, THERE IS A REAL CONTRAST. I BELIEVE THAT THE TOP-DOWN , GOVERNMENT KNOWS BEST APPROACH , WE NEED A COUNTER. WE NEED TO BUILD THE ECONOMY FROM THE GROUND UP. AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT HURT THE SAFETY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR, START YOUR OWN CAREER AND BUILD YOUR HOME BUSINESS. LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE. THAT IS FREEDOM! THE KIND OF FREEDOM THAT IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM! OUR PLAN HAS FIVE SIMPLE THINGS. CREATE MORE JOBS IN THE COUNTRY AND RAISE WAGES BY REPEALING OBAMACARE ONCE AND FOR ALL TO PUT DECISIONS BACK IN THE HANDS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: WE NEED TO REIGN IN THE REGULATORY CLIMATE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I AM ALL FOR ENFORCING COMMON SENSE. LET'S GET RID OF BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE. IT HURTS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND FARMERS. YOU KNOW IT IN THE STATE AND ACROSS THE MIDWEST. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A REAL BURDEN. IT IS A BLANKET ON THE ECONOMY. WE NEED TO LIFT IT UP. WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE THE ALL OF THE ABOVE ENERGY POLICY. THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE ENERGY-RICH. WE CAN FUEL THE RECOVERY ON THE RIGHT PATH. THEN, I SAY, LET'S FIND A WAY TO GET PEOPLE THE EDUCATION AND THE QUALIFICATIONS TO SUCCEED. WE CAN FIND CAREERS THAT PAY MORE. LET THE OTHER SIDE TALK ABOUT HOW LOW WAGES ARE. WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE THE SKILLS AND EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE. [APPLAUSE] I AM PROUD OF THE REFORMS WOULD PUT IN THE STATE. WE REFORMED PUBLIC EDUCATION AND WE PROVIDE MORE QUALITY CHOICES FOR FAMILIES BECAUSE I TRUST PARENTS TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. I WANT EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA, NO MATTER WHAT THE BACKGROUND OR THE ZIP CODE THEY COME FROM, THEY DESERVE ACCESS TO GREAT EDUCATION IN THE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC OR THE VIRTUAL OR HOMESCHOOLED ENVIRONMENT. EVERY CHILD DESERVES ACCESS TO A GREAT EDUCATION IN AMERICA AND I BELIEVE IN A HIGH STANDARDS. I BELIEVE THOSE STANDARDS SHOULD BE SET AT A LOCAL LEVEL. I DO NOT BELIEVE IN COMMON CORE OR A NATIONWIDE SCHOOL BOARD. WE NEED TO TAKE POWER AND SEND IT BACK TO OUR STATES AND SCHOOLS. IT IS MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. [APPLAUSE] NOW, I HAVE A DOLLAR HERE. IT IS SIMPLE. WHERE WOULD YOU SPEND THE DOLLAR? WOULD YOU KEEP IT IN THE SCHOOL? MOST OF US WOULD KEEP IT HERE. WE WOULD RATHER KEEP HERE WITH OUR KIDS SCHOOLS OR RECONNECTION TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUSHING THE KIND OF REFORM. SPEAKING OF DOLLARS, PROGROWTH WILL HELP GROW THE ECONOMY AND WE NEED TO LOWER THE BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYERS SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP MORE OF THE MONEY. THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD. I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE WE DID IT IN MY STATE. $2 BILLION WORTH OF TAX RELIEF. SOME PEOPLE DID ME GRIEF ON WHY I FOCUS SO MUCH ATTENTION ON TAX RELIEF. IT IS SIMPLE. TONETTE AND I LOVE TO SHOP IN A PLACE -- AT A PLACE CALLED KOHL'S. I HAVE TOLD THE STORY SO MANY TIMES, THERE WAS A FUNNY SEGMENT ON JIMMY FALLON. I'M NOTHING BUT CONSISTENT. IF I GO TO KOHL'S I GO TO THE RACK THAT SAYS IT IS $29.99. AND THEN WE PULL OUT THE INSERT THE GET YOU THE EXTRA DISCOUNT. MAYBE IF I REMEMBER TO GET THE MAILER, 15%-20% OR, IF I AM LUCKY, %30. I KNOW WHO SHOP THE KOHL'S, I SEE THE NONCE. WE GIVE THEM THE COUPONS AND AT THE LAST MINUTE, TONETTE PULLS OUT THE KOHL'S CASH AND IT IS LIKE WE ARE GETTING PAID FOR THE SHIRT. IT FEELS LIKE IT. HOW DOES A MIDWESTERN COMPANY LIKE THIS MAKE MONEY? THEY MAKE IT OFF OF VOLUME. THEY CAN CHARGE A HIGHER PRICE AND FEWER PEOPLE CAN AFFORD IT, OR THEY COULD THEY CAN LOWER THE BASE. THE GOVERNMENT COULD CHARGE HIGHER RATES IN A FEW PEOPLE COULD AFFORD IT. OR, WE COULD LOWER THE RATES AND HAVE MORE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE. YEARS AGO, THAT WORKED WITH RONALD REAGAN. THEY CALLED IT THE LAFFER CURVE. TODAY, I CALL IT THE KOHL'S CURVE. I BELIEVE YOU CAN SPEND YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY BETTER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] THE THIRD THING IS, TO PROSPER, WE NEED TO LIVE IN A SAFE AND STABLE WORLD. THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAS A SACRED DUTY TO DEFEND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE BEST PRESIDENT WHEN IT CAME TO NATIONAL SECURITY WAS A GOVERNOR FROM CALIFORNIA WHO REBUILT THE MILITARY, STOOD UP FOR OUR ALLIES AND WITHOUT APOLOGY. WE STOOD FOR STRONG AMERICAN VALUES, AND THAT LED TO ONE OF THE MOST PEACEFUL TIMES IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. UNDER OBAMA-CLINTON, AMERICA LEADS FROM BEHIND AND WE HEAD TOWARDS DISASTER. THE PRESIDENT DRAWS LINES IN THE SAND AND ALLOWS THEM TO GET CROSSED. HE CALLS ISIS ""THE JV SQUAD."" HE CALLS YEMEN A SUCCESS STORY. IRAN A PLACE WE CAN DO BUSINESS WITH. WE TIED RIBBONS AROUND THE TREE IN THE LATE 70'S, DURING THE 444 WHEN IRAN HELD 52 AMERICANS HOSTAGE. IRAN HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE THEN. IRAN IS NOT A COUNTRY WE SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS WITH AND I WILL TERMINATE A BAD DEAL WITH IRAN, REINSTATE SANCTIONS, AND CONVINCE OUR ALLIES TO DO THE SAME. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: ON TOP OF ALL THAT, AT THE STATE OF THE UNION, YOU HEARD HIM SAY -- PROCLAIM -- THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS WAS CLIMATE CHANGE. CLIMATE CHANGE. MR. PRESIDENT, I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. THE GREATEST THREAT IS RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN START BY LIFTING THE POLITICAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE MILITARY PERSONNEL IN IRAQ SO THEY CAN RECLAIM THE TERRITORY TAKEN BY ISIS. ON BEHALF OF YOUR CHILDREN IN MIND, I WOULD RATHER TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM THAN WAIT FOR THEM TO BRING THE FIGHT TO US. WE NEED TO IGNORE KNOWLEDGE -- ACKNOWLEGE ISRAEL AND START TREATING THEM LIKE AN ALLY. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: WE NEED TO STOP THE AGGRESSION OF RUSSIA. PUTIN BELIEVES THAT YOU PROBE WITH BAYONETS. IF YOU FIND MUSH, YOU PUSH. IF YOU FIND STEEL, YOU STOP. UNDER OBAMA AND CLINTON, VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS FOUND YEAR AFTER YEAR OF MUSH. WE NEED TO HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY THAT PUTS STEEL IN FRONT OF THE ENEMIES. WE NEED TO STOP CYBER ATTACKS IN SLOW THE ADVANCES IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS. WE NEED TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT THE ABYSMAL HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. WE NEED TO SECURE THE BORDER, ENFORCE THE LAWS, STAND UP FOR A LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PUTS PRIORITY ON AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES AND WAGES IN A WAY THAT IMPROVES THE ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: WE NEED TO GIVE OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED NOT JUST TO KEEP A SAFE ABROAD. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES HERE. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM QUALITY HEALTH CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] SCOTT WALKER: THE BEST WAY TO HONOR THEM IS BY FIGHTING TO WIN. THERE WILL BE TIMES -- THAT IS RIGHT. THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS IMPORTANT. THE GOAL SHOULD BE PEACE. IT SHOULD BE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. THERE WILL BE TIMES WHERE AMERICA MUST FIGHT. IF WE MUST, AMERICA'S FIGHTING TO WIN. THE REST OF THE WORLD MUST KNOW THERE IS NO GREATER FRIEND OR WORST ENEMY THAN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO, THERE ARE PRETTY BIG CHALLENGES FOR THIS PRESIDENT . DOMESTICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, IT IS WHERE WE STAND IN THE WORLD. I AM AN OPTIMIST. I LOVE AMERICA. I LOVE THE AMERICAN SPIRIT. I LOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I BELIEVE YOU LOVE AMERICA, OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE. I KNOW TIME IS NOT TOO LATE. I KNOW WE CAN TURN THINGS AROUND. WE NEED THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT FIELD. NOT GOING TO SPEAK AND WILL THE OTHERS INDIVIDUALLY, BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THIS ELECTION. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OUT THERE. THERE ARE FIGHTERS AND THERE ARE WINNERS. THERE ARE MANY IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AND HAVE NOT WON THE FIGHT. THEY ARE WINNERS. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ELECTED AND REELECTED. BUT THEY HAVE NOT CONSISTENTLY FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHTS. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD WHO IS CONSISTENTLY FIGHTING AND WINNING. NOT JUST THREE ELECTIONS IN FOUR YEARS IN A BLUE STATE THAT HASN'T GONE REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT SINCE 1984. IT IS SOMEONE WHO HAS WON COMMON SENSE FIGHTS. IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR YOU AND AMERICA, I AM THE CANDIDATES GOING FORWARD AND I ASK YOU TO CAUCUS FOR ME, I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT US, AND I ASKED YOU FOR YOUR VOTE IN NOVEMBER IF I'M YOUR NOMINEE. PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME, WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? I HAVE TWO SIMPLE REASONS. MATT AND ALEX, MY BOYS. THEY ARE THE REASON WHY I DECIDED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR. I KNEW IT WOULD BE TOUGH AND I THANKFUL THAT WAS THE REASON THAT I RAN. WHEN WE GOT DEATH THREATS AND FACED THE NUMBER ONE TARGET, IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORTH IT. I KNOW THAT I WANT THEM TO GROW UP IN A STATE THAT ARE THAN I GREW UP IN. I'M PROUD TO TELL YOU, BECAUSE WE STOOD FIRM AND WE DID WHAT WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO, OUR STATE IS BETTER BECAUSE OF IT. THEIR LIFE AND FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL BENEFIT FROM IT. TODAY IN AMERICA, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HALF THEY ARE HEADED ON OTHERS IN THEIR GENERATION AS WELL. THE REASON I AM RUNNING IS SIMPLE AND IT IS BECAUSE OF MATT AND ALEX. IT'S BECAUSE OF MY NIECES, AND IT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. AND ALL THOSE OTHERS YET TO BE BORN. I KNOW LIKE YOU KNOW THAT WE WANT THE CHILDREN TO INHERIT A BETTER AMERICA. I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT TOO LATE. IT CANNOT BE TOO LATE. WITH YOUR HELP, WORKING TOGETHER, WE WILL NOT ONLY WIN THE ELECTION, WE WILL TAKE THE COUNTRY DOWN THE RIGHT PATH. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> YOU HAVE MY VOTE. YOU HAVE MY VOTE. >> THANK YOU. >> YOU HAVE MY VOTE. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU?>> SEVEN. SCOTT WALKER: THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. >> MY FAMILY REALLY ENJOYS YOU. >> ARE BROUGHT THE KIDS AND GRAND -- I BROUGHT THE KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN. SCOTT WALKER: I AM SO GLAD.

THAT IS PRETTY COOL. GOING INTO THE SECOND GRADE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] SCOTT WALKER: WE WANT TO TRY AND TURN THIS COUNTRY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. >> ARE YOU ANSWERING QUESTIONS? WHAT YOU GOING TO DO ON IMMIGRATION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HERE? I UNDERSTAND SECURING THE BORDERS. EVERYONE IS SAYING THAT. WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY HERE? SCOTT WALKER: WE CONTINUE TO SECURE THE BORDER AND START ENFORCING THE LAW. WE CAN START DEALING WITH THAT AFTERWARDS. SO MANY FOLKS IN THE MEDIA WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE FIRST. THEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND THE NEXT CONGRESS CAN DEAL WITH THAT IN THAT ORDER. YOU CAN VISIT SCOTT WALKER.COM AND CHECK OUT ALL THE ISSUES. >> DO MY TO FIGHT GET A PICTURE -- DO YOU MIND IF I GET A PICTURE? SCOTT WALKER: NO PROBLEM. WE LOVE IT. NEXT IS ANDY. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. SCOTT WALKER: THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] SCOTT WALKER: THE PICTURE IS OUT IN FRONT OF THE PARSONAGE. THAT'S RIGHT IN THE BACKYARD. 218 WOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE. WILL BE BACK THERE ON SUNDAY. >> ONE OF THE FOLKS IN OUR CHURCH HAS A FARM OVER THERE. SCOTT WALKER: IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, I MOVED IN 1977. >> CAN WE GET A PICTURE? >> I HOPE WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THAT SUPREME COURT? SCOTT WALKER: WHEN YOU PUT PEOPLE IN PLACE, AS THE GOVERNOR, I DO THAT. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE LAW AND SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE PROPER ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY. NO MORE. [INDISCERNIBLE] >> HI, GOVERNOR. CAN I GET A PICTURE? >> WE WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET YOU ELECTED. SCOTT WALKER: THE CYCLONES HAVE BEEN MESSING ME UP. I HAD BEEN GOING TO THE FINAL FOUR, THEY MUST MY BRACKET UP. -- THEY MESSED MY BRACKET UP. >> THANK YOU. SCOTT WALKER: IRA BERLIN WISCONSIN WASN'T SO GOOD AT FOOTBALL. >> MY BROTHER PLAYED FOR HAYDEN RIGHT. SCOTT WALKER: THAT'S THE BIG TEN. THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME. MY DAD WENT TO THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH ON 218. >> I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. >> WE HAVE A DAUGHTER LIVING IN MILWAUKEE. SCOTT WALKER: WHERE SHE IN MILWAUKEE? >> IN MAC ONE -- MEQUON. SCOTT WALKER: ALL RIGHT. >> YOU HAVE MY VOTE. SCOTT WALKER: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU. SCOTT WALKER: YOU ARE SWEET, THANKS FOR COMING OUT. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] >> I'M ON THE CITY COUNCIL, I APPRECIATE YOU REMEMBERING THE SMALL TOWNS IN IOWA. SCOTT WALKER: I GREW UP IN A VERY SMALL TOWN. >> IT IS VERY SIMILAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD TO MEET YOU. SCOTT WALKER: [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE SWEET, THANK YOU. TELL BECAUSE WE'RE FOR IT. GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS. I COME OUT AND DO OUR CO-OP. THE WHOLE BIT. >> WE APPRECIATE YOU. SCOTT WALKER: LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, LET THE MARKET DRIVE. THEY'RE GOING TO DO GOOD STUFF. LESS TO SEND TO THOSE FOLKS OVERSEAS. >> THEY WANT YOU TO BE A HONEY BADGER. REMEMBER? SCOTT WALKER: I KNOW. I KNOW. >> THAT WAS MY DAUGHTER THE GUY IN THE PICTURE. SCOTT WALKER: I STILL HEAR FROM ONE OF THE GUYS IN TUCSON, ARIZONA NOW. >> YOU GET THAT STORY OUT THERE. [INDISCERNIBLE] >> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON REDUCING CORPORATE TAX RATES? SCOTT WALKER: I DIDN'T MENTION THAT. I THINK IF WE MAKE IT COMPETITIVE AGAIN, WE CAN BRING MORE JOBS BACK FROM OVERSEAS. IT'S A POPULIST MESSAGE. >> ISN'T A LITTLE BIT OF TAX BETTER THAN NO TAX? SCOTT WALKER: IF YOU MADE IT COMPETITIVE. SO MANY JOBS WERE LOST OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. THAT WOULD BE MAJOR INCENTIVE. >> THANK YOU. SCOTT WALKER: I LIKE YOUR SHIRT. >> I LOVE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH WISCONSIN. IT'S BEEN GREAT, I MOVED BACK UP THERE AT THE END OF MAY. I'M IN TRANSITION. DO IT FOR THE COUNTRY. CAN I GET A PICTURE? SCOTT WALKER: SURE. >> THANK YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. SCOTT WALKER: GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. WORKING HARD. WE APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET. >> THE OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPHER. >> CAN I PHOTOBOMB? SCOTT WALKER: THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT, I APPRECIATE IT. YOU MET MY WIFE? >> YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A HANDSHAKE. WE HAD A DAUGHTER GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MADISON. I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE WHAT THEY DID. SCOTT WALKER: THANKFULLY WE CLEANED IT UP PRETTY GOOD NOW. >> DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. SCOTT WALKER: A LITTLE DIFFERENT OVER THERE. >> HANG IN THERE. SCOTT WALKER: GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> WE WERE IN THE SENATE. SCOTT WALKER: THAT'S RIGHT, WE CAME THROUGH. WE WENT THROUGH WITH THEM. >> WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND WE ARE GOING TO WELCOME YOU TO COME.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327340-1/hillary-clinton-remarks-economy,Hillary Clinton Remarks on the Economy,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"CHANCE TO SEE A SUMMIT HELD BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS -- GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION. >> DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN NEW YORK CITY FRIDAY, WHERE SHE TALKED ABOUT HER ECONOMIC AGENDA. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS INCLUDED CHANGES TO CAPITAL GAINS AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. AT THE START OF THIS EVENT, SHE SPOKE ABOUT HER USE OF A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER WELL SERVING AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND ALLEGATIONS OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BEING MISHANDLED IN THE PROCESS. THIS IS JUST OVER AN HOUR. >> HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MRS. CLINTON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI. HI. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. I -- I WANT TO TELL YOU IT IS WONDERFUL BEING BACK HERE AT NYU AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING ME TODAY, AND ESPECIALLY MY GOOD FRIEND AND FORMER COLLEAGUE CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN MALONEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF MY FURTHER. ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND THE WORK THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO DO IN THE YEARS AHEAD. FIRST, I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE NEWS TODAY. AND IT IS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF INACCURACIES, AS CONGRESSMAN CUMMINGS MADE CLEAR THIS MORNING. MAYBE THE HEAT IS GETTING TO EVERYBODY. WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THIS RIGHT. I HAVE RELEASED 55,000 PAGES OF E-MAILS. I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT I WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS BEFORE THE HOUSE COMMITTEE. WE ARE ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO GET THE FACTS RIGHT, AND I WILL DO MY PART. BUT I AM ALSO GOING TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES, PARTICULARLY THE BIG ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER TO AMERICAN FAMILIES. YOU KNOW, OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING YOUNG PEOPLE ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. MANY CAME OF AGE IN THE WAKE OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE DEEP RECESSION A CAUSE. THE FALLOUT FROM THAT CRASH HAS TEMPERED THEIR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE AND LEFT THEM CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE AND THAT AMERICA FACES. YET LIKE GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS BEFORE THEM, THERE IS ALSO UNDIMMED OPTIMISM. TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PREPARING TO ENTER AN ECONOMY THEY KNOW WILL BE COMPETITIVE. NOT JUST AT HOME, BUT GLOBALLY. THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FIND A GOOD JOB AFTER GRADUATION THAT CAN HELP THEM GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THE RISK OF A SETBACK, OR POTENTIALLY ANOTHER CRISIS, IS NEVER FAR FROM THEIR MINDS. BUT WHAT INSPIRES ME IS THEY ARE UNDAUNTED BY THESE CHALLENGES. THEY ARE SEEKING REAL OPPORTUNITIES AND REAL REWARDS FOR THE WORK THEY PUT IN AND THEY ARE HOPEFUL THAT TOMORROW WILL INDEED BE BETTER THAN TODAY. SO, I HEAR THE STORIES EVERYWHERE I GO. THE HARD WORK AND GRIT AND SACRIFICE OF PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY THAT HAVE BROUGHT US THAT AND DRIVEN OUR RECOVERY. SO, YES, NOW WE ARE STANDING AGAIN, BUT WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY AMERICA SHOULD. NO COUNTRY IS BETTER POSITIONED TO THRIVE IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT WE ARE. WE HAVE THE MOST INNOVATIVE, ENTERPRISING PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE MOST TALENTED WORKERS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE AT NEAR RECORD HIGHS, BUT PAYCHECKS FOR NORMAL PEOPLE HAVE BARELY BUDGED. AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR EVERYTHING, FROM HEALTH CARE TO CHILDCARE TO COLLEGE TO CARING FOR AGING PARENTS, ARE RISING A LOT FASTER THAN WAGES. THAT IS PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE, AND NORMAN US PRESSURE ON FAMILIES AND THEIR BUDGETS. MY MISSION, FROM MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT TO THE LAST WILL BE TO RAISE THE INCOMES OF HARD-WORKING AMERICANS SO THEY CAN ONCE AGAIN AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. WE NEED TO -- [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO END THE WAGE STAGNATION THAT IS HOLDING BACK OUR FAMILIES AND HOLDING BACK OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS THE DEFINING ECONOMIC CHALLENGE NOT ONLY OF THIS ELECTION, BUT OUR TIME. IT GETS TO THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THE BASIC BARGAIN OF AMERICA. IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. AND WHEN YOU GET AHEAD, OUR COUNTRY GETS AHEAD, TOO. I LAID OUT A BROAD ECONOMIC AGENDA TO RAISE INCOMES AND BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE ALREADY AT THE TOP. IT IS AN AGENDA FOR FAIR GROWTH AND LONG-TERM GROWTH AND I WILL CONTINUE OUTLINING PLANS AND ALL OF THESE AREAS, FROM SETTING AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS, TO REINING IN EXCESSIVE RISK ON WALL STREET. TODAY, I WANT TO FOCUS IN PARTICULAR ON LONG-TERM GROWTH. CONSIDER THIS FACT. A SURVEY OF CORPORATE EXECUTIVES FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF WOULD HOLD OFF MAKING A SUCCESSFUL LONG-TERM INVESTMENT IF IT MEANT MISSING A TARGET IN THE NEXT QUARTERLY EARNINGS REPORT. IN ANOTHER RECENT SURVEY, MORE THAN 60% SAID THE PRESSURE TO PROVIDE SHORT-TERM RETURNS HAD INCREASED OVER THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS. WE ALSO KNOW PUBLICLY HELD COMPANIES FACING PRESSURE FROM SHAREHOLDERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO INVEST IN GROWTH THE CON -- CHIPOTLE. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR BURRITO BOWLS. LAST MONTH, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT WOULD HAVE PAID SICK DAYS, PAID VACATION TIME, AND REIMBURSEMENT TO ITS PART-TIME EMPLOYEES. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE ALL SMART, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WILL AND DO PAY OFF FOR COMPANIES, WORKERS, AND OUR SOCIETY. THEY POINT TO AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY. HOW DO WE DEFINE SHAREHOLDER VALUE IN THE 21ST CENTURY? IS IT MAXIMIZING IMMEDIATE RETURNS, OR DELIVERING LONG-TERM GROWTH? OF COURSE, WE WANT TO DO BOTH. BUT TODAY, TOO OFTEN, THE FORMER COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE LATTER. REAL VALUE IS LASTING VALUE. WE ALL KNOW THAT IN OUR OWN LIVES. I LEARNED IT WATCHING MY FATHER SWEPT OVER THE PRINTING TABLE IN HIS SMALL FABRIC SHOP IN CHICAGO. HE'S THERE AND -- HE SAVED TO PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILIES FUTURE. IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO BE SECURE FOR TODAY. WHAT MATTERED WAS TOMORROW. WHAT IS TRUE IN LIFE IS ALSO TRUE IN BUSINESS. REAL VALUE COMES FROM LONG-TERM GROWTH, NOT SHORT-TERM PROFITS. IT COMES FROM BUILDING COMPANIES, NOT STRIPPING THEM. FROM CREATING GOOD JOBS, NOT ELIMINATING THEM. FROM SEEING WORKERS AS ASSETS TO CULTIVATE, NOT COSTS TO BE CUT. AMERICAN BUSINESS NEEDS TO BREAK FREE FROM THE TYRANNY OF TODAY'S EARNINGS REPORTS SO THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY DO BEST. INNOVATE, INVEST, AND BUILT TOMORROW'S PROSPERITY. IT'S TIME TO START MEASURING VALUE IN TERMS OF YEARS FOR THE NEXT DECADE, NOT JUST THE NEXT QUARTER. THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS WE CAN RAISE INCOME, HELP FAMILIES GET AHEAD, AND DELIVER REAL VALUE FOR SHAREHOLDERS. NOW THERE'S NO SINGLE CAUSE OF QUARTERLY CAPITALISM, THEREFORE NO SINGLE SOLUTION. BUT THERE ARE PARTS, SPECIFIC REFORMS THAT CAN BE MADE BY BOTH THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR THAT WOULD BETTER ALIGN MARKET INCENTIVES FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH. REFORMS THAT MANY FORWARD THINKING BUSINESS LEADERS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR. I WILL MENTION FIVE AREAS OF FOCUS TODAY. BUT THIS LIST SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE DISCUSSION, NOT THE END. FIRST, I'M PROPOSING A REFORM OF TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS. THE PROFITS EARNED BY THE SALE OF STOCK AND OTHER ASSETS. TO PROMOTE AND REWARD INVESTMENT. THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF A LONG-TERM HOLDING PERIOD, JUST ONE YEAR, IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. THAT MAY COUNT AS LONG-TERM FOR MY BABY GRANDDAUGHTER, BUT NOT FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. IT'S NO WAY TO RUN A TAX SYSTEM. AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD MOVE TO A SIX-YEAR SLIDING SCALE THAT PROVIDES REAL INCENTIVES FOR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. FOR TAXPAYERS IN THE TOP BRACKET, FAMILIES EARNING MORE THAN $465,000 A YEAR, ANY GAINS FROM SELLING STOCK IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS WOULD BE TAXED JUST LIKE ORDINARY INCOME. THEN THE RATE WOULD DECREASE EACH YEAR UNTIL IT RETURNS TO THE CURRENT RATE. THIS MEANS THAT FROM THE MOMENT INVESTORS BUY INTO A COMPANY, THEY WILL BE MORE FOCUSED ON ITS FUTURE GROWTH STRATEGY THAN ITS IMMEDIATE PROFIT. SO WILL SOME EXECUTIVES WHO ARE PAID IN PART WITH STOCK OR STOCK OPTIONS. I WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT WAYS TO ADDRESS VERY SHORT TERM TRADING. WHETHER IT IS CONDUCTED OVER DAYS, HOURS, OR EVEN MILLISECONDS. WE SHOULD OFFER THE CHANCE TO ELIMINATE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ALTOGETHER FOR CERTAIN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SMALL BUSINESSES, INCLUDING INNOVATIVE STARTUPS AND HARD-HIT COMMUNITIES, FROM INNER CITIES, TO CALL COUNTRY, TO INDIAN COUNTRY. -- TO CAOLOAL COUNTRY. THIS SHOULD GO HAND-IN-HAND WITH A REAL EXPANDED TAX CODE WHICH ENCOURAGES INVESTMENT IMPORT OR REMOTE COMMUNITIES AND HELPS PREVENT DOWNWARD SPIRALS AFTER ECONOMIC DISRUPTION, LIKE PLANT CLOSINGS OR LAYOFFS. I WANT TO SEE MORE INVESTORS HELPING UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS THAT IS STRUGGLING TO GET BACK ON ITS FEET. O'ER THE STARTUP THAT IS ON THE VERGE OF MAKING IT BIG. OR THE COMMUNITY THAT LOST THE FACTORY WHERE GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES WORKED, BUT NOW IS EAGER TO BUILD A NEW FUTURE. THAT IS LONG-TERM GROWTH AT ITS BEST. NOW OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND THESE CHANGES TO THE TAX CODE ALONE WILL NOT SHIFT INVESTOR'S FOCUS FROM SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM OVERNIGHT. BUT I BELIEVE THIS REFORM IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO REMOVING SOME OF THE INCENTIVES THAT PUSH US TOWARDS QUARTERLY CAPITALISM. THIS WOULD BE PART OF A BROADER REFORM OF BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE TAXES THAT I WILL BE DISCUSSING LATER IN THE CAMPAIGN. LATSST WEEK, I CALLED FOR CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE AND INCREMENTING THE BUFFET RULE, WHICH MAJOR CLEANERS DON'T PLATE ROLLER MAKES VENDOR SECRETARY. -- WHICH MAKES SURE THEY DON'T PAY LOWER RATES THAN IN THEIR SECRETARIES. THE SECOND AREA WHERE ACTION IS NEEDED IS TO ADDRESS THE INFLUENCE OF INCREASINGLY ASSERTIVE SHAREHOLDERS, DETERMINED TO EXTRACT MAXIMUM PROFIT IN THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF THE FUTURE GROWTH. SO-CALLED ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERS CAN'T HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON COMPANIES. IT'S A GOOD THING WHEN INVESTORS PUT PRESSURE ON MANAGEMENT TO STAY NIMBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE, OR PRESS FOR SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS. BUT THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THESE HIT-AND-RUN ACTIVIST, WHOSE GOAL IS TO FORCE IN IMMEDIATE PAYOUT, NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT DISCOURAGES AND DISTRACTS MANAGEMENT FROM PURSUING STRATEGIES THAT WOULD ADD THE MOST LONG-TERM VALUE FOR THE COMPANY. EVEN ICONIC BUSINESSES LIKE APPLE OR PROCTOR AND GAMBLE HAVE FELT THIS PRESSURE. WE NEED A NEW GENERATION OF COMMITTED, LONG-TERM INVESTORS TO PROVIDE A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE HIT AND RUN ACTIVISTS. SOME INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALREADY ARE BEGINNING TO PUSH BACK. WE NEED MORE PENSION FUNDS AND PROXY ADVISORY FIRMS TO DO SO AS WELL. INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS CONTROL 70% OF THE SHARES IN THE LARGEST 1000 U.S. COMPANIES. THEY HAVE UNMATCHED INFLUENCE, AND THEREFORE, AND UNMATCHED OBLIGATION TO GUIDE COMPANIES TOWARDS STRATEGIES AND METRICS FOCUSED ON LONG-TERM VALUE. THERE ARE THINGS GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO AS WELL. AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD ORDER A FULL REVIEW OF REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM, SOME OF WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN RE-EXAMINED IN DECADES. LET ALONE MODERNIZED TO REFLECT CHANGING REALITIES IN OUR ECONOMY. WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT STOCK BUYBACKS. INVESTORS AND REGULATORS LIKE IGNORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE TRANSACTIONS. CAPITAL MARKETS WORK OUT WHEN INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO ALL. PLACES LIKE THE U.K. AND HONG KONG REQUIRE COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE STOCK BUYBACKS WITHIN ONE DAY. BUT HERE IN THE U.S., YOU CAN GO AN ENTIRE QUARTER WITHOUT DISCLOSING. SO LET'S CHANGE THAT. AND BUYBACKS READ DIRECTLY TO THE THIRD AREA OF FOCUS. REFORMING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. WE CANNOT ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE OF QUARTERLY CAPITALISM WITHOUT MAKING SURE THAT INCENTIVES FOR CEO'S AND OTHER EXECUTIVES OR MY FOCUSED ON THE LONG-TERM GROWTH AND STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY THEY RUN AND LESS ON THE SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATION IN ITS SHARE PRICE. I AM ALL FOR REWARDING CEO'S WELL WHEN THEIR COMPANIES PROSPER, AND THEIR EMPLOYEES ALSO SHARE IN THE REWARDS. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH SENIOR EXECUTIVES GETTING RICH FROM COMPANIES STUTTERING AND EMPLOYEES STRUGGLING. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN CORPORATE BOARDS ALLOW EXORBITANT PAY PACKAGES THAT AREN'T BASED ON CREDIBLE ASSESSMENTS OF EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE OR A COMPANY'S LONG-TERM INTEREST. 30 YEARS AGO, TOP CEOS MADE 50 TIMES WHAT TYPICAL WORKER DID. TODAY, THEY MAKE 300 TIMES MORE. THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF EXECUTIVES WERE JUST AS TALENTED AND HARD-WORKING, AND HE MANAGED TO GET BY WITH MUCH MORE REASONABLE COMPENSATION. SO HAVE CEOS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY AND OUR COUNTRY IF WE GET BACK TO COMPENSATING ALL EMPLOYEES WITH PRODUCTIVITY, NOT JUST TO THOSE AT THE TOP. IN THE 1990'S, THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO TIE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO COMPANY PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF STOCK OPTIONS. BUT MANY STOCK HEAVY PAY PACKAGES HAVE CREATED A PERVERSE INCENTIVE FOR EXECUTIVES TO SEEK THE BIG PAYOUTS THAT COULD COME FOR A TEMPORARY RISE IN SHARE PRICE. WE ENDED UP ENCOURAGING SOME OF THE SAME SHORT-TERM THINKING WE MEANT TO DISCOURAGE. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE DODD FRANK FINANCIAL REFORM LEGISLATION PASSED IN 2010 CALLED FOR NEW REGULATIONS REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, MANY RULES HAVE YET TO BE PUT IN PLACE. THAT INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT TO PUBLISH THE RATIO BETWEEN CEO PAY AND THE PAYCHECKS OF EVERYDAY EMPLOYEES. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR TAKING FIVE YEARS TO GET THIS DONE. WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHETHER EXECUTIVE PAY AT THEIR COMPANY HAS GOTTEN OUT OF BALANCE, AND SO DOES THE PUBLIC. WE NEED TO TAKE SEVERAL STEPS HERE. DEFEND THE DODD FRANK ACT, THE REPUBLICAN ATTACKS, AND FINALLY PROMISED RULES ON THE BOOKS. REFORM OF THE PERFORMANCE-BASED TAX-DEDUCTIBLE FOR TOP EXECUTIVES. EXPAND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SAY ON PAY RULE TO INCLUDE AN EXPEDITION OF HOW EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION WILL PROMOTE THE LONG-TERM HEALTH OF THE COMPANY. NOW A CRUCIAL FOURTH AREA OF REFORM IS HOW WORKERS ARE SEEN AS THE ENGINES OF GROWTH AS THEY ARE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WELL-PAID AND WELL-TRAINED EMPLOYEES TEND TO WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY, STAY ON THE JOB LONGER, AND PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. BUT THOSE REWARDS CAN BE HARDER TO MEASURE THEN THE IMMEDIATE COSTS OF PAYROLL AND TRAINING. SO UNDER THE PRESSURE OF QUARTERLY CAPITALISM, THEY ARE OFTEN SQUANDERED. EMPLOYER FUNDED JOB TRAINING HAS FALLEN BY MORE THAN ONE THIRD IN THE PAST TWO DECADES, EVEN AS THE PREMIUM ON SKILLED WORKERS HAS INCREASED IN A COMPETITIVE LEVEL ECONOMY. EVEN WHERE TRAINING PROGRAMS DO EXIST, TOO FEW ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BROADLY APPLICABLE SECTORAL SKILLS. THE DECLINE OF UNIONS AND WORKER BARGAINING POWER HAS LED TO A DECLINE IN WORKER VOICES, IN LONG-TERM DECISION-MAKING AT MANY COMPANIES. IT SNOWS APPRISE THAT WE HAVE SEEN -- IT IS NO SURPRISE WE HAVE SEEN CORPORATE INVESTMENT IN HUMAN CAPITAL DECLINE AS WELL. WE NEED TO START REVERSE ALL OF THESE TRENDS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT TO DEFEND WORKERS RIGHTS AND ENCOURAGE MORE COMPANIES TO INVEST IN THEIR EMPLOYEES. IN HIS CAMPAIGN, IPARTY PROPOSED -- INTO THIS CAMPAIGN, I HAVE ALREADY PROPOSED A PACKAGE FOR EVERY NEW WORKER THAT BUSINESSES TRAIN AND HIGHER, AS WELL AS A PLAN TO ENCOURAGE MORE COMPANIES TO OFFER MORE GENEROUS PROFIT-SHARING PROGRAMS. I'VE ALSO CALLED FOR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE AND INCREMENTING PRESENT OBAMA'S NEW RULE ON OVERTIME. LET ME ADD, I AGREE WITH NEW YORK'S PROPOSAL TO RAISE WAGES FOR FAST FOOD WORKERS TO $15 AN HOUR. THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE NEEDS TO BE RAISED. LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THAT THE COST OF LIVING IN MANHATTAN IS DIFFERENT THAN IN LITTLE ROCK AND OTHER PLACES. SO NEW YORK OR LOS ANGELES OR SEATTLE ARE RIGHT TO GO HIGHER. WE ARE GOING TO ASK THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST IN THE LONG-TERM, LET'S ALSO FACE UP TO THE FACT THAT WASHINGTON MAY WELL BE THE WORST OFFENDER OF ALL WHEN IT COMES TO SHORT-TERM THINKING. THIS IS THE FIFTH AREA OF REFORM THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. IT IS TIME TO AND THE -- END THE ERA OF BUDGET BRINKSMANSHIP AND STOP CAREENING FROM ONE SELF-INFLICTED CRISIS TO ANOTHER. [APPLAUSE] THAT JUST CREATES MORE IN CERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES, FOR INVESTORS, AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN ASKING A LOT OF BUSINESS LEADERS WHOM I HAVE TALKED TO, WHAT ARE A COUPLE THINGS WOULD LOVE TO SEE HAPPEN? ALMOST TO A PERSON, WE'LL ALWAYS SAY, WE NEED MORE PARTICULARLY. WE CAN DEAL WITH WHATEVER DOES COME OUT OF WASHINGTON, BUT WHEN IT DOESN'T COME, WHEN THERE ARE STALEMATES OR GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, THAT INTERFERES WITH OUR BUSINESS. AND PARTICULARLY, WITHOUT GLOBAL BUSINESS -- WITH OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS. THAT IS AN OBVIOUS THING TO SAY, BUT I HOPE THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WILL PAY ATTENTION. LET'S STOP POURING SUBSIDIES INTO INDUSTRIES THAT ARE ALREADY THRIVING, LIKE THE GIVEAWAYS IN THE TAX CODE TO OIL COMPANIES. [APPLAUSE] START INVESTING IN THE FUTURE TO CREATE MILLIONS MORE NEW JOBS IN THE NEW ECONOMY. WE SHOULD BE MAKING SMART INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, INNOVATION, EDUCATION, AND CLEAN ENERGY THAT WILL HELP BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS GROW AND CREATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS. WE KNOW THE INVESTMENT THAT WOULD BE MADE IN THESE AREAS HAVE VERY HIGH RETURNS. THERE IS NO EXCUSE NOT TO MAKE THEM, AND TO MAKE THEM NOW. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SHOULD IMPROVE AND MAKE PERMANENT THE RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE ASIAN TAX CREDIT. -- EXPERIMENTATION TAX CREDIT. EVERY YEAR, CONGRESS HAS ANOTHER SQUABBLE OVER TO RENEW DISCREDIT. THEY HAVE DONE IT 16 TIMES IN THE PAST 35 YEARS. ISN'T IT TIME WE STOP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND ACTUALLY GET DOWN TO DOING PEOPLE'S BUSINESS? AS IMPORTANT AS THE SPECIFIC REFORMS I HAVE OUTLINED ARE, THE TRUTH IS THAT TO FIGHT AGAINST QUARTERLY CAPITALISM CANNOT BE WON IN WASHINGTON ALONE. THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGE. WE ARE ALREADY SEEING A MOVEMENT FOR CHANGE TAKING SHAPE. INVESTORS, EXECUTIVES, AND EMPLOYEES ARE ALL STARTING TO STEP UP. UNION LEADERS ARE INVESTING THEIR OWN PENSION FUNDS IN PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK TO BUILD TOMORROW'S CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. THEY EARN A GOOD RETURNS DOING THAT. WE NEED TO BUILD ON THIS MOMENTUM. IT'S TIME TO RETURN TO AN OLD FASHIONED IDEA. THAT COMPANIES RESPONSE ABILITIES TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS ALSO ENCOMPASSES A RESPONSIBILITY TO EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, COMMUNITIES, AND ULTIMATELY TO OUR COUNTRY, AND YES, OUR PLANET. [APPLAUSE] THE STRENGTH AND LEGITIMACY OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED ON ITS ABILITY TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES, TO GET AHEAD GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. I'M PLEASED THAT SENSE 2010, 31 STATES HAVE INVADED -- ENACTED LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING SO-CALLED BENEFIT RATIONS, -- BENEFIT CORPORATIONS, WHICH ALLOW IS MRS. TO PURSUE -- ALLOW BUSINESSES TO PURSUE-- THAT HAS REAL MERIT, AND WE SHOULD EXPLORE IT FURTHER. WHAT IS GOOD FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES ALSO HAPPENS TO BE GOOD ECONOMICS. WE KNOW THAT A STRONG, SUSTAINABLE GROWTH CAN HELP ME HAPPENED WHEN COMMUNITIES ARE THRIVING AND WORKERS ARE WELL-PAID. AFTER ALL, OUR ECONOMY IS A 70% CONCEPTION ECONOMY. IT IS THE OLD HENRY FORD STORY, WHEN HE DECIDED HE WOULD BE PAYING HIS WORKERS, AS I RECALLED, THE PRINCELY SUM FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. A LOT OF HIS PEERS REALLY ROSE UP IN OPPOSITION. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? YOU'RE GOING TO THROW OFF THE LABOR MARKET, YOU'RE SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE. HIS RESPONSE WAS, I AM BUILDING THESE CARS, FUNNY PEOPLE TO BUY THEM. -- I NEED PEOPLE TO BUY THEN. OUR ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PUTTING PAYCHECKS IN ENOUGH AMERICANS SO THAT THEY CAN REFUEL THIS ECONOMY WHICH NOT ONLY HOLDS UP THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, BUT HOLDS UP THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. IT IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST, INCLUDING CORPORATE AMERICA'S, TO CONTRIBUTE TO A VIBRANT MIDDLE CLASS AND RISING INCOMES. NOW AS PRESIDENT, I WON'T TRY TO IMPOSE A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL SOLUTION. BUT I WILL USE THE CONVENING POWER OF THE OFFICE TO BRING ALL RELEVANT PARTIES TOGETHER TO HELP MOVE OUR CORPORATE CULTURE TOWARDS SOLID, LONG-TERM GROWTH AND INVESTMENT. JUST IMAGINE HOW DIFFERENT OUR HISTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF SHORT-TERM-ISM HAD DOMINATED EARLIER ERAS THE WAY IT DOES TODAY. WHAT IF AN ACTIVIST HEDGE FUND HAD PERSUADED AT&T TO MAXIMIZE CASH FLOW AND CLOSE BELL LABS BEFORE THE TRANSISTOR, OR THE LASER WAS INVENTED? WHAT IF XEROX HAD DECIDED THAT IT PALO ALTO RESEARCH FIRM WASN'T DOING ENOUGH TO BOOST SHARE PRICES IN THE SHORT TERM? A YOUNG STEVE JOBS WOULD NEVER HAVE VISITED, AND THE PERSONAL COMPUTER REVOLUTION MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED. WOULD'VE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET CUTS HAD SHUT DOWN DARPA, THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECT AGENCY, BEFORE IT DEVELOPED THE EARLY INTERNET? TODAY, WE FACE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE FUTURE AND THE PAST. REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SEEM TOTALLY UNCONCERNED ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF QUARTERLY CAPITALISM. IN FACT, THEIR POLICIES WOULD MAKE IT WORSE. MOST WOULD ELIMINATE CAPITAL GAINS FOR WEALTHY INVESTORS WITH NO INCENTIVES FOR LONG-TERM HOLDING. THEY WOULD WIPE OUT THE NEW RULES ON WALL STREET, IMPOSED AFTER THE CRISIS. AND OF COURSE, THEY WOULD FURTHER STRIP WORKER RIGHTS AND WE CAN BARGAINING POWER. -- WEAKEN BARGAINING POWER. THEIR APPROACH TO GOVERNMENT MIRRORS THE WORST TENDENCIES OF HIT-AND-RUN SHAREHOLDERS, DEMANDING QUICK PAYOUTS IN THE FORM OF TAX BREAKS TO THE WEALTHY AT THE EXPENSE OF INVESTING IN THE FUTURE. THEY IGNORE LONG-TERM CHALLENGES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE, POVERTY AND INEQUALITY, FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST LOOK AT THE CURRENT MESS IN CONGRESS WITH THE HIGHWAY BILL. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO RETURN TO STAYING OUT OF TOUCH, OUT OF DATE POLICIES THAT HAVE WRECKED OUR ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO DRIVE STRONG GROWTH, THEIR GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. -- FAIR GROWTH. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL RENEW THE BASIC BARGAIN OF AMERICA. YOU KNOW IT. IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU SHOULD BE EVIL TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. WHEN YOU DO -- YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK HARD AND STAY AHEAD. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BUILD AN ECONOMY FOR TOMORROW, NOT JUST TODAY. I INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME IN THIS DISCUSSION. I AM LOOKING FOR NEW, CREATIVE, INNOVATIVE, DISRUPTIVE IDEAS THAT WILL SAVE CAP THEM -- SAVE CAPITALISM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. BECAUSE IT IS THE GREATEST ENGINE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND POTENTIAL THAT'S EVER BEEN INVENTED. IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC HISTORY THAT CREATED THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT SO MANY GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AND THAT LED TO THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC CONFERENCE OF OUR COUNTRY. -- A COMPLIMENTS --- ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF OUR COUNTRIES. AND LIKE IN PREVIOUS ERAS, IT NEEDS TO BE REINVENTED, PUT BACK TO BALANCE. IT NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE REALLY ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. THE BETTER WE ALL DO, THE MORE THERE WILL BE FOR EVERYBODY. TO INVEST IN, TO PROFIT FROM. SO I ASK YOU, IN PARTICULARLY HERE, THE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND OTHERS WHO ARE STUDYING BUSINESS, HELP US THINK THROUGH THE BEST WAYS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE, TO MOVE IT BACK TO WHERE IT USED TO BE, WHICH WAS MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON LONG-TERM INVESTING. WITH THE RESULTS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PROSPERITY THAT WE ENJOYED FOR DECADES. WITH NEW CHALLENGES FROM TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBALIZATION AND OTHER BIG PROBLEMS ON THE HORIZON LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE BEST AT DOING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE PROBLEM SOLVERS, NOT PROBLEM DENIERS. WE ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, WE GET TO WORK, AND WE KEEP MOVING FORWARD. IT IS ALWAYS ALL ABOUT TOMORROW. LOVE THAT SONG, DON'T STOP THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW. [LAUGHTER] SO HELP ME THINK ABOUT IT, AND LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327572-1/hillary-clinton-remarks-college-affordability,Hillary Clinton Remarks on College Affordability,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"HILLARY CLINTON ON THE PLAN TO ADDRESS STUDENT LOAN DEBT WHICH INCLUDES REFINANCING OPTIONS. SHE SPOKE AT EXETER HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] >> HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS IS VERY EXCITING FOR ALL OF US. I HATE TO SLOW YOUR APPLAUSE. HELLO. GOOD TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TO EXETER HIGH SCHOOL. MY NAME IS ALEXIS SIMPSON AND I'M A STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM HERE IN EXETER. [APPLAUSE] REP. SIMPSON: IS MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO OUR HOME EXETER AND I WILL ASK YOU IF YOU ARE ABLE TO RISE AND WE WILL SAY THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TOGETHER. >> I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. REP. SIMPSON: PLEASE BE SEATED. BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH TODAY'S TOWNHALL -- I ALREADY SAID OF THAT. WE ARE PARTICULARLY GLAD TO WELCOME SECRETARY CLINTON BACK TO OUR COMMUNITY TODAY. TO DISCUSS HER COLLEGE COMPACT. COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IS AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SALLY -- RALLIES IN PROFOUND WAYS. NEW HAMPSHIRE IS WHAT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF STUDENT DEBT IN THE COUNTRY. OUR STEWS GRADUATE WITH ON AVERAGE 33,000 AND STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AS I SAID EARLIER I AM A STATE REPRESENTATIVE BUT I AM ALSO A MOM TO 2 THE YOUNG BOYS HERE IN EXETER. AS A LEGISLATOR, I'VE BEEN EXAMINED THIS ISSUE AND WORKING WITH WASTE WITHDRAWS THE PROBLEM. AS A PARENT IT IS FRIGHTENING TO ME. I JUST FINISHED PAYING OFF MY OWN STUDENT LOANS. [APPLAUSE] REP. SIMPSON: THAT IS WORTH A LITTLE CLOUT. -- CLAP. WHEN THAT TIME COMES FOR MY BOYS GOING TO COLLEGE, THEY GO FACE THE PROCESS THAT OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT BEFORE THEY RECEIVE THEIR DIPLOMA. HILLARY UNDERSTANDS THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES TRUE LEADERSHIP. THAT IS WHY SHE AND HER TOP POLICY ADVISERS HAVE MADE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND SOLVING THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS A PRIORITY. SHE IS HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU , FAMILIES OF THE GRANITE STATE, FULFILL THIS PARTICULAR ECONOMIC ISSUE ACUTELY. SHE HAS A PLAN TO TOPPLE THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND HELP REDUCE THE BURDEN OF DEBT ON OUR STUDENTS. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO BE THE CHAMPION THAT FAMILIES LIKE MINE AND MANY OF YOURS NEED IN ORDER TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. [APPLAUSE] REP. SIMPSON: BEFORE WE HEAR FROM SECRETARY CLINTON HERSELF, DAN TORREY IN THE MIDST OF THE STRUGGLE TO PAY DOWN HIS STUDENT LOANS WILL SPEAK. LET'S WELCOME DAN. [APPLAUSE] DAN: HEY, EVERYBODY. I HOPE YOU ARE EX I DID. I AM EXCITED. MY NAME IS DAN AND I'M A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I WILL BE A SENIOR. I STUDIED POLITICAL SCIENCE THERE. I COME FROM A HUMBLE BACKGROUND. MY DAD IS THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND HAS BEEN SINCE ASPHALT. MY MOM IS IN A COUNCIL -- ACCOUNTANTS. -- AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. WE HAVE A PROBLEM. OUR PROBLEM IS THAT ME AND MY SISTER, IT WILL BE A STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR EDUCATION. I AM WORKING THREE JOBS MY SUMMER TO PAY DEBT AND HELP MY FAMILY BECAUSE WE WORK AS A TEAM FOR THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN OUR HOUSE. WE CAN BARELY AFFORD IT NOW AND IT WILL BE A STRUGGLE WHEN MY SISTER HAS TO GO TO SCHOOL. WE ARE REALLY EXCITED THAT A LOT OF THE CANDIDATES THIS TIME AROUND, HILLARY SEEMS LIKE SHE WILL DO THE MOST FOR US AND TRYING TO FIGHT STUDENT LOANS COSTS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SUMMER THAT IT DOES NOT -- DOES NOT COME EASY I THINK IS DEDICATING A LOT OF MY TIME, ANY SPARE TIME, TO VOLUNTEERING FOR THE CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] DAN: FIGHTING FOR EVERY DAY TO HELP SOLVE ISSUES FOR MY FAMILY BECAUSE I AM NOT CONTENT WITH THE STATUS QUO WE HAVE NOW AND I WILL PRICES TO GO DOWN. PLEASE HELP ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: OH, WOW. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I THOUGHT DAN DID A GREAT JOB. AND THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING FOR SO MANY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES MORE HARD-WORKING AND DEDICATED AND DESERVE TO GO AS FAR AS THE THAT AMBITION AND EFFORT OF YOURS WILL TAKE YOU. WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR SISTER, AND THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. LET ME THANK REPRESENTATIVE ALEXIS SIMPSON FOR HER INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I LOVED IT WHEN SHE SAID I AM A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, A MOM WITH 2 BOYS AND I JUST PAID OFF MY STUDENT LOAN. I KNOW THAT IS TRUE FOR SO MANY YOUNG COUPLES AND FAMILIES. AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES BUT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO BE SO HARD THAT THE DEBT THEY CARRY INTERFERES WITH THEM ABLE TO START A SMALL BUSINESS OR BUY A HOME OR GET MARRIED WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS THE CASE TODAY. I WANTED TO RECOGNIZE STATE REP PATTY LOVEJOY. WILL YOU STAND UP? THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND EXECUTIVE COUNSELOR OSTERN. WHERE IS COLLIN? HE WORKS ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUES. GREAT TO BE BACK IN EXETER AND AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE FROM DOVER TO NASHUA TO WINDOW AND PEOPLE EVERYWHERE ASK A GREAT QUESTIONS. I THINK IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE YOU LIVE AND THE FIRST PRIMARY STATE. AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY ASKED ME ALL THE TIME IS ABOUT AFFORDING COLLEGE AND BEING ABLE TO PAY BACK THE LOANS THEY TAKE OUT IN ORDER TO GO TO COLLEGE. NOW, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE CHOICES WE MAKE AS A COUNTRY. AND THOSE CHOICES WILL SHAPE OUR FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN AMERICA, IF YOU WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT'S THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT IS ALWAYS SET OUR COUNTRY APART. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE STRENGTHEN THAT BARGAIN AND IT HOLDS TRUE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT. THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA, OUR COUNTRY HAS COME BACK FROM THE WORST RECESSION OF OUR LIFETIMES. WE ARE STANDING AGAIN BUT WE ARE NOT RUNNING THE WAY WE SHOULD. CORPORATE POCKETS ARE NEAR DEATH PROFITS ARE NEAR RECORD HIGHS BUT MOST PAYCHECKS HAVE BOUGHT -- BARELY BUDGE. COSTS FOR BASICALLY EVERYTHING HAS ALSO GONE UP. AS THEY ARE RISING FASTER THAN WAGES. NO WONDER THEN MANY AMERICANS FEEL THE DECK IS STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP. WITH GOT TO DO BETTER AND WE HAVE TO GET INCOME RISES AGAIN SO MORE HARD-WORKING FAMILIES CAN AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. THAT IS THE CENTRAL ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME AND IT WILL BE MY MISSION EVERY DAY THAT I SERVE AS PRESIDENT. WE NEED STRONG GROWTH. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: WE NEED STRONG GROWTH, FAIR GROWTH, LONG-TERM GROWTH AND WE WANT A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY THAT A SHARED BY ALL. WORKS FOR EVERYONE. TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS WE CAN EASE THE BURDEN ON FAMILIES. AND ONE OF THE SINGLE BIGGEST WAYS WE CAN ACTUALLY RAISE INCOME. BY MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO EVERY AMERICAN. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, A COLLEGE DEGREE HAS BEEN THE TICKET TO A BETTER LIFE. MY GRANDFATHER WORKED HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND THE LACE MILLS. HE RETIRED AT 65. HE ALWAYS BELIEVED BY WORKING THAT HARD, ALL OF THOSE HOURS THAT LIFE WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIS CHILDREN. AND MY DAD MADE IT TO COLLEGE, MADE IT TO PENN STATE. MADE IT TO THE FOOTBALL TEAM BACK IN THE 1930'S. AND THEN WHEN HE GOT OUT, HE WAS ABLE TO START HIS OWN SMALL BUSINESS. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE'S GRANTED HE'S SAVED AND IT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. THEN MY PARENTS SAVED FOR YEARS FOR COLLEGE. THEY KNEW THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE WAYS THEY COULD SET TO ME ON A PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE. COLLEGE STILL HOLDS THAT PROMISE. A LOT HAS CHANGED IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THAT HASN'T. PARENTS WHO NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO GO TO COLLEGE THEMSELVES LIKE MY MOTHER DREAM OF SEEING THEIR CHILDREN GET THAT DEGREE LITERALLY FROM THE MOMENT THEY'RE BORN. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE HOPING FOR. THEY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION. HIGH-SCHOOLERS EVEN MIDDLE-SCHOOLERS ARE TAKING COLLEGE PREP COURSE AND SOME ARE STUDYING FOR THE SAT. FULL-TIME WORKERS ARE TAKING COURSES ONLINE, EVEN IF THAT MEANS HEADING STRAIGHT FROM AN EIGHT-HOUR SHIFT TO A PILE OF HOMEWORK. IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A BETTER JOB TO GIVE THEIR KIDS BETTER THAN THEY HAD, THEN THEY'LL DO IT. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM. STATES ARE SLASHING EDUCATION BUDGETS. AND COLLEGES KEEP RAISING PRICES. IN-STATE TUITION AND FEES FOR PUBLIC COLLEGES INCREASED BY 42% BETWEEN 2004 AND 2014. WHO'S INCOMES WERE RAISED BY 42%? SO FAMILIES ARE LEFT FACING A PAINFUL CHOICE. EITHER THEY SAY, ""WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT,"" AND PASS UP ON ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT A DEGREE OFFERS OR THEY DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PAY FOR IT, EVEN IF THAT MEANS GOING DEEPLY INTO DEBT. NOW, FOR MOST PEOPLE, THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF A COLLEGE DEGREE IS STILL WORTH IT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. ON AVERAGE, PEOPLE WITH FOUR-YEAR DEGREES EARN OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS MORE OVER THEIR CAREERS THAN PEOPLE WITH HIGH SCHOOL DEGREES. BUT STUDENT DEBT IS INCREASINGLY HOLDS PEOPLE BACK. 40 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE STUDENT LOANS. TOGETHER, THEY OWE $1.2 TRILLION. A NEW HAMPSHIRE CARRIES ONE OF THE HIGHEST DEBT TO LOWE'S IN THE COUNTRY. AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE DELINQUENT OR IN DEFAULT. EVEN IF THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP. ,I WAS TALKING TO SOME YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE I CAME OUT AND ONE WAS SAYING, IT IS A REAL STRETCH. I HOPE I NEVER GET SICK. I HOPE I DO NOT GET A LAID OFF. I HOPE THERE IS NOT A FAMILY EMERGENCY. YES, PEOPLE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PAY THOSE LOANS BUT SOMETIMES LIFE AND FATE INTERVENED. THE COST OF THIS DEBT IS REAL AND NOT JUST ON BALANCE SHEETS, BUT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FUTURES. WHEN I TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY SAY THEY PUT OFF BUYING A HOUSE OR CHANGING JOBS, OR STARTING A BUSINESS. A WOMAN CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN MASSACHUSETTS SO SHE COMMUTES 2 HOURS AND LIVES WITH HER PARENTS. SHE CANNOT MAKE IT WORK TO HAVE THE JOB, STARTED OFF HER CAREER AND PAYING BACK HER DAD. I'VE MET PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHO'VE CO-SIGNED LOANS AND END UP DRAINING THEIR SAVINGS OR RUINING THEIR CREDIT BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO HELP THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR AN EXPENSIVE DEGREE FROM A FOR-PROFIT INSTITUTION, ONLY TO FIND LITTLE SUPPORT ONCE THEY ACTUALLY ENROLL, OR THEY GRADUATE AND WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING THE JOB THEY WERE PROMISED, THEIR DEGREE IS NOT WORTH WHAT THEY THOUGHT. THEN THERE IS STILL TO START COLLEGE BUT NEVER FINISH. THEY'RE LEFT WITH DEBT AND NO DEGREE TO SHOW FOR IT. THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS. OVER 40% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS STILL HAVEN'T GRADUATED AFTER SIX YEARS AND MANY NEVER DO. IT'S TIME TO SHOW SOME TOUGH LOVE TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT LET SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF STUDENTS FALL BEHIND AND DROP OUT, YEAR AFTER YEAR. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE -- COLLEGE IS SUPPOSED TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS. BUT MORE AND MORE, PAYING FOR COLLEGE ACTUALLY PUSHES THOSE DREAMS FURTHER OUT OF REACH. THAT IS UP A TRAIL OF EVERYTHING COLLEGE IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT. IT IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AMERICA CREATES THE GREATEST WORKFORCE AND THE WORLD IN THIS CENTURY JUST LIKE WE DID IN THE LAST CENTURY. THE REST OF THE WORLD, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT IS WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN TO OUTDO US. CHINA'S OWN A PATH TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN COLLEGE BY 2030, WHICH MEANS THEY'LL HAVE NEARLY 200 MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATES. MORE THAN OUR ENTIRE WORKFORCE. I BELIEVE AMERICAN WORKERS CAN OUT-WORK AND OUT-INNOVATE ANYONE IN THE WORLD. IS GIVEN THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS WHY I AM PROPOSING IT IS TIME FOR NEW COLLEGE COMPACT WERE EVERYONE DOES THEIR PART. WE NEED TO MAKE A QUALITY EDUCATION AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WILLING TO WORK FOR IT WITHOUT SADDLING THEM WITH THE DECADES OF DEBT. AS I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH PEOPLE, I HAVE REACHED OUT TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS AND LEGISLATORS AND EXPERTS INCLUDING YOUNG PROGRESSIVE ACTIVISTS WHO POINT TO THE ISSUE OF DEBT-FREE COLLEGE AND AFFORDABILITY AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA. TODAY, I'M ANNOUNCING MY PLAN TO PUT COLLEGE WITHIN REACH FOR EVERYONE. WE'RE CALLING IT THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT. WE ARE POSTING IT ON OUR WEBSITE, FACEBOOK, SNAP CHAT, JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE WE CAN THINK OF. OR YOU CAN TEXT THE WORD ""COLLEGE"" TO THE NUMBER TO LEARN MORE AND I HOPE YOU WILL CHECK IT OUT. FOR NOW, HERE ARE THE BASICS. UNDER THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT, NO STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO BORROW TO PAY TUITION AT A PUBLIC COLLEGE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO CONTROL THEIR COSTS AND SHOW MORE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THEIR STUDENTS. NO MORE 42% INCREASES OVER 10 YEARS, WAY ABOVE THE RATES OF INFLATION OF ANYTHING ELSE. STATES WILL HAVE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATION TO INVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE ITS INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION, AND WILL NOT PROFIT OFF STUDENT LOANS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON AND EVERYONE WHO ALREADY HAS STUDENT DEBT WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE IT AT LOWER RATES. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: NOW, THIS IS MY PLAN. I KNOW IT IS A VICIOUS BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE AMBITIOUS BECAUSE IT IS ACHIEVABLE AND WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT COMES DOWN TO TWO BIG GOALS. FIRST, WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT COST WON'T BE A BARRIER. UNDER MY PLAN, TUITION WILL BE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY FAMILY. STUDENT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TAKE OUT LOAN OR TUITION AT THEIR STATE'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. WE'LL MAKE SURE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES STEP UP TO HELP PAY THE COST, SO THE BURDEN DOESN'T FALL ON FAMILIES ALONE. BUT HERE IS AN IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL POINT I WANT TO UNDERSCORE ABOUT MY COMPACT. TUITION THESE DAYS IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM. THE COST OF LIVING AND ATTENDING COLLEGE HAS ALSO BEEN INCREASING. SO UNDER MY PLAN, STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR PELL GRANTS WILL BE FREE TO ALL TO USE THEM FOR LIVING EXPENSES AND MIDDLE-CLASS STUDENTS WILL HAVE AN EASIER TIME PAYING FOR LIVING EXPENSES AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: WE'RE ALSO GOING TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE. THAT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN WE ARE ADOPTING GET. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: IF STUDENTS START AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND TRANSFER TO A FOUR-YEAR SCHOOL, WE WILL MAKE SURE YOUR CREDITS COUNT YOUR TRANSITION IS SEAMLESS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND WE WANT MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OFFER TWO-YEAR DEGREES AND CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE VALUED BY EMPLOYER SO STUDENTS KNOW THAT, IF THEY DO THE WORK, THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE TO GET A GOOD JOB. WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE OF A SURVEY LOT OF VERY BRIGHT AND NEEDY STUDENTS. -- THEY SERVE A LOT OF VERY BRIGHT AND NEEDY STUDENTS. WE WILL OFFER SPECIAL HELP TO COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS, BECAUSE WHEN YOU HELP PARENTS GET AN EDUCATION, YOU'RE HELPING THEIR CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND WE'LL MAKE A PROMISE TO STUDENTS WHO PERFORM NATIONAL SERVICE. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND YEARS TUTORING AMERICA'S KIDS OR CLEANING UP OUR PARKS OR HELPING COMMUNITIES HIT BY DISASTERS, WE'LL GUARANTEE THAT YOU CAN ATTEND YOUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE DEBT-FREE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: SO THAT'S THE FIRST BIG GOAL. HERE'S THE SECOND -- WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT DEBT WON'T HOLD ANYONE BACK. FOR THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS INCLUDING MANY OF YOU LIVE ALREADY HAS STUDENT DEBT MY PLAN , WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO REFINANCE AT LOWER INTEREST RATES. IT JUST MAKES SENSE. IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE OR YOUR CAR LOAN, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: IT'S JUST WRONG THAT PEOPLE ARE LOCKED INTO COLLEGE LOANS AT 8%, 9%, EVEN 10% INTEREST. IF YOU DO END UP TAKING OUT A LOAN FOR EXAMPLE TO GO TO A PRIVATE COLLEGE, WE WILL CUT YOUR INTEREST RATES, SO THE GOVERNMENT NEVER MAKES A PROFIT OFF YOUR LOAN. WE'LL MAKE IT EASIER TO ENROLL IN INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT PROGRAMS, SO YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 10% OF WHAT YOU MAKE. AND YOUR DEBT -- YOUR DEBT WILL ONLY LAST FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME. IT WON'T HANG OVER YOUR HEAD FOREVER. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO HELP BORROWERS WHO ARE IN DEFAULT GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. TO ME TO THEIR OBLIGATION. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE MORE SKIN IN THE GAME. IF THEY LOAD STUDENTS UP WITH DEBT FOR PROGRAMS THAT DON'T LEAD TO GOOD-PAYING JOBS, IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE THE STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. ONES COLLEGES DESERVE SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THEY WILL HAVE TO FULFILL IT. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON BANK AND WE'LL CRACK DOWN ON PREDATORY SCHOOLS, LENDERS, AND BILL COLLECTORS. IF YOU DEFRAUD STUDENTS, OVERCHARGE VETERANS, OR MISLEAD BORROWERS, WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE AND STOP YOU. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE G.I. BILL SO MORE VETERANS CAN GET THEIR DEGREE -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COLLEGES SPEND FEDERAL DOLLARS ON THINGS THAT BENEFIT STUDENTS, LIKE TEACHING AND RESEARCH AND NOT MARKETING CAMPAIGNS OR BIG SALARIES FOR ADMINISTRATORS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND FINALLY I WANT TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION. PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY REBOOTING THEIR CAREERS THROUGH ONLINE PROGRAMS, YET MANY STUDENTS CAN'T USE FEDERAL STUDENT AID TO PAY FOR THEM. IF EARNING ONLINE BADGES, SPECIALIZATIONS, OR NANO-DEGREES HELPS PEOPLE IMPROVE THEIR JOB PROSPECTS, WE SHOULD BE MAKING THAT OPTION EASIER AND MORE AFFORDABLE. AND UNDER MY PLAN, MORE STUDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO USE STUDENT AID TO PAY FOR HIGH-QUALITY PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY ONLINE. AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT RULES ABOUT ACCREDITATION DON'T KEEP OUT PROMISING ONLINE EDUCATION COMPANIES. WE WANT TO KEEP QUALITY HIGH WITHOUT STIFLING INNOVATION. NOW, THE REASON I CALL THIS A COLLEGE COMPACT IS BECAUSE IT GOES BOTH WAYS. EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP. WE CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM OF RISING COSTS AND RISING DEBT JUST BY THROWING MORE MONEY AT THE PROBLEM. WE CAN'T EXPECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST TO PAY THE BILL FOR FREE. THAT'S NOT HOW AMERICA WORKS. STATES WILL HAVE TO START INVESTING IN EDUCATION AGAIN. COLLEGES WILL HAVE TO DO BETTER BY THEIR STUDENTS. AS STUDENTS WANT TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING 10 HOURS A WEEK, AMERICANS WILL HAVE TO WORK HARD TO PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH SCHOOL TO OUT LEARN AND OUTHUSTLED OUR COMPONENT -- COMPETITORS JUST LIKE WILL ALWAYS HAVE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS JUST COMMON SENSE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR PEOPLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN TALK ABOUT IMPROVING THE ECONOMY, HELPING INCOMES RISE, ASK OF THE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THE DEBT BURDEN THAT IS HOLDING TOO MANY AMERICANS BACK. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I WANT EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN AMERICA TO KNOW IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU CAN GET AHEAD AND I WANT AMERICA TO HAVE YOUR BACK JUST LIKE IT DID IN THE PAST AND LIKE SO MANY OF US BELIEVE. I HAD A LOAN TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. IT WAS A GOVERNMENT LOAN. IT WAS AT A VERY LOW INTEREST RATE AND I PAID IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF MY INCOME OVER TIME. SO DID MY HUSBAND. WE WORKED HARD AND ALL OF THE TIME, EXTRA JOBS, EXTRA OPPORTUNITIES TO EARN MONEY IN ORDER TO PAY OUR WAY. THAT HELP FROM OUR GOVERNMENT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I AM ASKING PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR PART. YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE YOUR CONTRIBUTION BUT WE SHOULD HAVE YOUR BACK. I WANT EVERY PARENT TO KNOW THAT KIDS -- HE IS OR HER CHILD CAN GET A DEGREE OR YOU CAN GET ONE YOURSELF. THAT IS THE COUNTRY I WANT TO HELP BUILD FOR THIS GENERATION AND ALL GENERATIONS TO COME. I LOVE FORWARD TO TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. WE HAVE A GOT FOLKS AND THE AUDIENCE WITH MICROPHONES. IF YOU RAISE YOUR HAND AND I CALLING YOU, THERE WILL BE A MICROPHONE OVER TO GET YOU. WHERE SHALL WE START? THERE IS A MAN IN THE RED SHIRT. YES, SIR. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE COLLEGE INITIATIVE. I KNOW EDUCATION HAS BEEN IMPORTANT TO YOU HERE AND AROUND THE GLOBE. RIGHT NOW, EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS A KEY PART MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO INTO THE FUTURE AND EVENTUALLY GO INTO COLLEGE. AROUND THE WORLD, 58 MILLION KIDS WHO CANNOT STEP FOOT INSIDE OF OUR GRADE SCHOOL. KIDS SUFFERING FROM MALNUTRITION. BODY IS NOT DEVELOPING PROPERLY. I WILL LOVE TO SEE AND ASKING YOU IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO LAUNCH IT AND INITIATIVE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD THAT WOULD FOCUS ON NUTRITION AND GETTING ALL KIDS IN PRESCHOOL AND GRADE SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. WELL -- THE ANSWER IS YES AND YES. THE FIRST YES IS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE HERE TO GET MORE CHILDREN PREPARED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IT BEFORE. BECAUSE WE CAN DO, EVERYTHING I OUTLINED AND GET MORE KIDS INTO AFFORDABLE COLLEGE AND GET AT THE DEBT LOAD DOWN AND WE COULD DO A LOT TO WORK WITH GREAT SCHOOLS LIKE THIS AND OTHERS TO HELP MORE SCHOOL -- STUDENTS SUCCEED. ZERO TO FIVE YEARS SET THE PATTERN INTO MANY KIDS COME TO SCHOOL BEHIND ALREADY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I AM SAYING JUST BECAUSE I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT IT AND I AM A NEW GRANDMOTHER AND READING THE TALKING AND SINGING TO CHARLOTTE. BRAIN RESEARCH SHOWS THAT. 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. AND KIDS STIMULATED, HAVE GOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS, WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE THE TIME AND ENERGY AND UNDERSTANDING TO HELP PREPARE THEIR OWN KIDS, THEY WILL DO WELL. WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH THAT BY THE TIME KIDS GET TO KINDERGARTEN, KIDS LIKE MY GRANDDAUGHTER WILL OF HER 30 MILLION MORE WORDS THAN CHILDREN FROM LESS ADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WILL LITERALLY START ON THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TEACHERS AND I HOPE WE HAVE A LOT OF TEACHERS HERE -- [LAUGHTER] HILLARY CLINTON: YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. YOU WILL DO YOUR VERY BEST AND THE CLASSROOM AND THE SCHOOL AND TRY TO HELP EVERY KID FULFILL HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE SUCCESSFUL IF WE HAD UNIVERSAL PRE-K A GOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD IN OUR COUNTRY. THE SECOND YES IS BOLD AS A FIRST LADY AND A SENATOR AS SECRETARY OF DATE, I WORKED ON THE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COUNTRY WHICH IS SUCH A GENEROUS COUNTRY DID WHAT WE COULD TO HELP THE SMALLEST, MOST VULNERA BLE OF CHILDREN AND WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS. WE HAVE MORE KIDS INTO SCHOOLS AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND CUT THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE AND WITH MADE PROGRESS. WE STILL HAVE TO MANY PLACES IN OUR WORLD WHERE KIDS DIE TOO YOUNG. WHERE THEY ARE STUNTED FROM POOR NUTRITION. AS THEY ARE NOT GIVEN ADEQUATE EDUCATION. I HAVE MADE THIS POINT. I WRITE ABOUT IN MY BOOK, I HAVE MADE IT IN MANY SPEECHES AROUND THE WORLD. I BELIEVE WHAT THE UNITED STATES DOES THROUGH OUR GOVERNMENT AND THROUGH OUR PHILANDERER THE AT FAITH COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUAL CHARITIES IS JUST ASTONISHING. YOU KNOW, WE ARE A GENEROUS, CARING NATION. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT REALLY HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE THE WORK THAT AMERICANS HAVE DONE AROUND THE WORLD. AND I STARTED A PROGRAM WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN SEE TO THE FUTURE AND A REPRESENTS MY VIEWS AND BECAME ONE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIGGEST INITIATIVES -- FEED THE FUTURE. IT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT TO HELP PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO FEED THEMSELVES AND CREATE A MARKET ECONOMY AROUND THOSE CROPS THAN TO ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PROVIDING EMERGENCY FOOD AID. WHAT WE DID WITH FEED THE FUTURE WAS TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO AFTER MALNUTRITION. WE STILL HAVE EMERGENCY HELP FOR MALNOURISHED CHILDREN. WE ARE DOING MORE TO HELP PEOPLE HAVE THE TOOLS TO HELP THEMSELVES AND THEIR KIDS. A PROBLEM YOU DID NOT MENTION THE BUT ONE I WILL THROW IN IS CLEAN WATER. WE HAVE ONE BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT ACCESS TO CLEAN, SAFE DRINKING WATER. THESE ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT CHARITABLE OPPORTUNITIES. ALSO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT COMPANIES IN AMERICA ARE REALLY GOOD AT KNOWING HOW TO DO THIS. IF WE CAN CONTINUE TO LINK OF OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS IN DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS, I THINK WE WILL GO FAR IN MEETING YOUR GOALS. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON RAN RIGHT THERE. HERE WE GO. >> I AM AN EDUCATOR. 13 YEAR PUBLIC EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. AND AS A NINTH GRADE TEACHER, I SEE KIDS COMING FROM EIGHTH GRADE WITHOUT HAVING THE SUMMER OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE VERY WORKING ON A SUMMER PROGRAM KEY KIDS ENGAGED -- KEEP KIDS ENGAGE AND ACTIVE IS A TREMENDOUS -- AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE. KIDS LOSE SO MUCH OVER THE SUMMER. KEEP THEM ENGAGE IN STIMULATED, A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE NOT SO LUCKY. WHAT YOU HAVE ON THAT MEASURE? HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU FOR TEACHING AND CARING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR STUDENTS YEAR ROUND, NOT JUST WHEN YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO STRESS ABOUT IMPROVING EDUCATION IN OUR COUNTRY IS WE SHALL LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT WORKS. A LOT OF OF PEOPLE HAVE A BIG ARGUMENTS OVER THE RIGHT THINGS TO DO BUT THEY OFTEN DO NOT REFERENCE THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT WORKS. YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON WHAT SEEMED THAT WORKS. KIDS WHO DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS MANY OF US TRY TO PROVIDE FOR OWN CHILDREN OVER THE SUMMER ACTUALLY LOSE GROUND. YOU CAN WORK REALLY HARD ALL YEAR AS A STUDENT, AS A FAMILY TO SUPPORT THE STUDENT, AND AS THE TEACHER. THEN YOU HAVE THREE MONTHS AND OTHER KIDS LIKE YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS ARE GOING TO MUSEUMS AND GOING ON INTERESTING TRIPS. MAYBE WATCHING MOVIES WITH OUR FAMILY THAT THEY TALK ABOUT. A LOT OF STIMULATION. WE KNOW A LONGER SCHOOL YEAR, SUMMER PROGRAMS, A LONGER SCHOOL DAY, ARE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN KIDS WHO DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AND KIDS WHO DO. HONESTLY, A GOOD SUMMER PROGRAM CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THE DISTRICT SHALL LOOK AT PARTICULARLY FOR KIDS WHO MAY NOT HAVE GOOD ALTERNATIVES. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT. THAT IS GREAT. IS A YOUNG WOMAN BACK OF THEIR. YES, YOU. -- THE YOUNG WOMAN BACK THERE. >> I JUST GOT BACK FROM DOING A YEAR OF SERVICE FROM TEHHE CORPS IN LOS ANGELES. ONE THING I'VE NOTICED THAT REALLY BOTHERED ME WAS THAT THERE WAS NO SCHOOL NURSE AND VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STUDENTS. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED WERE PROVIDED BY PHILANTHROPIST AND NOT THE GOVERNMENT OR OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY. I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO IN REGARDS TO GAIN REDUCTION -- GANG REDUCTION. HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF AMERICORPS AND DOING YOUR SERVICE. WE HAVE 75,000, MOSTLY YOUNG PEOPLE IN AMERICORPS EVERY YEAR. I WANT TO GET IT UP TO 250,000. I REALLY BELIEVE IN SERVICE. I BELIEVE IN SERVICE IN EITHER NATIONAL SERVICE, MILITARY SERVICE, SOME SERVICE A YOUNG PERSON CAN DO TO GET BACK TO OUR COUNTRY AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. AGAIN, WE ARE NOT ALWAYS BEING SMART ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A BETTER INVESTMENT THAT WILL SAVE US MONEY. KIDS WHO ARE IN SCHOOL WHO HAVE SOME SORT OF MEDICAL OR HEALTH ISSUE. IF IT IS NOT TAKING CARE OF, IT CAN INTERFERE WITH THEIR LEARNING. I'VE SEEN IT OVER MANY YEARS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND . KIDS WHO DO NOT KNOW THEY CANNOT HEAR DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE NOT SEEING WELL HAVE ABSENTEES THAT -- JUST PROBLEMS. MOST OF US HAVE NOT THANKFULLY HAD TO EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE A LOT OF KIDS WHO SHOW UP IN SCHOOL WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE STEADILY CUT BACK ON A NURSE OR SOME KIND OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. YOU ARE SO RIGHT. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO PHILANDERER PIECE THAT DOES PHILANTHROPIST -- PHILANTHROPISTS THAT PAY TO SEND NURSES TO 10 SCHOOLS BUT WE HAVE 10,000 SCHOOLS. HOW DO WE PAY FOR SERVICES TO MAKE SURE KIDS ARE HEALTHY AND DO AS WELL AS THEY CAN? THE ONLY WAY IS TO HAVE A MUCH MORE SUPPORTIVE PROGRAM FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM THE LOCAL STATE- FEDERAL LEVEL. I KNOW IT SAVES MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. PEOPLE SAY WELL TO PUT OUR NURSE IN EVERY SCHOOL. YOU GOVERNORS COVERING TWO OR THREE SCHOOLS. YOU CAN DO THAT. THE POINT IS WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE? SICK KIDS WHO DO NOT DO WELL AND WILL OFTEN DROP OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DOING ALL AND WILL NEVER LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL IN MY BOOK, BURDEN. A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE REST OF US. -- AND BECOME A BURDEN. WE HAVE TO GET SMART ON HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY TO GET THE BEST RESULTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND RAISING THAT ISSUE. I HEAR ABOUT IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE CONTINUITY. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT AND MORE CHILDREN ARE AVAILABLE FOR TREATMENT -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: WE AT LEAST HAVE A FUNDING STREAM TO TAKE CARE OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. OFTEN TIMES THE ISSUE IS HOW TO GET THEM IDENTIFIED? WHO WILL BE ON THE FRONTLINE? A CHILD SPENT NEVER EIGHT HOURS AND THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO REFER THEM AND TREAT THE WAS THAT CAN BE TREATED AND THE SCHOOL SITE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. OH, MY GOODNESS FOR YOU WE GO. HOW ABOUT YOU? >> MY NAME IS MEGAN AND I AM FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. I AM A LIFE COACH AT A NONPROFIT IN BOSTON. AND I WORK SPECIFIC WITH A BOY IS A YOUNG MAN AGAIN WHO ARE VICTIM OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. THAT IS USUALLY THE RESPONSE I GET. WHEN I GET TO THESE KIDS BACK INTO SCHOOL, THERE IS A MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF FAMILIES PARTNERS WITH BRIDGEWATER STATE TO OFFER THEM COLLEGE WHICH I THINK IS AMAZING. THESE KIDS GO THROUGH SO MUCH. I THINK YOUR PLAN IS REALLY GREAT AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD IMPLEMENT ANYTHING TO SUPPORT WHAT DCF DOES? HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT WORK. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, FOR DEALING WITH A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE, THE EXPLOITED, THE MARGINIZED, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SOME GROUPS OF KIDS NEED MORE INTENSIVE HELP. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE TO DEAL WITH THESE VULNERABLE GROUPS OF KIDS AND I WOULD JUST MAYBE LIST A COUPLE OF THEM. KIDS IN JUVENILE FACILITIES. A LOT OF KIDS, THEY MAKE A MISTAKE AND THEN THEY ARE PUT INTO A FACILITY WHERE OFTEN THEY GET WORSE, NOT BETTER. THEY DON'T GET ADEQUATE EDUCATION. THEY OFTEN DON'T EVEN GET ADEQUATE NUTRITION, EXERCISE, ANYTHING ELSE. THEN WE TURN THEM OUT AND WE WAIT FOR THEM TO DO SOMETHING WORSE BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU KNOW? THEY HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DO ANY BETTER AND THEY DON'T SEE MUCH OF A FUTURE. THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW, IN SO MANY PLACES, YOU'RE IN FOSTER CARE UNTIL YOU GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR TURN 18, WHICHEVER IS FIRST. I HAVE WORKED ON FOSTER CARE ISSUES FOR A REALLY LONG TIME GOING BACK TO MY CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND DAYS. I HAVE DEFENDED FOSTER CARE KIDS AND ADVOCATED FOR LEGAL CHANGES AS FIRST LADY AND WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET CHANGES IN FOSTER CARE. IT REALLY BREAKS MY HEART. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN FOSTER KIDS. I'VE KNOWN MANYOR THEM. SO MANY OF THEM JUST NEED SOME SUPPORT AND PERMANENCE AND PREDICTABILITY. ALONG COMES THE AGE OF 18 AND IN SOME CASES OF OUR COUNTRY, THE SOCIAL WORKER SHOWS UP WITH EVERYTHING THEY OWN IN A BLACK GARBAGE BAG AND SAYS YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. IF THEY TURNED 18 AND THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY ARE LUCKY ENOUGH, THE FOSTER FAMILY SAYS STAY HERE UNTIL YOU GRADUATE. SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT. AND THEY ARE LITERALLY SENT OUT THE DOOR. I HAD TO HELP AND INTERVENE AS A SENATOR AND WITH OTHER PEOPLE TO HELP KIDS WHO ARE SLEEPING IN THIS BUS STATIONS WHO WANT TO FINISH SCHOOL AND NOWHERE TO GO. I HAVE TALKED TO FOSTER KIDS WHO I HAVE TALKED TO FOSTER KIDS WHO HAVE NOWHERE TO GO AND THE DORM IS CLOSED. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM? I MENTION THIS BECAUSE WE COULD NEVER FORGET BECAUSE AS CHALLENGING AS IT IS FOR MANY PEOPLE NOW, ECONOMICALLY AND IT IS, THERE ARE GROUP S OF PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE REALLY IN TROUBLE. SO I WANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO DO MORE, TO HELP THEM AND I WILL LOOK FOR WAYS TO DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] MY GOODNESS. OH! OK. I WAS GOING TO GO THIS WAY AND THEN COME BACK. IS THAT OK? I'LL BE BACK. I PROMISE. I'LL BE BACK. OK. THE GENTLEMAN IN UNIFORM BACK THERE. [APPLAUSE] >> GOOD AFTERNOON, HILLARY. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I SERVED 22 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY. I LIVE RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS NOT ABOUT EDUCATION BUT ABOUT THE PROBLEMS GOING ON WITH THE V.A. RECENTLY THERE WAS THIS DENTIST THAT KILLED A LION AND THERE WAS THIS OUTRAGE THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. YOU HAVE OVER 8,000 VETERANS A YEAR COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET ACCESS TO THE V.A. BECAUSE OF THE CORRUPTION GOING ON AT THE V.A. TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT FOR YOU. THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A WORLD WAR II DEATH MARCH EVERY YEAR. THAT IS JUST THE SUICIDE VICTIMS. WHISTLEBLOWERS, 47,000 VETERANS A YEAR. IF YOU HAVE 47,000 -- WITH EVERY ONOR THEM BEING WIPED OFF THE MAP EVERY YEAR, WHAT WOULD THAT BE CALLED? WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE? WHAT WEPTS AS VETERANS AND I'M A LEADER IN THIS ASPECT. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY? WE STARTED A FACEBOOK PAGE CALLED V. SAMBINGS LYING. THERE IS OVER 8,500 OF US THERE. WE'RE WORKING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE V.A. THE UNDERSECRETARY KNOWS MY NAME ON THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE. THEY KNOW WHO I AM. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO GET THIS CORRUPTION STRAIGHTENED OUT. THIS IS OUR V.A. WE ARE GOING TO CLEAN IT UP. OK? BUT WE NEED HELP. AND WHAT WE NEED IS TO SEE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE CORRUPT IN THE V.A., WHO ARE HURTING US. [NO AUDIO] INDICTED. THIS HAS GOT ON THE THE POINT WHERE IT IS RIDICULOUS AND WE NEED HELP. WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN. BECAUSE WARRIORS NEVER GIVE UP. EVER. WE ADAPT AND OVERCOME. WE WILL CLEAN UP OUR V.A. BUT WE NEED OUR HELP. HILLARY CLINTON: YOU WILL HAVE IT. YOU WILL HAVE IT. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW -- [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR NOT ONLY EXPLAINING WHAT IS HAPPENING, BUT FOR BEING COMMITTED TOING US. AND TO CLEAN UP THE V.A. SO THAT IT OPERATES AS IT SHOULD FOR YOU AND FOR EVERY VETERAN INCLUDING YOUR SON, WHEN HE EVENTUALLY IS NO LONGER ACTIVE DUTY. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A PATRIOT. THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I WILL BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT -- [APPLAUSE] THERE IS NO EXCUSE. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE. NO EXCUSE FOR NEGLIGENCE. NO EXCUSE FOR ANY KIND OF MISTAKE OR OVERSIGHT THAT IN ANY WAY HARMS ONE OF OUR VETERANS. SO WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. [NO AUDIO] HILLARY CLINTON: LET ME HAVE SOMEONE TALK WITH YOU AFTER THIS. TO GET MORE INFORMATION. I CAN'T COMMENT -- THE LAWS MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED. I CAN'T COMMENT ON LEGAL MATTERS WITHOUT KNOWING. YOU GIVE US INFORMATION. YOU GOT IT. YOU ARE WELL PREPARED. I CAN TELL . YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY. THANK YOU. WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL FOLLOW UP AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD INFORMATION WITH -- FROM YOU AND TO DISCUSS WITH YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: YOU KNOW -- I JUST KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING I SAW IN YOU WHEN YOU STOOD UP. WE'LL GET IT DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY GOODNESS. WOW. THAT WAS GREAT. THANK YOU. YES, MA'AM, RIGHT HERE. >> I HEAR A CHALLENGE AND I THINK THAT IS WONDERFUL. MY QUESTION IS FOR UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, GO TO -- ACCEPTED AT COLLEGE BUT THEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANY -- THEY ARE NOT -- DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? HILLARY CLINTON: YES, THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE GOT AROUND THE COUNTRY. SOME STATES ARE BEGINNING TO DEAL WITH IT. THEY ARE BEGINNING TO OFFER INSTATE TUITION TO UNDOCUMENTED HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WHO WANT TO GO ON TO COLLEGE. SOME STATES ARE ALSO WORKING TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF THAT. I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE I WANT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WHICH WILL GIVE US A VERY -- [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO MAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ARGUMENT. IT GOES BACK TO MY POINT ABOUT CHINA. ONE OF OUR ADVANTAGES, AND PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS RECK FIES THIS, IS THAT IMMIGRANTS START MORE BUSINESSES. BY A VERY BIG PROPORTION. I WANT MORE AMERICANS TO START MORE BUSINESSES BUT IMMIGRANTS START MORE BUSINESSES NOW. WE HAVE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS, BOTH LEGAL AND UNDOCUMENTED. THAT IS ONE OF OUR ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IT IS ALSO AN ADVANTAGE FOR OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KEEP REPLENISHING OUR REVENUES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE SO THE MORE PEOPLE WE GET LEGALLY INTO THE WORKPLACE, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR OUR ECONOMY, FOR OUR PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND IT WILL GIVE US AN ADVANTAGE IN COMPETING AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY NOW STARTING TO AGE FASTER. I THINK WE HAVE GOT SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES HERE. SO THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT. YES, THIS YOUNG WOMAN RIGHT THERE. YES. HERE IT COMES. >> HI. THIS SUMMER WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN CHARLESTON, CHATTANOOGA AND LAFAYETTE. WE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN OUR SCHOOLS, OUR CHURCHES, OUR MOVIE THEATERS AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT MOST AMERICANS FEEL THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR GUN LAWS, OUR LEADERS HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY STEPS TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO HELP US FEEL SAFER AND ADDRESS THE GUN VIOLENCE THAT IS KILLING 88 AMERICANS A DAY. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU. HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, I WILL BE FIGHTING WITH YOU RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO TRY TO PREVENT THESE TERRIBLE KILLINGS AND YOU JUST MENTIONED A FEW OF THEM, AS YOU SAY 88 PEOPLE KILLED BY GUNS EVERY DAY IN AMERICA. NOW FROM EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN, A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS AND A MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS TO OVERCOME A VERY ENTRENCHED SPECIAL INTEREST THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT, AS I SAY THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS OR THE MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS TO GET, NUMBER ONE, A BACKGROUND CHECK THAT ACTUALLY WORKED AND WE HAVE TOO MANY GLITCHES IN IT RIGHT NOW THAT'S HOW THE YOUNG MAN WHO MASSACRED THE NINE PEOPLE IN CHARLESTON AT THEIR BIBLE STUDY, HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN A GUN. THEY DIDN'T GET ALL THE INFORMATION IN AND THERE IS A THREE-DAY LIMIT AND HE GOT THE AND WE KNOW HOW HE USED IT. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW. I JUST DON'T THINK THERE IS THE KIND OF CONTRADICTION THAT SOME ON THE OTHER SIDE TRY TO ARGUE ON BEHALF OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT WITH SENSIBLE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION MEASURES AND PROTECTING PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO BEAR ARMS. I WILL TAKE THAT ON. I KNOW THAT IT IS POLITICALLY CHALLENGING. [APPLAUSE] BUT AT SOME POINT, THIS -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO REGAIN OUR SENSES. OUR COUNTRY LASTED FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND IN FACT, IT WAS ONLY RELATIVELY RECENTLY THAT YOU KNOW, THE SUPREME COURT DECISION BEGAN TO REINTERPRET THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WHAT ABOUT THE REST? WHAT ABOUT THE YOUNG MOM WITH HER TWO KIDS WHO WAS IN A SUPERMARKET AND SOME GUY GETS TO COME IN WITH AN AK-47 OVER HIS BACK BECAUSE HE GOT A NEW PERMIT THAT PERMITS HIM TO WALK AROUND AND THREATEN AND INTIMIDATE AND SCARE THE HECK OUT OF THAT YOUNG MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN! I DON'T GET IT! [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IT IS GOOD WORK. IT IS IMPORTANT WORK. OH, MY GOODNESS. THERE ARE JUST SO MANY HANDS. OK. YES, SIR. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW TO GET THE OVERPAID AND TOO NUMEROUS ADMINISTRATORS AT UNIVERSITIES OUT OF THE WAY SO THE FACULTY CAN DO THEIR WORK? [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, CAN I SAY THAT I HOPE WITH MY COMPACT, THE IDEA BEHIND THE COMPACT IS THAT WE WILL PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR STATES TO DO MORE TO BE ABLE TO CUT THE COST SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN AFFORD A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, AND AMONG THE LISTSOR THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE DONE IS DE-EMPHASIZING LAYERS UPON LAYERS OF ADMINISTRATION AND REEMPHASIZING TEACHING. AND PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE -- I -- I HAVE BEEN MEETING A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE. T.H.D. IN AREAS OF SCARCITY, WHO'LL NOT -- THEY ARE NOT BEING HIRED. THEY ARE NOT BEING PUT ON A TENURE TRACK BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY SAYS WELL, WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPACE FOR YOU. AND THEY ARE MAKING $22,000, $24,000 A YEAR. BARELY ENOUGH. WELL, THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T PAY OFF THEIR DEBTS AND THEY ARE HAVING A VERY HARD TIME SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES. SO I JUST THINK SOMEHOW OUR VALUES AND PRIORITIES GOT OUT OF WHACK. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANY PARTICULAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, BUT I HAVE HEARD ENOUGH STORIES TO BELIEVE THAT WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB STREAMLINING THE TOP, SAVING MONEY AND PUTTING MONEY INTO FACULTY, PARTICULARLY YOUNG FACULTY BECAUSE IT IS THE YOUNG FACULTY THAT ARE BEING MOST DISADVANTAGED BY EITHER NOT BEING HIRED OR NOT BEING PAID ADEQUATELY SO THAT THEY CAN'T REALLY DO THE JOB THAT THEY HAVE DREELED OF DOING. I'M WITH YOU ON THAT. WE HAVE TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: OK. ANY MAN WITH THREE STICKERS INCLUDING ONE ON HIS FOREHEAD! >> HELLO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING A CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN HERE AT HOME AND ALSO GLOBALLY AS WELL. I BELIEVE AS REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE BORN, YOU SHOULD HAVE -- EVERY CHILD SHOULD GROW UP TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THEIR POTENTIAL. WHEN WE CREATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WILL -- THESE KIDS, THEN WE CAN BUILD INDEPENDENT PEOPLE. IF ELECTED, WILL YOU BRING THESE COUNTRIES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR TOGETHER TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN? HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A STAKE IN TRYING TO IMPROVE EDUCATION AROUND THE WORLD TO TRY TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE, PEOPLE'S ECONOMIC FORTUNES TO IMPROVE. TO CREATE MIDDLE CLASSES AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH IS TIED TO EDUCATION. THAT IS GOOD FOR US. THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY. THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO WHAT WE CAN AND IT WILL HAVE TO BE A PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE IT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS, THE PRIVATE SECTOR, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, CHARITIES, FAITH-BASED GROUPS AND A LOT OF OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PARTNERS. I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY THAT YOUR QUESTION KIND OF PROMPTED IN ME. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN -- WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, I WENT TO 112 COUNTRIES FOR YOU. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF PLACES THAT -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: YOU KNOW, THAT WERE STILL DEVELOPING, THAT WERE VERY POOR. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WORKED HARD TO CREATE AN OPENING TO BURMA NOW CALLED MYANMAR IS BECAUSE IT IS VERY STRATEGICICALLY LOCATED BUT ALSO HAD BEEN SO ISOLATED FOR SO LONG. IT WAS APPARENT UNDER MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, THE VERY TOP HAD DONE VERY WELL. THERE WAS NO MIDDLE CLASS. AND THEN THERE WAS JUST DIFFERENT DEGREES OF POVERTY. AND WHEN YOU SEE THAT, AND YOU REALIZE HOW VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE TO DISEASE AND TO OTHER, YOU KNOW, BOTH HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW, IT REALLY DOES GIVE YOU A GREAT PERSPECTIVE ON HOW BLESSED AND FORTUNATE WE ARE AND WE HAVE TO KEEP INVESTING IN THE OUR OWN PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO KEEP DOING BETTER BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR AND WE HAVE TO OFFER IT TO OUR NEXT GENERATION. AND I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, I DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN AMERICA. AND EVEN THOSE WHO WOULD PUBLICLY CRITICIZE US WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN HOW WE WERE SOLVING PROBLEMS AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT AND HE ASKED ME TO BECOME SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE MIDST OF THE TERRIBLE ECONOMIC CRISIS, THERE WAS A LOVET ANXIETY ABOUT THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY BECAUSE IT STILL IS THE BASIC DRIVER OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD. AND I COULD JUST SEE PEOPLE SAYING IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE UNITED STATES TO GET IT RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO KEEP HOLDING UP THE BANNER OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU, WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE LOST. I THINK THAT IS TRUE. I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO SAY UpTHOSE FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ARE BEHIND US, I THINK THEY ARE WRONG. IT IS NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S LEADERSHIP. IT IS NOBODY'S LEADERSHIP. THAT WOULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE THE VALUES, THE INTEREST, THE ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE BASICALLY LED FOR THE LAST CENTURY AND NEED TO DO AGAIN. SO YOUR QUESTION, WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT KIDS LIVING FAR AWAY IS CONNECTED TO HOW WELL WE TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS RIGHT HERE TODAY, BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY BE AS STRONG AS OUR ECONOMY IS, OUR PEOPLE'S DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS ARE AND THAT'S WHY IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WHAT I'M TRYING TO ARGUE FOR IS TO BUILD ON WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT AND MAKE IT EVEN GREATER SO THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, NOT BEHIND US. BUT THAT CAUSES US TO HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. I THINK WE'RE UP TO IT. I WOULD BPT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IF I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE UP TO IT. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THANKS FOR THE HAIR COMPLIMENT BEFORE. I DIDN'T STOP AND THANK YOU. I DIDN'T THINK YOU FOR THE HAIR COMPLIMENT. YOU KNOW, SINCE WHO KNOWS WHAT MY HAIR WILL LOOK LIKE FROM DAY-TO-DAY. ANY DAY THAT IT IS GOOD, I APPRECIATE YOU NOTICING IT, THANK YOU. >> HILLARY, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE MY T-SHIRT, AND I HAVE A BIT OF GOOD NEWS FOR YOU, WHICH IS THAT MY DAUGHTER SURVIVED STAGE 4 KIDNEY CANCER. [APPLAUSE] SHE IS 4 YEARS OLD AND YOU TOOK TIME OUT AT YOUR 2014 REUNION TO SPEAK TO US, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. SO THANK YOU. HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> SHE IS DOING FINE. THE THING IS SHE IS BLACK AND UNARMED BLACK PEOPLE KEEP GETTING SHOT. AND BLACK LIVES MATTER AND -- [APPLAUSE] >> YOU KNOW, SHE SURVIVED STAGE 4 KIDNEY CANCER. I NEED HER TO GRADUATE INTO A WORLD THAT IS MORE JUST AND FAIR. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: OH, BLESS YOU! [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I'M THRILLED TO HEAR HOW SHE IS DOING AND PLEASE GIVE HER A BIG HUG. GIVE HER ANOTHER BIG HUG FROM ME, PLEASE. THE LAST MONTH, MANY MONTHS NOW, WE JUST HAD THE ANNIVERSARY AT FERGUSON AND ANOTHER INCIDENT OCCURRED, SOMEONE ELSE BEING SHOT. WE DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT THE FACTS ARE ACROSS THE BOARD CONCERNING WE HAVE DEEP UNADDRESSED SYSTEMIC RACE AND JUSTICE ISSUES AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT WE HONESTLY TALK ABOUT THEM AND TRY TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AROUND DEALING WITH THIS. IT IS NOT ENOUGH JUST TO, YOU KNOW, SAY WE'RE CONCERNED. WE HAVE TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND SAY WE'RE SO CONCERNED. HERE IS WHAT WE ARE WILLING TO DO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNINGOR MY CAMPAIGN. ONE IS WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT MASS INCARCERATION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: IT HAS UNFORTUNATELY BEEN ONE OF THE ROOT REASONS WHY SO MANY FAMILIES, PARTICULARLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE TORN APART, UNDERMINED, NEVER FORMED AND THERE IS NO DOUBT -- THERE IS JUST NO DOUBT. NOBODY WANTS TO RETURN TO LACK OF SAFETY OR RISING CRIME. SO LET'S JUST POCKET THAT. NOBODY WANTS THAT. BUT THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT IF YOU'RE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN OF WHATEVER AGE, TEENAGER AND UP, YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED, TO BE CONVICTED, TO BE IMPRISONED FOR DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS A WHITE MAN WHO'LL NOT BE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND THAT IS NOT -- YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYBODY WROTE DOWN IN A LAW. THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT HAS GROWN UP OVER TIME WHERE PEOPLE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. AND WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, WORKING WITH THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT THE SYSTEM AND INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS RESPECT THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE RESPECT THEM. AND THERE IS A LOT OF WORK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. SOME OF THE WHAT I PROPOSED, BODY CAMERAS, THAT IS A WAY OF AT LEAST HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE, BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRAINING, MORE AWARENESS OF PEOPLE'S OWN INDIVIDUAL FEELINGS OR MAYBE BIASES. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I THINK THAT THESE TERRIBLE INCIDENTSES OF A THE PAST YEAR, THEY GO WAY BACK, BUT CERTAINLY IN THE HEADLINES OF THE PAST YEAR REALLY CALL ON EVERYBODY IN EVERY COMMUNITY JUST TO SAY HEY, WE NEED TO DO A VERY CLEAR ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHERE WE STAND. NOW LET'S RID OURSELVES OF BIAS AND PREDGES AND DISCRIMINATION AND MAKE SURE OUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE WELL PREPARED FOR THE DIFFICULT JOBS WE ASK THEM TO DO. LET'S TRY TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT WORK IF WE DON'T ADMIT WE HAVE A PROBLEM. AND I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT AND YES, OF COURSE BLACK LIVES MATTER. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. I HAVE GOT TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION. ANYBODY ON COLLEGE? I'LL TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE SINCE PEOPLE CAME TO TALK ABOUT COLLEGE, I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET A COLLEGE QUESTION. OK. WHY DON'T YOU ASK? >> HI, HILLARY. I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GOING FORWARD WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE BETTER. WE'RE A FAMILY OF FOUR KIDS. MY DAD WORKED ALL OF HIS LIFE. WE ALL HAD TO TAKE OUT PRIVATE LOANS. ME, MY SISTER AND SOON MY YOUNGER BROTHER WILL BE LIVING AT HOME PAYING OFF HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEBT. WHEN I GRADUATED I HAD ABOUT $120,000 IN DEBTS. THE AVERAGE IS $30,000, I REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE GETTING THAT NUMBER FROM. BECAUSE -- AND IN GRADUATE SCHOOL. WITH GRADUATE I'M AT $250,000. YEAH. AND I HAVE LOANS THAT WHEN I APPLIED FOR THEM SAID I WOULD BE AT 8%. NOT THE 12%. HILLARY CLINTON: FIRST OF ALL, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT THAT HAPPENED TO YOU. THAT IS JUST WRONG. I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS BUT I WILL SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTINUE DICTION, THAT IS WRONG. -- CONTRADICTION, THAT IS WRONG. WITH THE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST THAT THEY KICKED UP ON YOU. WELL, YOU GOING TO BE HELPED BY MY PLAN. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO -- [APPLAUSE] TO REFINANCE ALL OF YOUR DEBT TO BRING IT DOWN TO WHERE THE INTEREST RATE IS RIGHT NOW. WHO DID YOU BORROW FROM? WERE THOSE GOVERNMENT LOANS OR PRIVATE LOANS? SO YOU HAVE GOVERNMENT LOANS PLUS THREE PRIVATE ONES. WELL, AUFL O THEM CAN BE REFINANCED. WE HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, WHEN WE DID THE NUMBERS ON THIS, THE WAY WE WILL PAY FOR IT IS BY CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES AND THE DEDUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE AT THE TOP AND WE WILL GO AND IN ONE INSTANCE, WE WILL GO BACK TO WHERE IT WAS WHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS IN OFFICE. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD LOVE AND EMBRACE. AND WE WILL TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE SAVE FROM CLOSING THOSE AND THEN WE WILL USE IT TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. TO REFINANCE LOANS. 40 MILLION PEOPLE. YOU'RE ONE OF THEM. WHO HAVE THOSE LOANS THAT DESPERATELY NEED REFINANCING. YOU'RE A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN. YOU OUGHT TO BE OUT IN THE WORLD MAKING YOUR WAY AND I HOPE YOU CAN BE. I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING IT IS FOR YOU TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF DEBTS AND BE BACK AT HOME AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR EDUCATION. SO WE WANT TO REFINANCE THE LOANS AND THEN WE WANT TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE ON THE FRONT END SO PEOPLE DON'T ENDS UP WHERE YOU ARE. I ALSO WANT TO PUT A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF LOANS, AT SOME POINT IT IS JUST COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. WE ARE GOING TO HELP. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327681-1/governor-scott-walker-rwi-remarks-health-care,Governor Scott Walker (R-WI) Remarks on Health Care,Scott Walker,"WELCOME. WE ARE A PROUD MINNESOTA MANUFACTURING FACILITY. WE ARE IN OUR 70TH YEAR OF BUSINESS. WE MAKE A LOT OF THE PARTS YOU SEE BEHIND ME. THE INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ARE THE LAWN CARE INDUSTRIES, AGRICULTURE. WE ARE HONORED TODAY TO HAVE SCOTT WALKER AND HIS CAMPAIGN TODAY TO UNVEIL HIS ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE. IT IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE AT THIS TIME TO INTRODUCE OUR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. HE WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE HOUSE IN 2010 AND ELECTED SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN 2014. HE'S A PRIVATE PILOT AND HE IS SINGLE, GIRLS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] >> QUITE AN INTRODUCTION. THANKS, STEVE, FOR HOSTING US HERE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A WONDERFUL FACILITY THAT YOU RUN. WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE YOU AS AN EMPLOYER. I'M VERY EXCITED TO HAVE GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER IN MINNESOTA. GOVERNOR WALKER IS A BOLD CONSERVATIVE REFORMER AND HE HAS BROUGHT UNBELIEVABLE POLICIES THAT HAVE TURNED AROUND THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. WHEN HE TOOK OVER IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, IT WAS A MESS. THEY HAD A $4 BILLION DEFICIT AND LOST JOBS AND HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ABOVE 8%. GOVERNOR WALKER LOWERED TAXES TO SPUR JOB GROWTH, BUT REFORMS IN PLACE THAT ELIMINATED WAGE FRAUD . AND REALLY TURNED THE STATE OF WISCONSIN AROUND. WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK HE HAS DONE. I'M VERY PROUD THAT HE HAS COME TO MINNESOTA TO ANNOUNCE HIS OBAMACARE REFORMS. THERE IS REALLY NO BETTER PLACE THAN MINNESOTA TO ANNOUNCE THESE REFORMS. WE HAVE SEEN THE WORST OF THE WORST OF OBAMA CARE IN MINNESOTA. 140,000 MINNESOTANS HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. PEOPLE HAVE LOST THE CHOICE THEY HAD. IN SOME CASES, THEY HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION FOR HEALTH COVERAGE. FRANKLY, ALL THE WHILE DURING THE WORST OF THE WORST, DEMOCRATS GAVE THE OBAMACARE EXECUTIVES IN MINNESOTA BONUSES TO REWARD THEM. WE NEED NEW, BOLD REFORM LIKE SCOTT WALKER HAS BROUGHT TO WISCONSIN HERE IN MINNESOTA AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IF YOU FOLLOWED THE NEWS YESTERDAY, YOU KNOW SCOTT WALKER IS READY FOR THE TASK AND IS ON INTIMIDATED. SCOTT WALKER IS THE BOLD REFORM LEADER WE NEED NOT ONLY IN MINNESOTA, BUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THANKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. CHRIS HAS DONE A SPECTACULAR JOB HERE IN MINNESOTA. I WAS PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU EARLIER IN THE CAPITAL. I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR OUR TEAM. WE ARE GOING TO COMPETE FOR THE CAUCUS AND WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE YOUR LEADERSHIP, GRASSROOTS WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE EMPLOYEES HERE. THANK YOU FOR HOSTING. I WAS KIDDING ON THE TOUR, I KNOW WHERE NOT TO STICK MY FINGER AND WHERE NOT TO TURN OFF THE LIGHT CURTAINS. YOU ARE LITERALLY FUELING THE ECONOMY HERE IN MINNESOTA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND THANKS TO EVERYBODY ELSE, ALL THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS FOR BEING HERE. AND HEARING A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR TODAY. WE WILL TALK ABOUT OBAMACARE. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AMERICA IS A CAN-DO KIND OF COUNTRY. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON THAT CAN'T GET THE JOB DONE. WASHINGTON IS 68 SQUARE MILES SURROUNDED BY REALITY. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WASHINGTON, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH WASHINGTON. I FEEL YOUR PAIN. I AM FED UP, TOO. WE WERE TOLD BY REPUBLICAN LEADERS DURING THE CAMPAIGNS LAST YEAR THAT WE JUST NEEDED A REPUBLICAN SENATE TO BE ELECTED TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. HERE WE SIT. BOTH CHAMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED SINCE JANUARY BY REPUBLICANS. THERE IS NOT A BILL ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, AMERICANS WANT MORE THAN JUST CAMPAIGN PROMISES. THEY WANT RESULTS. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. THAT IS SOMETHING I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND IT, I AM NOT INTIMIDATED. EVEN YESTERDAY AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR ON THE SOAPBOX, I WAS NOT INTIMIDATED BY THE PEOPLE THERE. LONG BEFORE WE TOOK ON UNION BOSSES IN MY STATE AND BEFORE WE TOOK ON LIBERAL SPECIAL INTEREST FROM WASHINGTON, WE TOOK ON SOME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN MY OWN PARTY. BACK IN 2010, WHEN I WAS THINKING OF RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS UPSET WITH THE DIRECTION MY STATE WAS HEADING. I THOUGHT IT WAS HEADING THE WRONG DIRECTION. A WEEK AFTER THE ELECTION, WE HAD ALL THE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS TOGETHER AND I SAID TO THEM THE VOTERS, THAT VOTERS HAD TOLD US THEY WANTED US TO BE BIG AND BOLD. THERE WERE SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WHO WERE UNEASY WITH THE IDEA OF TAKING ON THE STATUS QUO. THE SESSION WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. I SAID TO ALL OF THOSE LAWMAKERS INCLUDING SOME THAT WERE UNEASY, I SAID IT IS PUT UP OR SHUT UP TIME. THAT WAS THE HEADLINE. IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE. I HEARD WHAT VOTERS SAID. IF WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO, THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO THROW US OUT. I WAS PROUD NOT LONG AFTER TAKING OFFICE, THE VERY DAY I TOOK OFFICE, I TOOK THE OATH AND AUTHORIZED OUR STATE TO JOIN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. THEN WE SET OUT ON A PATH OF BOLD REFORMS. WE TOOK ON UNION BOSSES. THEN WE FIXED THE $3.6 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT. WE CUT TAXES BY $2 BILLION. WE DEFUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD. WE PUT A PHOTO ID REQUIREMENT TO VOTE IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. WE NOW ENSURE THAT EVERY ADULT IN OUR STATE WHO IS ABLE TO WORK MUST BE ABLE TO PASS A DRUG TEST BEFORE THEY GET A WELFARE CHECK. WE DID ALL THOSE THINGS. WE WENT BIG AND BOLD AND WE GOT RESULTS. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: WE TOOK ACTION. IN ADDITION TO THAT FIRST DAY, AUTHORIZING THE STATE TO JOIN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. NOT LONG AFTER THAT, I TURNED DOWN A STATE EXCHANGE UNDER OBAMACARE. AS YOU MENTIONED, MR. SPEAKER, HAVING LOOKED AT MINNESOTA AND MARYLAND, I AM GLAD LOOKING AT THE OTHER PROBLEMS STATES ARE HAVING THAT I MADE THAT DECISION SEVERAL YEARS AGO. UNLIKE MY FRIENDS RICK PERRY AND BOBBY JINDAL, I TURNED DOWN A MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER OBAMACARE. THAT WAS TOUGH IN A BLUE STATE LIKE WISCONSIN. THERE WERE SOME REPUBLICANS THAT WANTED US TO GRAB THE MONEY BUT WE TURNED IT DOWN BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO REPEAL. FAMILIES IN CHARGE OF THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. OTHER STATES WERE EXPANDING TO IT AND ADDING UNDERNEATH IT. WE SHOWED WE COULD GET RESULTS. I AM PROUD TO SAY THE STATE OF WISCONSIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY, EVERYONE LIVING IN POVERTY IS COVERED UNDER MEDICAID. WE TOOK EVERYONE ABOVE POVERTY AND TRANSITIONED IT TO THE MARKETPLACE. IT STILL PROTECTS TAXPAYERS. EVEN THE NONPARTISAN KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION LOOKED AT WHAT WE DID AND SAID WISCONSIN WAS THE ONLY STATE OUT OF ALL OF THE STATES THAT DID NOT TAKE THE MEDICAID EXPANSION, THE ONLY STATE THAT DID NOT HAVE A COVERAGE GAP. IN OTHER WORDS, WE GOT RESULTS WHILE STILL STAYING TRUE TO OUR COMMON SENSE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. IF INNOVATIVE REFORMS LIKE THAT CAN WORK IN A BLUE STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY CAN WORK FOR AMERICA. THERE IS NO DOUBT GOING FORWARD THEY CAN WORK FOR AMERICA. I AM WILLING TO STAND UP AGAINST ANYONE, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF MY OWN PARTY, TO GET THE JOB DONE. WE ARE NOT INTIMIDATED. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE TALK IS CHEAP IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS. IN OUR CASE, WE FOUGHT, WE WON, WE GOT RESULTS, WE DID ALL OF THAT IN A STATE THAT HASN'T GONE REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT SINCE 1984. WE WERE NOT INTIMIDATED, WE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. THE PEOPLE PAYING THE TAX BILLS GOING FORWARD. NOW WE HAVE A PLAN FOR AMERICA THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. IT IS SIMPLE. IT STARTS WITH A PREMISE THAT ON MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND LEGISLATION TO THE CONGRESS TO ONCE AND FOR ALL REPEAL OBAMACARE ENTIRELY. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: ALONG WITH THAT WE WILL REPLACE IT IN A WAY THAT PUTS PATIENTS AND FAMILIES, YOUR FAMILIES, BACK IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. WE CALL IT THE DAY ONE PATIENT FREEDOM PLAN. AS I MENTIONED, THE FIRST PART IS REPEALING OBAMACARE ENTIRELY. SOME ASK HOW YOU WILL DO THAT. YOU HAVE A CONGRESS OUT THERE, IT IS SIMPLE. WE MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENS. WE HAVE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE ENTIRELY, LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL. WE HAVE TO REPEAL EVERY PART OF IT, INCLUDING THE PARTS NANCY PELOSI DID NOT BOTHER TO READ. I TALKED TO REFORMERS LIKE PAUL RYAN AND TOM PRICE AND OTHERS OUT THERE. THEY ARE READY TO WORK WITH US TO PASS REFORMS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE NEED TO HAVE AN INCENTIVE OUT THERE TO DO THAT, THE GREAT WAY TO MOTIVATE THE CONGRESS TO PASS THE REFORMS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME OBAMACARE RULES THE REST OF AMERICA HAS BEEN PUT UNDER. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: ON MY FIRST DAY, I WILL ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WILL PULL BACK ON THE SPECIAL DEAL THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PROVIDED FOR CONGRESS. THEY PULLED OUT OF THIS LIKE THEY OFTEN EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM OTHER THINGS WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER LAWS. WE WILL DO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT REMOVES THE DEAL THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT IN PLACE AND MAKE THEM LIVE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS. ONCE THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE OBAMACARE PREMIUM INCREASES THAT MANY AMERICANS HAVE BEEN UNDER, I HAVE AN IDEA THAT WILL LIGHT A FIRE UNDER CONGRESS TO GET THINGS MOVING. A LOT OF CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT REPEALING OBAMACARE AND WE HAVE A PLAN TO MAKE SURE CONGRESS ACTS ON REFORMS RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME RULES THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THE NEXT PART IS ONCE WE GET ESTABLISHED THAT WE WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE, THE NEXT SCREEN I WILL SHOW YOU IS ABOUT ENSURING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY FOR EVERYONE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH INSURANCE. WE WANT AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE FOR EVERYONE. WE WILL HAVE LOWER PREMIUMS. ONCE YOU REPEAL OBAMACARE AND GET RID OF THOSE REGULATIONS, THAT IS PART OF THE PLAN, ONCE YOU ENCOURAGE MORE COMPETITION WHEN IT COMES TO INSURERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, YOU WILL SEE PREMIUMS GO DOWN FOR EVERYONE. INCLUDING FOR PEOPLE WHO GET IT FROM PLACES LIKE THIS. WE WILL SEE A REDUCTION OF PREMIUMS, WHICH IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SECOND, FOR THOSE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT GET IT FROM THEIR EMPLOYER, WE WILL HAVE AN OPTION THERE AS WELL. WE PROVIDE A TAX THAT IT THAT IS NOT TIED INTO AGE SO IT APPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD SO AS PEOPLE -- WE HAVE A GREAT TAX CREDIT UP THERE THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE NO MATTER WHETHER IT IS SOMEONE WHO IS WORKING PART-TIME AND GOING TO SCHOOL OR MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE WHO DECIDED THEY WANTED TO START A NEW BUSINESS. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. THIS GIVES THEM AN AFFORDABLE WAY TO GET AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. WE APPLY FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE. YOU ALL KNOW THIS -- WE PROVIDE, IN ADDITION, $1000 IN A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT TO PUT INTO HSAS. ON THE HEALTH SAVING ACCOUNTS. WE LIFT THE LIMITS. WE ARE RAISING THE LIMITS IN TERMS OF CONTRIBUTION LIMITS FOR BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO PASS IT ON TO YOUR CHILDREN AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. WE WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MORE OF YOUR OWN MONEY. YOU WILL DO MORE TO MANAGE YOUR HEALTH CARE AND YOUR HEALTH. IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE DOLLARS. IT IS PUTTING FREEDOM BACK IN THE HANDS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILIES TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH CARE AND MONEY. YOU ARE ALSO SEEING BESIDES THE CREDITS AND INCENTIVES, WE WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE ANYWHERE, IN ANY STATE. IN THE PAST, YOU HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED OVER STATE LINES. WHEREVER YOU THINK IS THE BEST SPOT, YOU CAN BUY IT OUTSIDE OF YOUR EMPLOYER, WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO BUY IT ANYWHERE IN ANY STATE. WE WILL MAKE SURE, THIS IS IMPORTANT, WHILE WE ARE REPEALING OBAMACARE, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE HEARD, WE WILL MAKE SURE PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, YOU WILL NOT GET BUMPED OFF YOUR COVERAGE. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO FACE HUGE INCREASES JUST BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OR BECAUSE YOU GET SICK. THAT IS THE FIRST PHASE. ENSURE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE OPTIONS FOR EVERYONE. THE NEXT THING IS MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE BY EMPOWERING THE STATES. ONE PART OF THAT IS THE ABILITY TO OVERSEE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE BACK TO THE STATE. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THAT'S ONE OF THOSE WHERE THE SPEAKER AND I KNOW THIS BUT I KNOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN YOU SEND POWER OUT OF WASHINGTON TO THE STATE LEVEL. THAT IS WHAT WE DO WITH THIS PLAN. IN TERMS OF OVERSEEING HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATES, HAVE IT DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL. ON TOP OF THAT, WE WANT TO REFORM MEDICAID. THAT MEANS FIXING IT AND SENDING IT BACK TO THE STATES. I HAVE SEEN FOR YEARS WE HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS I AM PROUD OF IS EVEN UNDER OBAMACARE, WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE EVERY PERSON LIVING IN POVERTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY STATE'S HISTORY WAS COVERED. WE DID IT WITHOUT TAKING THE SO-CALLED FREE FEDERAL MONEY. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE FEDERAL MONEY. WE'RE THE ONES THAT PAY FOR IT OUT THERE. WE NEED TO PUT THOSE ABILITIES AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TRULY NEEDY PEOPLE GET THE CARE THEY NEED, YOU NEED TO SEND THE POWER BACK TO THE STATE WHERE IT CAN BE MORE INNOVATIVE AND MORE LIKELY TO GET THE JOB DONE. THEY ARE CARING FOR THE PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN MINNESOTA, WISCONSIN, IOWA. PART OF THIS IS JUST TAKING POWER FROM WASHINGTON AND SENDING IT BACK TO THE STATES. THE NEXT THING IS IMPROVING AND INCREASING THE QUALITY AND CHOICE THROUGH INNOVATION. WE ALLOW PEOPLE, CONSUMERS, TO GO OUT AND POOL TOGETHER AND PURCHASE HEALTH CARE. IT COULD BE A GROUP OF FARMERS OR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE WANT ANOTHER OPTION FROM THE CHOICES WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO POOL RESOURCES AND GO OUT THERE AND PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE TOGETHER. IT IS ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE MORE FREEDOM. WE ALSO PUT IN PLACE INCENTIVES FOR WELLNESS. THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT EMPLOYERS WORKING WITH EMPLOYEES ON WELLNESS PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE HEALTH. THAT IS BEYOND JUST TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE COST. IT IS IMPROVING HEALTH. YOU DEAL WITH CHRONIC DISEASES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE, THAT HELPS LOWER HEALTH CARE COST AS OPPOSED TO ALTERNATIVES. UNDER OBAMACARE, IT LEADS TO RATIONING. WE WANT PEOPLE TO LEAD HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER LIVES. THIS ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO PARTICIPATE IN WELLNESS PROGRAMS. WE ALSO PUT IN PLACE REFORMS FOR LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES. REFORM THE PROCESS FOR LONG-TERM CARE. THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF US IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT FINANCIAL STABILITY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS FOR YOUR FAMILY. WE PUT IN PLACE CHANGES SO YOU HAVE MORE STABILITY AND CONFIDENCE, NOT JUST FOR YOURSELF, BUT FOR THOSE IN YOUR FAMILY. WE ALLOW FOR MORE OPTIONS OUT THERE. SO THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE LONG-TERM CARE IN PEOPLE'S HOMES, NOT JUST HAVING TO GO TO CERTAIN PLACES. MORE ABILITIES TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM CARE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN. FINALLY, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR STATES TO PURSUE LAWSUIT REFORM AS IT APPLIES TO MEDICAL PROCEDURE. I WANT HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO GO FORWARD WITH PROCEDURES AND TESTS AND DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON MEDICALLY NECESSARY DECISIONS, NOT BASED ON TRYING TO AVOID THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. WE ARE GOING TO LET THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE MEDICAL NEEDS, NOT JUST IN TRYING TO AVOID FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BY PRACTICING DEFENSIVE MEDICINE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WILL HELP LOWER COSTS AND INCREASE CHOICES AND PUSH INNOVATION. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER BUT HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR IT AND HOW DOES IT APPLY TO OBAMACARE? FOR US, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR OURSELVES AND FAMILIES, BUT ALSO FOR TAXPAYERS. OUR PLAN IS FOR LONG-TERM CARE, GIVING PEOPLE MORE OPTIONS WHETHER YOU GET IT THROUGH EMPLOYERS. THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER-BASED HEALTH CARE TO INCREASE TAX CREDITS AND ALLOWING FAMILIES TO GET IT AT A REASONABLE RATE. WHETHER IT IS LOOKING AT PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO ACCOUNT. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ABOUT PUTTING MORE MONEY AND YOUR POCKET AND GIVING YOU MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR MONEY. THIS IS GOOD FOR FAMILIES AND PATIENTS AND YOUR FINANCIAL STABILITY. FOR ALL OF US, IT IS GOOD FOR TAXPAYERS. WE ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE UNDER OBAMACARE. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT BY REPEALING OBAMACARE ENTIRELY, WE ARE GETTING RID OF THE SPENDING AND TAXES. WHICH MEANS THIS ENDS UP BEING A TAX CUT TO ABOUT A TRILLION DOLLARS. WE GET RID OF THE TAXES AND SPENDING. THE TRILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN OBAMACARE. WE GIVE THAT BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE PROVIDE MORE RELIEF ON TOP OF THAT WITH THE HSA. WE PUT MORE MONEY BACK IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S HANDS. I THINK IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX RELIEF PLANS WE HAVE HAD WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TAX RELIEF PLANS IN THE PAST 40 SOME YEARS. THAT'LL HAVE A IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THE NATION'S ECONOMY. IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT OBAMACARE, YOU THINK ABOUT CANDIDATES TALKING ABOUT OBAMACARE AND WHAT THEY WILL DO TO REPEAL IT. WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW CANDIDATES THAT HAS LAID A PLAN OUT, NOT JUST FOR HOW TO REPEAL IT BUT WHAT TO DO IN ITS PLACE, BUT WE LAY OUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE NATION IS UNDERGOING A CRITICAL FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR DEBT AND DEFICIT PROBLEMS. NONE OF THESE PLANS WILL ADD TO THAT I. IN THIS CASE, OUR PLAN IS COST NEUTRAL. WE PAY FOR THIS AND THE CREDITS OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS. BY REFORMING THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE TAX TREATS SOME OF THE GOLDPLATED HEALTH CARE PLANS AND BY REFORMING AND FIXING MEDICAID BY SENDING IT BACK TO THE STATES WHERE IT IS MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO PEOPLE SERVED BY THESE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE AND WANT PATIENTS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. WE WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T BREAK THE BANK. THIS IS COST NEUTRAL. GOING FORWARD, WE FOUND AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT THAT DOESN'T ADD TO THE DEFICIT PROBLEMS, PROVIDES MASSIVE TAX RELIEF AND PUTS ALL OF YOU AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA IN CHARGE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. THIS IS THE LAYOUT. WE THINK IT IS A GREAT PLAN. IT IS A GREAT WAY TO REPEAL OBAMACARE AND NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT. FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, IT IS A GOOD PUNCHLINE IN YOUR SPEECHES. WE ACTUALLY NOW HAVE A PLAN TO GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT SHOWS EXACTLY HOW WE WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE. NOT JUST SAYING IT, BUT BY PUTTING IN PLACE EXECUTIVE ACTION THAT WILL FORCE CONGRESS TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME RULES EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO LIVE UNDER. WE THINK THAT IS THE LIGHT, THE FIRE UNDER CONGRESS TO MAKE THEM ACT IMMEDIATELY. THERE ARE GREAT REFORMERS THAT WANT TO. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT MIGHT NOT WANT TO. WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ANYONE ON TO GET THE JOB DONE. THAT IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT. THEY WANT YOU TO DELIVER ON THOSE PROMISES. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES US UNIQUE -- WE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT THINGS. WE FIGHT, WE WIN, WE GET RESULTS AND WE DO IT WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER, THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT. THINK ABOUT THE CONTRAST. WE KNOW WE HAVE A PLAN ON THE TABLE TO GET OBAMACARE REPEALED. A PLAN TO GET PATIENTS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE. TO GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON. THINK ABOUT THIS -- AS BAD AS THINGS HAVE BEEN UNDER OBAMACARE, THEY WOULD ONLY GET WORSE UNDER HILLARY CLINTON. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE HAD WITH OBAMACARE BUT THEY CAME LONG AFTER HILLARY CLINTON BUT THIS IDEA OUT. IN THE LATE 1990'S, THERE WAS HILLARY CARE. BACK IN THE EARLY 1990'S, THERE WAS HILLARY CARE. EVEN IN 2008 IN THE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY, HILLARY CLINTON LAID OUT A PLAN THAT INCLUDED THE FEDERAL MANDATE AND MANY PROVISIONS THAT ARE NOW IN OBAMACARE. WE WERE TOLD UNDER OBAMACARE THAT IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. THAT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE YEAR NATIONALLY. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DUMPED OFF THEIR HEALTH CARE INSURANCE BY THEIR EMPLOYER BY THE PRESSURES OF OBAMACARE. THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PREMIUMS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF. SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE HAVE LOST COVERAGE AND SEEN PREMIUMS GO UP. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE TOLD THIS IS NOT A TAX, BUT WE SEE THIS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS. THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC ABOUT OBAMACARE. THEY ONLY GET WORSE UNDER HILLARY CLINTON. SHE HAS A MUCH BIGGER GOLDEN WHAT WE SEE IN OBAMACARE. VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE NOVEMBER. I NENEXT NOVEMBER. I WANT TO BE THE CANDIDATE THAT SAYS HERE IS HOW WE WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE. IT IS NOT ABOUT MORE GOVERNMENT. IT IS ABOUT PUTTING FREEDOM INTO YOUR HANDS AND THE HANDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN THE HANDS OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY GOING FORWARD. THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. IT IS ALL ABOUT FREEDOM. IF YOU WANT A CANDIDATE WHO WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT OBAMACARE, WILL ACTUALLY GET CONGRESS TO REPEAL IT, GET CONGRESS TO PASS REFORMS, PUT REFORMS IN PLACE THAT PUTS YOU BACK IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS, THAT LETS YOU CONTROL YOUR MONEY AND FREEDOM GOING FORWARD, I'M YOUR CANDIDATE. FOUR YEARS AGO, LIKE WE SAW A LITTLE BIT IN IOWA, WE TOOK ON OVER 100,000 PROTESTERS. WE TOOK ON THE BIG GOVERNMENT UNION BOSSES. WE TOOK ON THE LIBERAL SPECIAL INTERESTS IN WASHINGTON WHO'S BEEN ALL SORTS OF MONEY AND RESOURCES TO TAKE US OUT. YES, WE EVEN TOOK ON SOMEONE IN OUR OWN PARTY EARLY ON TO SAY THE VOTERS IN MY STATE BACK IN 2010 SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE. THEY WERE WILLING TO MAKE A CHANGE BECAUSE THEY WANTED BIG, BOLD REFORMS AND THEY WANTED RESULTS AND THAT IS WHAT WE GAVE THEM. IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE AS PRESIDENT, WE WILL NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THINGS -- WE FIGHT, WE WIN, WE GET RESULTS AND WE DON'T COMPROMISE OUR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS RACE. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT AND LISTENING TO ME TODAY. AS I MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA WHO ARE JUST AS FRUSTRATED, JUST AS ANGRY WITH WASHINGTON AND EVEN SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS AS I AM. IF IT WAS JUST ABOUT ANGER, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CHECKED OUT. THEY WHAT HAVE BECOME CYNICAL. WHAT GIVES ME HOPE IS I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON AMERICA AND I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE EITHER. THAT IS WHY YOU ARE HERE INTERESTED. -- AND INTERESTED. YOU WANT PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO YOU, DO THE SORTS OF THINGS YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE IN WASHINGTON. I MAY NOT BE THE FLASHIEST. I MAY NOT HAVE THE PIZZAZZ. BUT I HOPE YOU SEE ACROSS AMERICA, I THINK LIKE YOU THINK. MY FAMILY LIVES LIKE YOUR FAMILY DOES. WE WANT THE SAME THINGS YOU DO AND WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN. WE HAVEN'T TESTED IN A WAY THAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE HAS BEEN TESTED. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, WE HAVE A PLAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN. WE WILL STAND UP FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND JUST. WE WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. WITH THAT, LET'S TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. [APPLAUSE] >> [INDISCERNIBLE] I WOULD SAY ONE THING -- DO YOU THINK UNDERWRITING NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET? I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT A MODEL. WE DID ALLOW PEOPLE WITH UNINSURABLE CONDITIONS TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE. THE MODEL NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. BUT WHEN YOU GIVE ALL PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERAGE WITH NO UNDERWRITING, THE WORST COVERAGE WITH BENEFITS BREAKS THE PLAN. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO RESEARCH THAT. I THINK MINNESOTA'S MODEL DID WELL. GOV. WALKER: THAT IS A GREAT POINT. WE HAVE A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN WISCONSIN. UNFORTUNATELY IN OBAMACARE, IT FORCES OUT OF THAT. THIS PLAN WOULD ALLOW THINGS LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN GOING FORWARD. TO GO BACK. WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS OF OURS WHO ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE GETTING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE WHO THEN UNDER OBAMACARE WERE MAKING TOO MUCH, NOT AL LOT, BUT TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR THE ASSISTANCE. UNDER OUR PLAN, BECAUSE IT IS NOT INCOME-BASED, IT IS BASED ON AGE, THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT AND WOULD USE IT FOR A PLAN JUST LIKE THAT. THAT IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF THINGS WE ENVISIONED WITH THIS PLAN. >> I LIKE YOUR IDEAS. THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE RELATED TO THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS -- YOU MENTIONED THE HIGH RISK POOL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT WOULD WORK? GOV. WALKER: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WE WOULD EMPOWER IT IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT. IT WOULD BE IN THE STATE LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL. STATES COULD SEE HEALTH INSURANCE IN GENERAL, BUT IT WOULD ALLOW STATES TO DO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THIS EMPOWERS THEM. IN OTHER STATES, WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. WE HAD TO CHANGE OUT OF THAT BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. THIS RESTORES THAT FREEDOM. >> ONE OF THE AREAS WE SEE AT OFFICIAL INCREASES IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL SIDE. WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT WE CAN DO TO CHANGE THE WAY -- IS THERE A HAPPY MEDIUM THAT COULD STILL ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND AT THE SAME TIME CUT BACK ON SOME OF THE CRAZY COSTS FOR NEW DRUGS. GOV. WALKER: I THINK WHEN YOU SEE THE MARKETPLACE NOW BEING MORE ACTIVE IN A COMPETITIVE CENTS, WHETHER SENSE, THAT WOULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ENCOURAGING LOWER-COST BECAUSE PEOPLE WHAT HAVE A GREATER HAND. THE MORE PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WATCH WHERE THEIR HEALTH HCARE DOLLARS ARE SPENT, THEY WILL HOLD THOSE ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE. MOST OF US PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR CELL PHONE PLANS THEN ARE HEALTH CARE PLANS. IT IS VERY ATTENTIVE TO PEOPLE MANAGING TO HOW THEY ARE DOING IT. I THINK THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR. A LITTLE TWEAK IN TERMS OF PUTTING INCENTIVES IN FOR STATES TO DO WILL ALS LAWSUIT REFORMS. IT WILL OFFSET FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE STATES TO PUT IN PLACE REASONABLE REFORMS BUT ALSO HELP WITH THE COSTS. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MINNESOTA. MY QUESTION IS MORE ON SALESMANSHIP OF YOUR PLAN. I LIVED IN ENGLAND, SO I KNOW WHAT IT DOES TO A COUNTRY WITH GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE. HOW DO YOU SELL YOUR PLAN SO YOU ARE NOT JUST A BIG BAD REPUBLICAN TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S INSURANCE UNDER OBAMACARE? GOV. WALKER: THE ONE THING THAT HAS INTEREST OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- I CAME OUT AGAINST THIS WHEN IRAN IN 2010. RAN IN 2010. AFTER I TOOK MY OATH, I TURNED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WISCONSIN TO GIVE THEM AUTHORIZATION TO JOIN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. I DID NOT DO THE MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER OBAMACARE. I WAS UP FRONT. EARLY ON, I THINK SOME PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. OVER TIME HERE AND SOME EXAMPLES WE GAVE, PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED. THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF OBAMACARE WAS NOT WHAT WAS PROMISED. IF IT HAD DONE EVERYTHING, I WOULD STILL HAVE CONCERNS, BUT IT WOULD BE A HARDER BATTLE. WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE TOLD THINGS LIKE IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND THAT ENDED UP BEING NOT JUST ME SAYING IT, BUT POLITIFAX SAYING IT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE YEAR -- WHEN PEOPLE ARE TOLD ALL THESE PROMISES. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A 19% INCREASE IN PREMIUM COSTS FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE, YOUNGER EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA JUST UNDER THE OBAMACARE STATE EXCHANGE. THE MORE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, LOOKED INTO THIS, THE MORE I THINK AMERICANS ARE SAYING OBAMACARE HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS EXPECTATIONS. THE KEY IS THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY YOU ARE AGAINST OBAMACARE. YOU HAVE TO SHOW WHAT YOU ARE FOR AND WHY IT IS BETTER. IT CARES FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT HELPS PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET INSURANCE FROM THEIR EMPLOYER. IT ALLOWS FOR FARMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS GROUPS TO POOL TOGETHER. IT PROVIDES FOR ALL THESE RATE OPTIONS, BUT IT DOES NOT DICTATED THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT. I THINK IN GENERAL, NOT JUST WHEN IT COMES WITH A HEALTH CARE PLAN BUT OVERALL, THE CONTRAST BETWEEN ME AND HILLARY CLINTON IS SIMPLE. HILLARY CLINTON IS IN A TOP-DOWN APPROACH OF GOVERNMENT. THAT IS WHAT WE GET OUT OF WASHINGTON. IT MAY BE WORST IN WHAT WE HAVE OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA. IN CONTRAST, I BELIEVE YOU GROW THE ECONOMY FROM THE GROUND UP. IT IS NEW AND FRESH AND ORGANIC. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T HURT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR, GO OUT AND START YOUR OWN CAREER, BUILD YOUR OWN LIFE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. THAT IS FREEDOM. I THINK MOST AMERICANS STILL FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IN THAT ESSENCE OF FREEDOM. THEY WANT A MORE FREE COUNTRY AND THEY WANT LEADERS TO RECOGNIZE THAT SENSE THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT PERSONAL FREEDOM. DO WE WANT TO HELP OUR NEIGHBOR THAT IS IN TROUBLE? ABSOLUTELY. THIS DOES. THIS SAYS IF YOU ARE DOWN AND OUT, WE STILL PROVIDE HELP FOR THOSE THAT ARE NEEDY. WE EMPOWER THE STATES THAT ARE MUCH BETTER AT DOING IT. WE SAY TO FOLKS WHO MAY BE IN POSITION WE JUST STARTED A COMPANY, LEFT THE COMPANY AND STARTED ON THE WRONG, TOOK THAT RISK -- THIS GIVES YOU A TAX CREDIT THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH THAT, BUT WE WILL LET YOU CHOOSE WHAT YOU TAKE THOSE DOLLARS. WE WILL LET YOU TAKE THAT MONEY AND EVENTUALLY WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO PASS IT DOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE IT IS ALL ABOUT FREEDOM. THAT IS WHY WE CALL IT THE PATIENT FREEDOM PLAN. IT IS ABOUT GIVING YOU BACK TO FREEDOM THAT WAS ENDOWED IN THE FIRST PLACE BY GOD. IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN LAID OUT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT ALL TOO OFTEN, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AWAY. OBAMACARE HAS FAILED AMERICA OVERALL. IT HAS FAILED INDIVIDUAL AFTER INDIVIDUAL. THERE ARE SOME POINTS OF SUCCESSES, BUT WE CAN POINT TO A BETTER ALTERNATIVE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT IS ABOUT GIVING YOU YOUR MONEY AND YOUR POWER BACK TO CONTROL YOUR OWN LIFE. SIR? >> GOVERNOR, UNDER OBAMACARE, WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF OPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. WE HAVE SEEN HOBBY LOBBY GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR -- ALL THESE LAWSUITS. NONPROFITS, INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES. WHAT DOES THIS PLAN DUE TO HOPEFULLY ELIMINATE THAT? GOV. WALKER: IT PUTS THE POWER BACK IN YOUR HANDS TO MAKE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. IT IS SOMETHING WHERE IT GETS THE GOVERNMENT MANDATE OUT. S OUT. IT SAYS HERE IS WHERE YOU CAN SPEND YOUR MONEY. YOU CAN SPEND IT FOR SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT A GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE FROM THEIR EMPLOYER. IT ELIMINATES ALL THE MANDATES FROM OBAMACARE. IT IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT FREEDOM. IN THE LARGER SENSE, I BELIEVE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES PROTECTS OUR RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE FREEDOM FROM RELIGION. WHETHER YOU ARE CHRISTIAN, JEWISH OR HINDU, THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO PROTECT. THAT IS WHY OUR FOUNDERS WERE SO FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS WERE A PART OF THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE OPPRESSED. THAT IS IMPORTANT FAR BEYOND THIS PLAN. IT IS THE MAKE SURE THE NEXT PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES THAT AND HAS AN ADMINISTRATION AND A CABINET THAT DEFENDS THAT RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] >> I APPRECIATE THAT. GOV. WALKER: TOMORROW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I WILL BE OUT DOING TOWN HALL MEETINGS. I HOPE YOU CAN SHARE THE WORD BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY HOW DO YOU WIN CAMPAIGNS? IT IS THE MESSAGE, MANPOWER AND MONEY. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS HAVING A MESSAGE. THE MANPOWER IS MEN AND WOMEN AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, SHARING THE MESSAGE. IF NOTHING ELSE, YOU CAN BE AN ECHO CHAMBER TO PASS THE WORDS ONTO OTHERS ABOUT TODAY. WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES TALKED ABOUT ALONG THE WAY. WE WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE IF YOU WANT TO GET THINGS DONE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN. WE HAD A PLAN WHEN WE CAME IN. WE STARTED WORKING ON THE PLAN BEFORE THE ELECTION. WE WERE WORKING ON IT SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND WHEN I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE. THAT IS WHY WE ACTED ON THINGS SO QUICKLY ACROSS THE RIVER OVER IN WISCONSIN. WE HAD A PLAN AND READY TO GO. WE WERE NOT JUST TALKING CAMPAIGN PROMISES. WE KNEW IN A BLUE STATE LIKE MINE, IF I DID NOT DO WHAT I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO, THE VOTERS HAD EVERY RIGHT TO THROW ME OUT. I WON THREE TIMES IN FOUR YEARS WITH INDEPENDENTS AND MAYBE A FEW DISCERNING DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE IN THE END, WHAT I THINK AMERICANS WANT MORE THAN EVER, THEY WANT PEOPLE THAT WILL STAND UP AND BOLDLY TELL THEM WHAT THEY WILL DO DURING THEIR CAMPAIGN. AND THEN THEY WANT THE CONFIDENCE THAT THAT CANDIDATE WILL ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THOSE PROMISES ONCE THEY ARE IN OFFICE. YOU MAY LOOK AT MY RECORD AND YOU MAY SAY I LIKE SOME THINGS AND NOT OTHERS. HOPEFULLY, YOU LIKE MORE THAN NOT. YOU MAY LIKE IT ALL. THE ONE THING I HOPE PEOPLE SEE -- EVEN FOR THOSE THAT DON'T APPROVE OF EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE, THE ONE THING YOU WILL NOT DOUBT IS I WILL DO WHAT I SAID IT WILL DO. MY INTEREST HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PURE. THE REASON I DECIDED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR WAS NOT BECAUSE WE WERE MAD AND UPSET THAT OUR STATE WAS HEADING TO THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE WERE UPSET BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO BOYS GROWING UP. I'M GLAD THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE RAN. WHEN WE HAD THE DEATH THREATS, THE PROTESTERS, THE RECALL -- WE WERE TARGETED AS THE NUMBER ONE TARGET IN AMERICA BY THESE LIBERAL GROUPS -- IT WAS WORTH IT, BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT FOR MATT AND ALEX AND THE OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS, ALL THOSE THAT ARE YET TO BE BORN, THAT THEY WILL GROW UP IN A STATE THAT IS GREATER THAN THE ONE WE GREW UP IN. NOW TO ME MORE THAN EVER IN THIS COUNTRY AND PEOPLE ASK WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS, WHY ARE YOU DOING ALL THIS HASSLE -- IT IS FOR MATT AND ALEX AND EACH OF YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS, NIECES AND NEPHEWS. IT IS WORTH IT NOT JUST A RUN, BUT TO SEE THOSE PROMISES FALL THROUGH TO ACTION. THAT IS WHY I THINK WE NEED SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON. A NEW FACE. SOMEONE THAT IS PROVEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO WHAT THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO DO. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL GET FROM ME IF YOU ELECT ME AS YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE, YOUR SUPPORT AND MOST OF ALL, YOUR PRAISE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?111596-1/hillary-clinton-town-hall-north-las-vegas-nevada,"Hillary Clinton Town Hall in North Las Vegas, Nevada",Hillary Rodham Clinton,"WELCOME. WE ARE A PROUD MINNESOTA MANUFACTURING FACILITY. WE ARE IN OUR 70TH YEAR OF BUSINESS. WE MAKE A LOT OF THE PARTS YOU SEE BEHIND ME. THE INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ARE THE LAWN CARE INDUSTRIES, AGRICULTURE. WE ARE HONORED TODAY TO HAVE SCOTT WALKER AND HIS CAMPAIGN TODAY TO UNVEIL HIS ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE. IT IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE AT THIS TIME TO INTRODUCE OUR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. HE WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE HOUSE IN 2010 AND ELECTED SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN 2014. HE'S A PRIVATE PILOT AND HE IS SINGLE, GIRLS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] >> QUITE AN INTRODUCTION. THANKS, STEVE, FOR HOSTING US HERE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A WONDERFUL FACILITY THAT YOU RUN. WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE YOU AS AN EMPLOYER. I'M VERY EXCITED TO HAVE GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER IN MINNESOTA. GOVERNOR WALKER IS A BOLD CONSERVATIVE REFORMER AND HE HAS BROUGHT UNBELIEVABLE POLICIES THAT HAVE TURNED AROUND THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. WHEN HE TOOK OVER IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, IT WAS A MESS. THEY HAD A $4 BILLION DEFICIT AND LOST JOBS AND HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ABOVE 8%. GOVERNOR WALKER LOWERED TAXES TO SPUR JOB GROWTH, BUT REFORMS IN PLACE THAT ELIMINATED WAGE FRAUD . AND REALLY TURNED THE STATE OF WISCONSIN AROUND. WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK HE HAS DONE. I'M VERY PROUD THAT HE HAS COME TO MINNESOTA TO ANNOUNCE HIS OBAMACARE REFORMS. THERE IS REALLY NO BETTER PLACE THAN MINNESOTA TO ANNOUNCE THESE REFORMS. WE HAVE SEEN THE WORST OF THE WORST OF OBAMA CARE IN MINNESOTA. 140,000 MINNESOTANS HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. PEOPLE HAVE LOST THE CHOICE THEY HAD. IN SOME CASES, THEY HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION FOR HEALTH COVERAGE. FRANKLY, ALL THE WHILE DURING THE WORST OF THE WORST, DEMOCRATS GAVE THE OBAMACARE EXECUTIVES IN MINNESOTA BONUSES TO REWARD THEM. WE NEED NEW, BOLD REFORM LIKE SCOTT WALKER HAS BROUGHT TO WISCONSIN HERE IN MINNESOTA AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IF YOU FOLLOWED THE NEWS YESTERDAY, YOU KNOW SCOTT WALKER IS READY FOR THE TASK AND IS ON INTIMIDATED. SCOTT WALKER IS THE BOLD REFORM LEADER WE NEED NOT ONLY IN MINNESOTA, BUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THANKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. CHRIS HAS DONE A SPECTACULAR JOB HERE IN MINNESOTA. I WAS PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU EARLIER IN THE CAPITAL. I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR OUR TEAM. WE ARE GOING TO COMPETE FOR THE CAUCUS AND WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE YOUR LEADERSHIP, GRASSROOTS WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE EMPLOYEES HERE. THANK YOU FOR HOSTING. I WAS KIDDING ON THE TOUR, I KNOW WHERE NOT TO STICK MY FINGER AND WHERE NOT TO TURN OFF THE LIGHT CURTAINS. YOU ARE LITERALLY FUELING THE ECONOMY HERE IN MINNESOTA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND THANKS TO EVERYBODY ELSE, ALL THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS FOR BEING HERE. AND HEARING A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR TODAY. WE WILL TALK ABOUT OBAMACARE. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AMERICA IS A CAN-DO KIND OF COUNTRY. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON THAT CAN'T GET THE JOB DONE. WASHINGTON IS 68 SQUARE MILES SURROUNDED BY REALITY. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WASHINGTON, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH WASHINGTON. I FEEL YOUR PAIN. I AM FED UP, TOO. WE WERE TOLD BY REPUBLICAN LEADERS DURING THE CAMPAIGNS LAST YEAR THAT WE JUST NEEDED A REPUBLICAN SENATE TO BE ELECTED TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. HERE WE SIT. BOTH CHAMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED SINCE JANUARY BY REPUBLICANS. THERE IS NOT A BILL ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, AMERICANS WANT MORE THAN JUST CAMPAIGN PROMISES. THEY WANT RESULTS. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. THAT IS SOMETHING I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND IT, I AM NOT INTIMIDATED. EVEN YESTERDAY AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR ON THE SOAPBOX, I WAS NOT INTIMIDATED BY THE PEOPLE THERE. LONG BEFORE WE TOOK ON UNION BOSSES IN MY STATE AND BEFORE WE TOOK ON LIBERAL SPECIAL INTEREST FROM WASHINGTON, WE TOOK ON SOME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN MY OWN PARTY. BACK IN 2010, WHEN I WAS THINKING OF RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS UPSET WITH THE DIRECTION MY STATE WAS HEADING. I THOUGHT IT WAS HEADING THE WRONG DIRECTION. A WEEK AFTER THE ELECTION, WE HAD ALL THE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS TOGETHER AND I SAID TO THEM THE VOTERS, THAT VOTERS HAD TOLD US THEY WANTED US TO BE BIG AND BOLD. THERE WERE SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WHO WERE UNEASY WITH THE IDEA OF TAKING ON THE STATUS QUO. THE SESSION WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. I SAID TO ALL OF THOSE LAWMAKERS INCLUDING SOME THAT WERE UNEASY, I SAID IT IS PUT UP OR SHUT UP TIME. THAT WAS THE HEADLINE. IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE. I HEARD WHAT VOTERS SAID. IF WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO, THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO THROW US OUT. I WAS PROUD NOT LONG AFTER TAKING OFFICE, THE VERY DAY I TOOK OFFICE, I TOOK THE OATH AND AUTHORIZED OUR STATE TO JOIN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. THEN WE SET OUT ON A PATH OF BOLD REFORMS. WE TOOK ON UNION BOSSES. THEN WE FIXED THE $3.6 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT. WE CUT TAXES BY $2 BILLION. WE DEFUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD. WE PUT A PHOTO ID REQUIREMENT TO VOTE IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. WE NOW ENSURE THAT EVERY ADULT IN OUR STATE WHO IS ABLE TO WORK MUST BE ABLE TO PASS A DRUG TEST BEFORE THEY GET A WELFARE CHECK. WE DID ALL THOSE THINGS. WE WENT BIG AND BOLD AND WE GOT RESULTS. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: WE TOOK ACTION. IN ADDITION TO THAT FIRST DAY, AUTHORIZING THE STATE TO JOIN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. NOT LONG AFTER THAT, I TURNED DOWN A STATE EXCHANGE UNDER OBAMACARE. AS YOU MENTIONED, MR. SPEAKER, HAVING LOOKED AT MINNESOTA AND MARYLAND, I AM GLAD LOOKING AT THE OTHER PROBLEMS STATES ARE HAVING THAT I MADE THAT DECISION SEVERAL YEARS AGO. UNLIKE MY FRIENDS RICK PERRY AND BOBBY JINDAL, I TURNED DOWN A MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER OBAMACARE. THAT WAS TOUGH IN A BLUE STATE LIKE WISCONSIN. THERE WERE SOME REPUBLICANS THAT WANTED US TO GRAB THE MONEY BUT WE TURNED IT DOWN BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO REPEAL. FAMILIES IN CHARGE OF THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. OTHER STATES WERE EXPANDING TO IT AND ADDING UNDERNEATH IT. WE SHOWED WE COULD GET RESULTS. I AM PROUD TO SAY THE STATE OF WISCONSIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY, EVERYONE LIVING IN POVERTY IS COVERED UNDER MEDICAID. WE TOOK EVERYONE ABOVE POVERTY AND TRANSITIONED IT TO THE MARKETPLACE. IT STILL PROTECTS TAXPAYERS. EVEN THE NONPARTISAN KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION LOOKED AT WHAT WE DID AND SAID WISCONSIN WAS THE ONLY STATE OUT OF ALL OF THE STATES THAT DID NOT TAKE THE MEDICAID EXPANSION, THE ONLY STATE THAT DID NOT HAVE A COVERAGE GAP. IN OTHER WORDS, WE GOT RESULTS WHILE STILL STAYING TRUE TO OUR COMMON SENSE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. IF INNOVATIVE REFORMS LIKE THAT CAN WORK IN A BLUE STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY CAN WORK FOR AMERICA. THERE IS NO DOUBT GOING FORWARD THEY CAN WORK FOR AMERICA. I AM WILLING TO STAND UP AGAINST ANYONE, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF MY OWN PARTY, TO GET THE JOB DONE. WE ARE NOT INTIMIDATED. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE TALK IS CHEAP IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS. IN OUR CASE, WE FOUGHT, WE WON, WE GOT RESULTS, WE DID ALL OF THAT IN A STATE THAT HASN'T GONE REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT SINCE 1984. WE WERE NOT INTIMIDATED, WE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. THE PEOPLE PAYING THE TAX BILLS GOING FORWARD. NOW WE HAVE A PLAN FOR AMERICA THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. IT IS SIMPLE. IT STARTS WITH A PREMISE THAT ON MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND LEGISLATION TO THE CONGRESS TO ONCE AND FOR ALL REPEAL OBAMACARE ENTIRELY. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: ALONG WITH THAT WE WILL REPLACE IT IN A WAY THAT PUTS PATIENTS AND FAMILIES, YOUR FAMILIES, BACK IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. WE CALL IT THE DAY ONE PATIENT FREEDOM PLAN. AS I MENTIONED, THE FIRST PART IS REPEALING OBAMACARE ENTIRELY. SOME ASK HOW YOU WILL DO THAT. YOU HAVE A CONGRESS OUT THERE, IT IS SIMPLE. WE MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENS. WE HAVE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE ENTIRELY, LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL. WE HAVE TO REPEAL EVERY PART OF IT, INCLUDING THE PARTS NANCY PELOSI DID NOT BOTHER TO READ. I TALKED TO REFORMERS LIKE PAUL RYAN AND TOM PRICE AND OTHERS OUT THERE. THEY ARE READY TO WORK WITH US TO PASS REFORMS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE NEED TO HAVE AN INCENTIVE OUT THERE TO DO THAT, THE GREAT WAY TO MOTIVATE THE CONGRESS TO PASS THE REFORMS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME OBAMACARE RULES THE REST OF AMERICA HAS BEEN PUT UNDER. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: ON MY FIRST DAY, I WILL ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WILL PULL BACK ON THE SPECIAL DEAL THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PROVIDED FOR CONGRESS. THEY PULLED OUT OF THIS LIKE THEY OFTEN EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM OTHER THINGS WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER LAWS. WE WILL DO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT REMOVES THE DEAL THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT IN PLACE AND MAKE THEM LIVE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS. ONCE THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE OBAMACARE PREMIUM INCREASES THAT MANY AMERICANS HAVE BEEN UNDER, I HAVE AN IDEA THAT WILL LIGHT A FIRE UNDER CONGRESS TO GET THINGS MOVING. A LOT OF CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT REPEALING OBAMACARE AND WE HAVE A PLAN TO MAKE SURE CONGRESS ACTS ON REFORMS RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME RULES THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THE NEXT PART IS ONCE WE GET ESTABLISHED THAT WE WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE, THE NEXT SCREEN I WILL SHOW YOU IS ABOUT ENSURING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY FOR EVERYONE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH INSURANCE. WE WANT AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE FOR EVERYONE. WE WILL HAVE LOWER PREMIUMS. ONCE YOU REPEAL OBAMACARE AND GET RID OF THOSE REGULATIONS, THAT IS PART OF THE PLAN, ONCE YOU ENCOURAGE MORE COMPETITION WHEN IT COMES TO INSURERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, YOU WILL SEE PREMIUMS GO DOWN FOR EVERYONE. INCLUDING FOR PEOPLE WHO GET IT FROM PLACES LIKE THIS. WE WILL SEE A REDUCTION OF PREMIUMS, WHICH IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SECOND, FOR THOSE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT GET IT FROM THEIR EMPLOYER, WE WILL HAVE AN OPTION THERE AS WELL. WE PROVIDE A TAX THAT IT THAT IS NOT TIED INTO AGE SO IT APPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD SO AS PEOPLE -- WE HAVE A GREAT TAX CREDIT UP THERE THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE NO MATTER WHETHER IT IS SOMEONE WHO IS WORKING PART-TIME AND GOING TO SCHOOL OR MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE WHO DECIDED THEY WANTED TO START A NEW BUSINESS. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. THIS GIVES THEM AN AFFORDABLE WAY TO GET AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. WE APPLY FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE. YOU ALL KNOW THIS -- WE PROVIDE, IN ADDITION, $1000 IN A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT TO PUT INTO HSAS. ON THE HEALTH SAVING ACCOUNTS. WE LIFT THE LIMITS. WE ARE RAISING THE LIMITS IN TERMS OF CONTRIBUTION LIMITS FOR BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO PASS IT ON TO YOUR CHILDREN AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. WE WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MORE OF YOUR OWN MONEY. YOU WILL DO MORE TO MANAGE YOUR HEALTH CARE AND YOUR HEALTH. IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE DOLLARS. IT IS PUTTING FREEDOM BACK IN THE HANDS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILIES TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH CARE AND MONEY. YOU ARE ALSO SEEING BESIDES THE CREDITS AND INCENTIVES, WE WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE ANYWHERE, IN ANY STATE. IN THE PAST, YOU HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED OVER STATE LINES. WHEREVER YOU THINK IS THE BEST SPOT, YOU CAN BUY IT OUTSIDE OF YOUR EMPLOYER, WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO BUY IT ANYWHERE IN ANY STATE. WE WILL MAKE SURE, THIS IS IMPORTANT, WHILE WE ARE REPEALING OBAMACARE, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE HEARD, WE WILL MAKE SURE PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, YOU WILL NOT GET BUMPED OFF YOUR COVERAGE. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO FACE HUGE INCREASES JUST BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OR BECAUSE YOU GET SICK. THAT IS THE FIRST PHASE. ENSURE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE OPTIONS FOR EVERYONE. THE NEXT THING IS MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE BY EMPOWERING THE STATES. ONE PART OF THAT IS THE ABILITY TO OVERSEE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE BACK TO THE STATE. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: THAT'S ONE OF THOSE WHERE THE SPEAKER AND I KNOW THIS BUT I KNOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN YOU SEND POWER OUT OF WASHINGTON TO THE STATE LEVEL. THAT IS WHAT WE DO WITH THIS PLAN. IN TERMS OF OVERSEEING HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATES, HAVE IT DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL. ON TOP OF THAT, WE WANT TO REFORM MEDICAID. THAT MEANS FIXING IT AND SENDING IT BACK TO THE STATES. I HAVE SEEN FOR YEARS WE HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS I AM PROUD OF IS EVEN UNDER OBAMACARE, WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE EVERY PERSON LIVING IN POVERTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY STATE'S HISTORY WAS COVERED. WE DID IT WITHOUT TAKING THE SO-CALLED FREE FEDERAL MONEY. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE FEDERAL MONEY. WE'RE THE ONES THAT PAY FOR IT OUT THERE. WE NEED TO PUT THOSE ABILITIES AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TRULY NEEDY PEOPLE GET THE CARE THEY NEED, YOU NEED TO SEND THE POWER BACK TO THE STATE WHERE IT CAN BE MORE INNOVATIVE AND MORE LIKELY TO GET THE JOB DONE. THEY ARE CARING FOR THE PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN MINNESOTA, WISCONSIN, IOWA. PART OF THIS IS JUST TAKING POWER FROM WASHINGTON AND SENDING IT BACK TO THE STATES. THE NEXT THING IS IMPROVING AND INCREASING THE QUALITY AND CHOICE THROUGH INNOVATION. WE ALLOW PEOPLE, CONSUMERS, TO GO OUT AND POOL TOGETHER AND PURCHASE HEALTH CARE. IT COULD BE A GROUP OF FARMERS OR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE WANT ANOTHER OPTION FROM THE CHOICES WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO POOL RESOURCES AND GO OUT THERE AND PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE TOGETHER. IT IS ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE MORE FREEDOM. WE ALSO PUT IN PLACE INCENTIVES FOR WELLNESS. THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT EMPLOYERS WORKING WITH EMPLOYEES ON WELLNESS PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE HEALTH. THAT IS BEYOND JUST TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE COST. IT IS IMPROVING HEALTH. YOU DEAL WITH CHRONIC DISEASES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE, THAT HELPS LOWER HEALTH CARE COST AS OPPOSED TO ALTERNATIVES. UNDER OBAMACARE, IT LEADS TO RATIONING. WE WANT PEOPLE TO LEAD HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER LIVES. THIS ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO PARTICIPATE IN WELLNESS PROGRAMS. WE ALSO PUT IN PLACE REFORMS FOR LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES. REFORM THE PROCESS FOR LONG-TERM CARE. THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF US IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT FINANCIAL STABILITY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS FOR YOUR FAMILY. WE PUT IN PLACE CHANGES SO YOU HAVE MORE STABILITY AND CONFIDENCE, NOT JUST FOR YOURSELF, BUT FOR THOSE IN YOUR FAMILY. WE ALLOW FOR MORE OPTIONS OUT THERE. SO THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE LONG-TERM CARE IN PEOPLE'S HOMES, NOT JUST HAVING TO GO TO CERTAIN PLACES. MORE ABILITIES TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM CARE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN. FINALLY, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR STATES TO PURSUE LAWSUIT REFORM AS IT APPLIES TO MEDICAL PROCEDURE. I WANT HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO GO FORWARD WITH PROCEDURES AND TESTS AND DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON MEDICALLY NECESSARY DECISIONS, NOT BASED ON TRYING TO AVOID THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. WE ARE GOING TO LET THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE MEDICAL NEEDS, NOT JUST IN TRYING TO AVOID FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BY PRACTICING DEFENSIVE MEDICINE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WILL HELP LOWER COSTS AND INCREASE CHOICES AND PUSH INNOVATION. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER BUT HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR IT AND HOW DOES IT APPLY TO OBAMACARE? FOR US, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR OURSELVES AND FAMILIES, BUT ALSO FOR TAXPAYERS. OUR PLAN IS FOR LONG-TERM CARE, GIVING PEOPLE MORE OPTIONS WHETHER YOU GET IT THROUGH EMPLOYERS. THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER-BASED HEALTH CARE TO INCREASE TAX CREDITS AND ALLOWING FAMILIES TO GET IT AT A REASONABLE RATE. WHETHER IT IS LOOKING AT PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO ACCOUNT. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ABOUT PUTTING MORE MONEY AND YOUR POCKET AND GIVING YOU MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR MONEY. THIS IS GOOD FOR FAMILIES AND PATIENTS AND YOUR FINANCIAL STABILITY. FOR ALL OF US, IT IS GOOD FOR TAXPAYERS. WE ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE UNDER OBAMACARE. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT BY REPEALING OBAMACARE ENTIRELY, WE ARE GETTING RID OF THE SPENDING AND TAXES. WHICH MEANS THIS ENDS UP BEING A TAX CUT TO ABOUT A TRILLION DOLLARS. WE GET RID OF THE TAXES AND SPENDING. THE TRILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN OBAMACARE. WE GIVE THAT BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE PROVIDE MORE RELIEF ON TOP OF THAT WITH THE HSA. WE PUT MORE MONEY BACK IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S HANDS. I THINK IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX RELIEF PLANS WE HAVE HAD WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TAX RELIEF PLANS IN THE PAST 40 SOME YEARS. THAT'LL HAVE A IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THE NATION'S ECONOMY. IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT OBAMACARE, YOU THINK ABOUT CANDIDATES TALKING ABOUT OBAMACARE AND WHAT THEY WILL DO TO REPEAL IT. WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW CANDIDATES THAT HAS LAID A PLAN OUT, NOT JUST FOR HOW TO REPEAL IT BUT WHAT TO DO IN ITS PLACE, BUT WE LAY OUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE NATION IS UNDERGOING A CRITICAL FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR DEBT AND DEFICIT PROBLEMS. NONE OF THESE PLANS WILL ADD TO THAT I. IN THIS CASE, OUR PLAN IS COST NEUTRAL. WE PAY FOR THIS AND THE CREDITS OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS. BY REFORMING THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE TAX TREATS SOME OF THE GOLDPLATED HEALTH CARE PLANS AND BY REFORMING AND FIXING MEDICAID BY SENDING IT BACK TO THE STATES WHERE IT IS MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO PEOPLE SERVED BY THESE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE AND WANT PATIENTS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. WE WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T BREAK THE BANK. THIS IS COST NEUTRAL. GOING FORWARD, WE FOUND AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT THAT DOESN'T ADD TO THE DEFICIT PROBLEMS, PROVIDES MASSIVE TAX RELIEF AND PUTS ALL OF YOU AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA IN CHARGE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. THIS IS THE LAYOUT. WE THINK IT IS A GREAT PLAN. IT IS A GREAT WAY TO REPEAL OBAMACARE AND NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT. FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, IT IS A GOOD PUNCHLINE IN YOUR SPEECHES. WE ACTUALLY NOW HAVE A PLAN TO GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT SHOWS EXACTLY HOW WE WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE. NOT JUST SAYING IT, BUT BY PUTTING IN PLACE EXECUTIVE ACTION THAT WILL FORCE CONGRESS TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME RULES EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO LIVE UNDER. WE THINK THAT IS THE LIGHT, THE FIRE UNDER CONGRESS TO MAKE THEM ACT IMMEDIATELY. THERE ARE GREAT REFORMERS THAT WANT TO. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT MIGHT NOT WANT TO. WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ANYONE ON TO GET THE JOB DONE. THAT IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT. THEY WANT YOU TO DELIVER ON THOSE PROMISES. [APPLAUSE] GOV. WALKER: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES US UNIQUE -- WE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT THINGS. WE FIGHT, WE WIN, WE GET RESULTS AND WE DO IT WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER, THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT. THINK ABOUT THE CONTRAST. WE KNOW WE HAVE A PLAN ON THE TABLE TO GET OBAMACARE REPEALED. A PLAN TO GET PATIENTS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE. TO GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON. THINK ABOUT THIS -- AS BAD AS THINGS HAVE BEEN UNDER OBAMACARE, THEY WOULD ONLY GET WORSE UNDER HILLARY CLINTON. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE HAD WITH OBAMACARE BUT THEY CAME LONG AFTER HILLARY CLINTON BUT THIS IDEA OUT. IN THE LATE 1990'S, THERE WAS HILLARY CARE. BACK IN THE EARLY 1990'S, THERE WAS HILLARY CARE. EVEN IN 2008 IN THE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY, HILLARY CLINTON LAID OUT A PLAN THAT INCLUDED THE FEDERAL MANDATE AND MANY PROVISIONS THAT ARE NOW IN OBAMACARE. WE WERE TOLD UNDER OBAMACARE THAT IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. THAT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE YEAR NATIONALLY. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DUMPED OFF THEIR HEALTH CARE INSURANCE BY THEIR EMPLOYER BY THE PRESSURES OF OBAMACARE. THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PREMIUMS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF. SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE HAVE LOST COVERAGE AND SEEN PREMIUMS GO UP. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE TOLD THIS IS NOT A TAX, BUT WE SEE THIS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS. THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC ABOUT OBAMACARE. THEY ONLY GET WORSE UNDER HILLARY CLINTON. SHE HAS A MUCH BIGGER GOLDEN WHAT WE SEE IN OBAMACARE. VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE NOVEMBER. I NENEXT NOVEMBER. I WANT TO BE THE CANDIDATE THAT SAYS HERE IS HOW WE WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE. IT IS NOT ABOUT MORE GOVERNMENT. IT IS ABOUT PUTTING FREEDOM INTO YOUR HANDS AND THE HANDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN THE HANDS OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY GOING FORWARD. THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. IT IS ALL ABOUT FREEDOM. IF YOU WANT A CANDIDATE WHO WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT OBAMACARE, WILL ACTUALLY GET CONGRESS TO REPEAL IT, GET CONGRESS TO PASS REFORMS, PUT REFORMS IN PLACE THAT PUTS YOU BACK IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS, THAT LETS YOU CONTROL YOUR MONEY AND FREEDOM GOING FORWARD, I'M YOUR CANDIDATE. FOUR YEARS AGO, LIKE WE SAW A LITTLE BIT IN IOWA, WE TOOK ON OVER 100,000 PROTESTERS. WE TOOK ON THE BIG GOVERNMENT UNION BOSSES. WE TOOK ON THE LIBERAL SPECIAL INTERESTS IN WASHINGTON WHO'S BEEN ALL SORTS OF MONEY AND RESOURCES TO TAKE US OUT. YES, WE EVEN TOOK ON SOMEONE IN OUR OWN PARTY EARLY ON TO SAY THE VOTERS IN MY STATE BACK IN 2010 SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE. THEY WERE WILLING TO MAKE A CHANGE BECAUSE THEY WANTED BIG, BOLD REFORMS AND THEY WANTED RESULTS AND THAT IS WHAT WE GAVE THEM. IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE AS PRESIDENT, WE WILL NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THINGS -- WE FIGHT, WE WIN, WE GET RESULTS AND WE DON'T COMPROMISE OUR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS RACE. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT AND LISTENING TO ME TODAY. AS I MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA WHO ARE JUST AS FRUSTRATED, JUST AS ANGRY WITH WASHINGTON AND EVEN SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS AS I AM. IF IT WAS JUST ABOUT ANGER, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CHECKED OUT. THEY WHAT HAVE BECOME CYNICAL. WHAT GIVES ME HOPE IS I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON AMERICA AND I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE EITHER. THAT IS WHY YOU ARE HERE INTERESTED. -- AND INTERESTED. YOU WANT PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO YOU, DO THE SORTS OF THINGS YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE IN WASHINGTON. I MAY NOT BE THE FLASHIEST. I MAY NOT HAVE THE PIZZAZZ. BUT I HOPE YOU SEE ACROSS AMERICA, I THINK LIKE YOU THINK. MY FAMILY LIVES LIKE YOUR FAMILY DOES. WE WANT THE SAME THINGS YOU DO AND WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN. WE HAVEN'T TESTED IN A WAY THAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE HAS BEEN TESTED. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, WE HAVE A PLAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN. WE WILL STAND UP FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND JUST. WE WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. WITH THAT, LET'S TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. [APPLAUSE] >> [INDISCERNIBLE] I WOULD SAY ONE THING -- DO YOU THINK UNDERWRITING NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET? I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT A MODEL. WE DID ALLOW PEOPLE WITH UNINSURABLE CONDITIONS TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE. THE MODEL NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. BUT WHEN YOU GIVE ALL PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERAGE WITH NO UNDERWRITING, THE WORST COVERAGE WITH BENEFITS BREAKS THE PLAN. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO RESEARCH THAT. I THINK MINNESOTA'S MODEL DID WELL. GOV. WALKER: THAT IS A GREAT POINT. WE HAVE A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN WISCONSIN. UNFORTUNATELY IN OBAMACARE, IT FORCES OUT OF THAT. THIS PLAN WOULD ALLOW THINGS LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN GOING FORWARD. TO GO BACK. WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS OF OURS WHO ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE GETTING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE WHO THEN UNDER OBAMACARE WERE MAKING TOO MUCH, NOT AL LOT, BUT TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR THE ASSISTANCE. UNDER OUR PLAN, BECAUSE IT IS NOT INCOME-BASED, IT IS BASED ON AGE, THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT AND WOULD USE IT FOR A PLAN JUST LIKE THAT. THAT IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF THINGS WE ENVISIONED WITH THIS PLAN. >> I LIKE YOUR IDEAS. THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE RELATED TO THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS -- YOU MENTIONED THE HIGH RISK POOL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT WOULD WORK? GOV. WALKER: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WE WOULD EMPOWER IT IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT. IT WOULD BE IN THE STATE LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL. STATES COULD SEE HEALTH INSURANCE IN GENERAL, BUT IT WOULD ALLOW STATES TO DO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THIS EMPOWERS THEM. IN OTHER STATES, WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. WE HAD TO CHANGE OUT OF THAT BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. THIS RESTORES THAT FREEDOM. >> ONE OF THE AREAS WE SEE AT OFFICIAL INCREASES IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL SIDE. WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT WE CAN DO TO CHANGE THE WAY -- IS THERE A HAPPY MEDIUM THAT COULD STILL ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND AT THE SAME TIME CUT BACK ON SOME OF THE CRAZY COSTS FOR NEW DRUGS. GOV. WALKER: I THINK WHEN YOU SEE THE MARKETPLACE NOW BEING MORE ACTIVE IN A COMPETITIVE CENTS, WHETHER SENSE, THAT WOULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ENCOURAGING LOWER-COST BECAUSE PEOPLE WHAT HAVE A GREATER HAND. THE MORE PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WATCH WHERE THEIR HEALTH HCARE DOLLARS ARE SPENT, THEY WILL HOLD THOSE ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE. MOST OF US PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR CELL PHONE PLANS THEN ARE HEALTH CARE PLANS. IT IS VERY ATTENTIVE TO PEOPLE MANAGING TO HOW THEY ARE DOING IT. I THINK THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR. A LITTLE TWEAK IN TERMS OF PUTTING INCENTIVES IN FOR STATES TO DO WILL ALS LAWSUIT REFORMS. IT WILL OFFSET FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE STATES TO PUT IN PLACE REASONABLE REFORMS BUT ALSO HELP WITH THE COSTS. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MINNESOTA. MY QUESTION IS MORE ON SALESMANSHIP OF YOUR PLAN. I LIVED IN ENGLAND, SO I KNOW WHAT IT DOES TO A COUNTRY WITH GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE. HOW DO YOU SELL YOUR PLAN SO YOU ARE NOT JUST A BIG BAD REPUBLICAN TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S INSURANCE UNDER OBAMACARE? GOV. WALKER: THE ONE THING THAT HAS INTEREST OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- I CAME OUT AGAINST THIS WHEN IRAN IN 2010. RAN IN 2010. AFTER I TOOK MY OATH, I TURNED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WISCONSIN TO GIVE THEM AUTHORIZATION TO JOIN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. I DID NOT DO THE MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER OBAMACARE. I WAS UP FRONT. EARLY ON, I THINK SOME PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. OVER TIME HERE AND SOME EXAMPLES WE GAVE, PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED. THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF OBAMACARE WAS NOT WHAT WAS PROMISED. IF IT HAD DONE EVERYTHING, I WOULD STILL HAVE CONCERNS, BUT IT WOULD BE A HARDER BATTLE. WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE TOLD THINGS LIKE IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND THAT ENDED UP BEING NOT JUST ME SAYING IT, BUT POLITIFAX SAYING IT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE YEAR -- WHEN PEOPLE ARE TOLD ALL THESE PROMISES. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A 19% INCREASE IN PREMIUM COSTS FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE, YOUNGER EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA JUST UNDER THE OBAMACARE STATE EXCHANGE. THE MORE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, LOOKED INTO THIS, THE MORE I THINK AMERICANS ARE SAYING OBAMACARE HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS EXPECTATIONS. THE KEY IS THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY YOU ARE AGAINST OBAMACARE. YOU HAVE TO SHOW WHAT YOU ARE FOR AND WHY IT IS BETTER. IT CARES FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT HELPS PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET INSURANCE FROM THEIR EMPLOYER. IT ALLOWS FOR FARMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS GROUPS TO POOL TOGETHER. IT PROVIDES FOR ALL THESE RATE OPTIONS, BUT IT DOES NOT DICTATED THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT. I THINK IN GENERAL, NOT JUST WHEN IT COMES WITH A HEALTH CARE PLAN BUT OVERALL, THE CONTRAST BETWEEN ME AND HILLARY CLINTON IS SIMPLE. HILLARY CLINTON IS IN A TOP-DOWN APPROACH OF GOVERNMENT. THAT IS WHAT WE GET OUT OF WASHINGTON. IT MAY BE WORST IN WHAT WE HAVE OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA. IN CONTRAST, I BELIEVE YOU GROW THE ECONOMY FROM THE GROUND UP. IT IS NEW AND FRESH AND ORGANIC. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T HURT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR, GO OUT AND START YOUR OWN CAREER, BUILD YOUR OWN LIFE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. THAT IS FREEDOM. I THINK MOST AMERICANS STILL FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IN THAT ESSENCE OF FREEDOM. THEY WANT A MORE FREE COUNTRY AND THEY WANT LEADERS TO RECOGNIZE THAT SENSE THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT PERSONAL FREEDOM. DO WE WANT TO HELP OUR NEIGHBOR THAT IS IN TROUBLE? ABSOLUTELY. THIS DOES. THIS SAYS IF YOU ARE DOWN AND OUT, WE STILL PROVIDE HELP FOR THOSE THAT ARE NEEDY. WE EMPOWER THE STATES THAT ARE MUCH BETTER AT DOING IT. WE SAY TO FOLKS WHO MAY BE IN POSITION WE JUST STARTED A COMPANY, LEFT THE COMPANY AND STARTED ON THE WRONG, TOOK THAT RISK -- THIS GIVES YOU A TAX CREDIT THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH THAT, BUT WE WILL LET YOU CHOOSE WHAT YOU TAKE THOSE DOLLARS. WE WILL LET YOU TAKE THAT MONEY AND EVENTUALLY WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO PASS IT DOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE IT IS ALL ABOUT FREEDOM. THAT IS WHY WE CALL IT THE PATIENT FREEDOM PLAN. IT IS ABOUT GIVING YOU BACK TO FREEDOM THAT WAS ENDOWED IN THE FIRST PLACE BY GOD. IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN LAID OUT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT ALL TOO OFTEN, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AWAY. OBAMACARE HAS FAILED AMERICA OVERALL. IT HAS FAILED INDIVIDUAL AFTER INDIVIDUAL. THERE ARE SOME POINTS OF SUCCESSES, BUT WE CAN POINT TO A BETTER ALTERNATIVE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT IS ABOUT GIVING YOU YOUR MONEY AND YOUR POWER BACK TO CONTROL YOUR OWN LIFE. SIR? >> GOVERNOR, UNDER OBAMACARE, WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF OPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. WE HAVE SEEN HOBBY LOBBY GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR -- ALL THESE LAWSUITS. NONPROFITS, INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES. WHAT DOES THIS PLAN DUE TO HOPEFULLY ELIMINATE THAT? GOV. WALKER: IT PUTS THE POWER BACK IN YOUR HANDS TO MAKE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. IT IS SOMETHING WHERE IT GETS THE GOVERNMENT MANDATE OUT. S OUT. IT SAYS HERE IS WHERE YOU CAN SPEND YOUR MONEY. YOU CAN SPEND IT FOR SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT A GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE FROM THEIR EMPLOYER. IT ELIMINATES ALL THE MANDATES FROM OBAMACARE. IT IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT FREEDOM. IN THE LARGER SENSE, I BELIEVE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES PROTECTS OUR RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE FREEDOM FROM RELIGION. WHETHER YOU ARE CHRISTIAN, JEWISH OR HINDU, THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO PROTECT. THAT IS WHY OUR FOUNDERS WERE SO FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS WERE A PART OF THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE OPPRESSED. THAT IS IMPORTANT FAR BEYOND THIS PLAN. IT IS THE MAKE SURE THE NEXT PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES THAT AND HAS AN ADMINISTRATION AND A CABINET THAT DEFENDS THAT RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] >> I APPRECIATE THAT. GOV. WALKER: TOMORROW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I WILL BE OUT DOING TOWN HALL MEETINGS. I HOPE YOU CAN SHARE THE WORD BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY HOW DO YOU WIN CAMPAIGNS? IT IS THE MESSAGE, MANPOWER AND MONEY. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS HAVING A MESSAGE. THE MANPOWER IS MEN AND WOMEN AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, SHARING THE MESSAGE. IF NOTHING ELSE, YOU CAN BE AN ECHO CHAMBER TO PASS THE WORDS ONTO OTHERS ABOUT TODAY. WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES TALKED ABOUT ALONG THE WAY. WE WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE IF YOU WANT TO GET THINGS DONE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN. WE HAD A PLAN WHEN WE CAME IN. WE STARTED WORKING ON THE PLAN BEFORE THE ELECTION. WE WERE WORKING ON IT SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND WHEN I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE. THAT IS WHY WE ACTED ON THINGS SO QUICKLY ACROSS THE RIVER OVER IN WISCONSIN. WE HAD A PLAN AND READY TO GO. WE WERE NOT JUST TALKING CAMPAIGN PROMISES. WE KNEW IN A BLUE STATE LIKE MINE, IF I DID NOT DO WHAT I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO, THE VOTERS HAD EVERY RIGHT TO THROW ME OUT. I WON THREE TIMES IN FOUR YEARS WITH INDEPENDENTS AND MAYBE A FEW DISCERNING DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE IN THE END, WHAT I THINK AMERICANS WANT MORE THAN EVER, THEY WANT PEOPLE THAT WILL STAND UP AND BOLDLY TELL THEM WHAT THEY WILL DO DURING THEIR CAMPAIGN. AND THEN THEY WANT THE CONFIDENCE THAT THAT CANDIDATE WILL ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THOSE PROMISES ONCE THEY ARE IN OFFICE. YOU MAY LOOK AT MY RECORD AND YOU MAY SAY I LIKE SOME THINGS AND NOT OTHERS. HOPEFULLY, YOU LIKE MORE THAN NOT. YOU MAY LIKE IT ALL. THE ONE THING I HOPE PEOPLE SEE -- EVEN FOR THOSE THAT DON'T APPROVE OF EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE, THE ONE THING YOU WILL NOT DOUBT IS I WILL DO WHAT I SAID IT WILL DO. MY INTEREST HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PURE. THE REASON I DECIDED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR WAS NOT BECAUSE WE WERE MAD AND UPSET THAT OUR STATE WAS HEADING TO THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE WERE UPSET BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO BOYS GROWING UP. I'M GLAD THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE RAN. WHEN WE HAD THE DEATH THREATS, THE PROTESTERS, THE RECALL -- WE WERE TARGETED AS THE NUMBER ONE TARGET IN AMERICA BY THESE LIBERAL GROUPS -- IT WAS WORTH IT, BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT FOR MATT AND ALEX AND THE OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS, ALL THOSE THAT ARE YET TO BE BORN, THAT THEY WILL GROW UP IN A STATE THAT IS GREATER THAN THE ONE WE GREW UP IN. NOW TO ME MORE THAN EVER IN THIS COUNTRY AND PEOPLE ASK WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS, WHY ARE YOU DOING ALL THIS HASSLE -- IT IS FOR MATT AND ALEX AND EACH OF YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS, NIECES AND NEPHEWS. IT IS WORTH IT NOT JUST A RUN, BUT TO SEE THOSE PROMISES FALL THROUGH TO ACTION. THAT IS WHY I THINK WE NEED SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON. A NEW FACE. SOMEONE THAT IS PROVEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO WHAT THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO DO. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL GET FROM ME IF YOU ELECT ME AS YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE, YOUR SUPPORT AND MOST OF ALL, YOUR PRAISE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327523-3/former-senator-jim-webb-dva-iowa-state-fair,Former Senator Jim Webb (D-VA) at the Iowa State Fair,Jim Webb,"NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM FORMER VIRGINIA SENATOR JIM WEBB AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR. MR. WEBB SERVED AS SECRETARY OF THE NAVY. SENATOR WEBB: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. I KNOW THIS IS A 20 MINUTE TIMED EVENT. THE FIRST RULE YOU LEARN IN MARINE CORPS LEADERSHIP IS YOU NEVER PUT YOUR CROWDS FACE INTO THE SUN, WHETHER TALKING TO MARINES OR CITIZENS OUT HERE TODAY, SO I APOLOGIZE HAVING TO PUT YOU THROUGH BEING IN THE SUN DURING THIS NEXT 20 MINUTES. I'VE BEEN HERE AND ABOUT -- BEEN HERE ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF. I THOUGHT IT WALKING THROUGH AND SAYING HELLO TO PEOPLE. IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MEET PEOPLE AND LISTEN TO THEIR VIEWS, AND BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING ELSE, I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I BELONG TO ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE FRATERNITIES IN THE WORLD. IT IS A SATURDAY THAT HAS TO GO ACROSS ALL BUSINESS AND ETHNIC LINES, AND THAT IS THE U.S. MARINE CORPS AND ONE OF MY GREAT FRIENDS WHO SERVED IN THE PLATOON IN VIETNAM IS WITH US TODAY. HIS NAME IS DAN BROOME. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE IN THE INFANTRY DURING THAT TIME, IT WAS A BRUTAL TIME. WE LOST THREE TIMES AS MANY MARINES IN THE VIETNAM WAR AS WERE IN THE ENTIRE KOREAN WAR. IN 1969, MORE AMERICANS DIED, AND IN FACT, TWICE AS MANY AMERICANS DIED IN VIETNAM AS HAVE BEEN LOST IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN COMBINED IN THE LAST 12 YEARS OF WAR. IT IS ALWAYS A GREAT HONOR FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MY THANKS TO THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED WITH US AND YESTERDAY WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF WHEN DAN BROOME WAS WOUNDED. HE WAS WOUNDED TWICE. IT IS GREAT THAT HE IS WITH US. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR WEBB: ALSO, GENERAL WASHINGTON, I GOT TO MEET HIM BACKSTAGE. I WAS WANTED TO MEET GENERAL WASHINGTON, BECAUSE MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S SERVED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR UNDER GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON. THOSE OF YOU WHO REMEMBER THE ENCAMPMENTS OF VALLEY FORGE ACROSS THE DELAWARE, GENERAL WASHINGTON REMINDED ME OF HOW MUCH HE APPRECIATED HIS VIRGINIA SOLDIERS DURING THAT ENGAGEMENT. I WAS ALSO GLAD TO SEE THAT GOVERNOR HUCKABEE PRECEDED ME. MY MOTHER IS FROM ARKANSAS AND I'VE BEEN TO ARKANSAS MANY, MANY TIMES. AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE HIS VIEWS IN THIS ELECTION PROCESS. ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN THIS SHORT TIMEFRAME IS OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS GOING THROUGH A VERY EMOTIONAL PROCESS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE DEBATE THAT IS GOING ON ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE BOTHERING PEOPLE AND THE ATTENTION THAT SOME OF THE CANDIDATES WHO ARE MORE ON THE EXTREME ARE GETTING IN THE MEDIA, AND THE WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO GO, THE ONE THING I WOULD ASK YOU WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHO YOU WANT FOR YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT IS, WHEN ALL OF THIS COOL DOWN AND -- COMES DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHO YOU WANT AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, WHO YOU WANT HAS -- WHO HAS A RECORD OF DEMONSTRATING JUDGMENT ACROSS PARTY LINES, I HOPE YOU WILL LOOK AT MY CAREER. YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE BURDEN OF BEING COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND MAKING THESE ULTIMATE DECISIONS ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY AND WHEN TO USE MILITARY FORCE, AND WHAT IT IS WISE NOT TO USE MILITARY FORCE. I HAVE BEEN AROUND THE MILITARY MY ENTIRE LIFE. I GREW UP IN THE MILITARY. I WAS HONORED TO SERVE AS A MARINE IN VIETNAM. I SPENT FIVE YEARS AT THE PENTAGON, ONE AS A MARINE, AND FOR AS -- FOUR AS ASSISTANT SECRETARY IN THE NAVY. I WAS IN BEIRUT WHEN OUR MARINES WERE IN BEIRUT JUST BEFORE THE BOMBING THAT KILLED MORE THAN 220 AMERICANS IN ONE DAY. I WAS IN AFGHANISTAN AS AN EMBEDDED JOURNALIST. AND THE EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD IN THE SENATE AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AND THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS PREPARED ME IN THE BEST WAY THAT ANYONE CAN BE PREPARED TO BE YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THE SECOND THING I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS A BETTER COUNTRY IN TERMS OF ISSUES LIKE ECONOMIC FAIRNESS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. I'VE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THE BREAKING POINT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP AND OUR WORKING PEOPLE FOR 10 YEARS NOW. IT WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY ISSUES THAT I PUT INTO MY SENATE CAMPAIGN IN 2000. IT WAS THE FIRST -- IN 2006. IT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE THAT I STATED IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH. WE HAVE A LONG RECORD HERE. AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WE ARE THE MOST UNIQUE SOCIETY ON EARTH. WE ARE THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. WE WANT TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE AMERICAN DREAM HAS THREE PIECES TO IT. THE FIRST IS, IF YOU HAVE YOUR IDEAS TOGETHER, IF YOU CAN GET YOURSELF INTO THE PROCESS, YOU CAN SHOOT THE MOON. YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY. WE WANT TO PRESERVE THAT. THE SECOND THING IS, WE ARE NOT DOING OUR JOB RIGHT AS YOUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS UNLESS WE INSIST THAT ALONG THAT JOURNEY EVERYONE HAS ABSOLUTE FAIRNESS. EVERYONE HAS ABSOLUTE ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND THE THIRD PART OF THAT IS THAT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN ON HARD TIMES, FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN RETIREMENT, FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED DISABILITY, THIS COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS GUARANTEED A SAFETY NET UNDER THE PEOPLE. THAT IS THE AMERICAN TRIFECTA, THE DREAM AT THE TOP, FAIRNESS ALONG THE WAY, AND THE SAFETY NET UNDER OUR PEOPLE. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT WE HAVE THAT SYSTEM IN PLACE ECONOMICALLY RIGHT NOW. I'VE HEARD OTHER PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE FIVE BILLIONAIRES AT THE TOP WHO ARE CONTROLLING A LOT OF HOW OUR ECONOMIC PROCESS WORKS, AND IN A WAY THEY ARE KIND OF BOTH RIGHT. IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THIS RECESSION THAT WE ENDURED GOING INTO 2008 AND 2009 AND HOW WE HAVE CLIMBED BACK OUT OF IT, IN APRIL OF 2009 AS WE STARTED COMING BACK OUT OF IT, THE STOCK MARKET HAS A MOST TRIPLED. IT HAS GONE FROM A LITTLE BIT ABOVE 6000 AND ABOVE 18,000. IF YOU OWN STOCK, IF YOU HAVE CAPITAL ASSET, YOU ARE PROBABLY DOING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW. AT THE SAME TIME, WAGES AND SALARIES FOR OUR WORKING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FLAT, AND ACTUALLY HAVE GONE DOWN, AS HAVE LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESSES. SO IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE FLOW OF CAPITAL, OF OWNING STOCKS, REAL ESTATE, THOSE SORTS OF THINGS, YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT DOING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AMERICAN WORKER, WHO IS THE HARDEST, MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKER IN THE WORLD, GETS A SHARE OF THIS ECONOMY AS WE BRING IT BACK. [APPLAUSE] THE ONE THING I CAN GUARANTEE YOU, IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD I HAVE PUT ON THE TABLE OVER MANY YEARS WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT, IS THAT I CAN TAKE COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND WORK WITH PEOPLE FROM ACROSS A PHILOSOPHICAL SPECTRUM AND ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE. I'M VERY PROUD OF THE POST-9/11 G.I. BILL. I WROTE THIS BILL. I ACTUALLY WROTE IT BEFORE I WENT INTO THE SENATE. I INTRODUCED IT BEFORE I WENT INTO OFFICE. AND WE DEVELOPED A LEADERSHIP PROTOTYPE IN TERMS OF THE SENATE AS FAR AS HOW YOU CAN WORK ACROSS THE AISLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THIS WAS NOT AN EASY LIST. --LIFT. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION OPPOSE THIS G.I. BILL. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE AMERICAN MILITARY. THE EXACT OPPOSITE OCCURRED. AND IN 16 MONTHS, WORKING WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER, WE CAST THE GREATEST G.I. BILL IN HISTORY, AND NOW MORE THAN 11 MILLION GIS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT PAYS THEIR TUITION, BUYS THEIR BOOKS, AND GIVE THEM A MONTHLY STIPEND. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. [APPLAUSE] WE TOOK THE SAME APPROACH IN TERMS OF TRYING TO SOLVE OUR BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY. I STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS WHEN I WAS RUNNING IN THE SENATE. WE SPENT 2.5 YEARS OF HEARINGS LISTENING TO DIFFERENT APPROACHES FROM ACROSS THE PHILOSOPHICAL SPECTRUM. WE PUT THIS ISSUE INTO THE NATIONAL DEBATE. WE TOOK A LOT OF HITS ALONG THE WAY. BUT WE GOT PEOPLE ACROSS THE PHILOSOPHICAL SPECTRUM. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE ANY ISSUE IN FRONT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS THAT HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION, THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE, ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE ACLU AND THE MARIJUANA PROJECTS, WE PULLED IT OFF. WE GOT PEOPLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU AS YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT IF YOU WILL SUPPORT ME, AND PARTICULARLY RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT, BUT I HAVE TIME TO TAKE QUESTIONS. YES, SIR? >> TAKE YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, SENATOR WEBB. AS A VOTER IN IOWA, I BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN ALL ACROSS THE WORLD HAVE THE RIGHT TO GROW IN THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. ONE OF THE WAYS WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THAT IS BY SUPPORTING EARLY CHILDHOOD NUTRITION AND EDUCATION. IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU COMMIT TO CREATING A PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE TO FUND PROGRAMS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION? SENATOR WEBB: THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND NEW PRINT -- AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS, ETC. I'M NOT POINT TO SAY RIGHT NOW THAT I WILL SIGN A PETITION TO DO ANYTHING, BUT I WILL TELL YOU I WILL FOCUS ON THIS PROBLEM. I DON'T FIND PLEDGES. I PLEDGE THAT I WILL GIVE YOU MY LEADERSHIP. -- I DON'T SIGN PLEDGES. I PLEDGE THAT I WILL GIVE YOU MY LEADERSHIP. >> IN THE 20TH CENTURY, WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT? SENATOR WEBB: I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT PARTY YOU ARE IN, BUT THERE IS ONE ON EITHER SIDE. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FOR WHAT HE DID. MY MOTHER GREW UP IN UTTER POVERTY IN EAST ARKANSAS. SHE WAS ONE OF EIGHT CHILDREN, THREE OF WHOM DIED IN CHILDHOOD, NOT CHILDBIRTH, CHILDHOOD. HER FATHER DIED WHEN SHE WAS 10 BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MEDICAL CARE FOR A FRACTURED HIP. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT STEPPED FORWARD AND PUT PROGRAMS INTO PLACE, CREATED THE TBA, PUT WORK OUT THERE. MY GRANDMOTHER COULD NOT WORK. THERE WAS NOTHING OUT THERE IN THIS RURAL AREA AFTER MY GRANDFATHER DIED. BUT SHE FINALLY GOT A JOB THROUGH ONE OF THE ROOSEVELT PROGRAMS. SOCIAL SECURITY, BACK WHEN IT WAS CREATED, PEOPLE WERE SAYING IT WAS A SOCIALIST PROGRAM. I DOUBT THERE IS ANYONE OUT HERE WHO WANTS TO STOP THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK. I LIKE MINE. THE OTHER FAVORITE IS RONALD REAGAN. I SERVED IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. I WILL TELL YOU, THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION DID A TERRIFIC JOB, WHETHER YOU AGREE POLITICALLY WITH THEM OR NOT, OF PUTTING STRONG PEOPLE INTO THE ADMINISTRATION, GIVING THEM GUIDANCE AND HAVING A STEP FORWARD AND LEAD. AND IN A WET ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL DO THAT. WE WILL BRING THE GREATEST MINDS IN AMERICA TO THE TABLE, GIVEN DIRECTION AS TO WHERE WE WANT THIS COUNTRY TO GO, AND HAVE THEM LEAD. >> THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE CONCERNED WITH LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY BECAUSE OF BIG MONEY. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS? SENATOR WEBB: THE QUESTION IS, WHAT I DO TO GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. I WILL TELL YOU, BIG MONEY IS HAVING A VERY DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON OUR DEMOCRACY, PARTICULARLY THE CITIZENS UNITED CASE. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR WEBB: THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THE POWER OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR TO SHAPE THE ISSUES BEING DEBATED RIGHT NOW. I WILL SAY TWO THINGS TO YOU. FIRST, I AM ON BOUGHT -- I AM NOT BOUGHT AND I AM NOT BOSS I WILL LISTEN TO EVERYONE, BUT I HAVE MY OWN MIND ANDED. YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF MY CAREER. I HAVE PEOPLE SAYING I LIKE THE SUPER PAC'S. THE IDEA IS, YOU CAN ONLY TO BETWEEN $700 FOR MY ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT YOU CAN ROCK -- YOU CAN ONLY GIVE ME $2700 FOR MY ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT YOU CAN WALK ACROSS THE STREET AND GIVE ME MUCH MORE FOR THE SUPER PAC. IF YOU THINK THAT IS WRONG, WHY ARE YOU TAKING THE MONEY? IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT, THEN VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO WON'T DO IT. WHICH IS ME, BY THE WAY. [LAUGHTER] SENATOR WEBB: YES, RIGHT HERE. >> HOW DO YOU STAND ON THE PIPELINE? SENATOR WEBB: I SUPPORT THE PIPELINE. IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, IT IS NEUTRAL. YOU CAN COME HERE TO THE NORTHERN PART OF IOWA AND WATCH THESE TRAINS AND THE ACCIDENTS THEY ARE HAVING AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF HAVING TO HAUL THE OIL DOWN IN THAT WAY. ON BALANCE, I THINK IT IS GOOD. IT IS GOOD FOR JOBS. WE ARE GAINING THE KIND OF INDEPENDENCE WE NEED FOR OUR ENERGY SOURCES. AND BY THE WAY, I'M OPEN TO ALL OPTIONS ON ENERGY, BUT I WOULD SUPPORT THE PIPELINE. YES, SIR. >> [INAUDIBLE] SENATOR WEBB: THE QUESTION IS, DO I SUPPORT THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS. I SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY AND I THINK IOWA IS AN AREA WHERE IT COULD WORK. I HAVE VISITED A WIND FARM AND GOT AN NATION OF HOW IT WORKS. I HAVE VISITED AN ETHANOL PLANT AND I'M VERY IMPRESSED NOT ONLY WITH THE ETHANOL PROGRAM, BUT THE ADVANCES THEY ARE MAKING SCIENTIFICALLY IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF STUFF NOT BEING USED. AND BY THE WAY, IMA PROPONENT OF NUCLEAR POWER -- I AM A PROPONENT OF NUCLEAR POWER. I WENT TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY AND I SAW THE BRIGHTEST MINDS GOING INTO THAT PROGRAM. WE HAVE THE SAFEST NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE THE BEST MANAGED AND TOTALLY CLEAN. >> YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN PEOPLE DON'T AGREE ON WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE? HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE THAT? SENATOR WEBB: I TALK ABOUT UNITING OUR COUNTRY AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH YOU? WELL, THE FIRST THING YOU LEARN IN ANY LEADERSHIP POSITION, WHETHER MILITARY OR BUSINESS OR GOVERNMENT, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE WHO WILL DISAGREE WITH YOU. AND WE BUILD THE MOST CREATIVE SOCIETY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS AND WE WORKED THEM OUT AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. TRUST ME, I WAS ELECTED IN VIRGINIA. I WAS A SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA. THAT IS A DEMOGRAPHIC MICROCOSM OF THE COUNTRY. ON ANY GIVEN DAY ON ANY ISSUE, 40% OF THE PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA ARE ANGRY AT THE PEOPLE LEADING THEM. IT COULD BE THE PEOPLE IN THE FAR SOUTHWEST, WHERE THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE SOCIALLY OR THE: THE NORTH. LEADERSHIP IS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND GETTING THEM TO TALK ABOUT THINGS. I THINK WE DID THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN ON CRIMINAL ISSUES AND FEDERAL JUSTICE ISSUES. YOU NEED A LEADER WHO WILL STAND UP AND LOOKED FOR THE FUTURE, MAKE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND TAKE THE HITS, INSTEAD OF PLAYING IT SAFE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY THIS PARTICULAR CROWD WOULD WANT TO GO. THAT IS WHAT LEADERSHIP IS ALL ABOUT. YES, SIR. >> AMERICORPS HAS BEEN A SUCCESS STORY FOR 20 YEARS. NEARLY ONE MILLION AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SERVED IN AMERICA OR AM I BUT CONGRESS WANTS TO -- IN AMERICORPS, BUT CONGRESS WAS TO CUT ITS FUNDING IN HALF. IF YOU ARE ELECTED PRESIDENT, WILL YOU KEEP AMERICORPS TO HOPE -- HELP BUILD OUR COUNTRY? SENATOR WEBB: I WILL NOT TELL YOU THAT I WILL SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I DO SUPPORT FINDING WAYS TO PUT YOUNG AMERICANS INTO AREAS OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT AFFECT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, THAT AFFECT THE DEGRADATION NOT ONLY IN THE CITIES, BUT IN AREAS LIKE THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM, IN TERMS OF EDUCATION, LET'S REMEMBER TWO THINGS. I ONLY HAVE A MINUTE HERE, BUT LETS HER MEMBER TWO THINGS. ONE IS, ONLY ABOUT 75% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN FINISH HIGH SCHOOL TODAY. WE ARE NOT FOCUSING ON THAT PROBLEM. WE TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVES. HOW DO WE TAKE THAT PERSON, WHO WHEN THEY MAYBE GET TO BE 20 OR 30 YEARS OLD WANTS IRAN ACT OF TO GET -- WANTS A WAY BACK UP TO GET AN EDUCATION. I BELIEVE ONE OF THE WAYS WE CAN MOTIVATE YOUNG PEOPLE IS TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN PROGRAMS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE THAT ALSO ADDRESS THEIR EDUCATION. I BELIEVE IN THAT AND IF YOU WILL SUPPORT ME, I BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY TIME IS UP.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?328035-1/governor-scott-walker-rwi-remarks-eureka-college,Governor Scott Walker (R-WI) Remarks at Eureka College,Scott Walker,"JEREMY CORB YN. >> REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL OF LOUISIANA SPOKE AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB THURSDAY. THE USE OF THE PLATFORM TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK ON ANOTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP. HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND SAID CONGRESSIONAL -- GOVENOR WALKER: GOOD MORNING. IT IS A GREAT DAY TO BE HERE, ISN'T IT? CH MY NAME IS CHUCK ERICKSONUCK: -- CHUCK: MY NAME IS CHUCK ERICKSON. IS AN HONOR TO BE INTRODUCING THE GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN, A MAN I HAVE HONORED AS A TRUE CONSERVATIVE. IN HIS BOOK, GOVERNOR WALKER STATED THAT CONSERVATIVES NEED TO STOP PLAYING BY THE RULES SET BY THE LEFT. WITH CREATIVITY AND A LITTLE INNOVATION, WE CAN DEFINE THE DEBATE ON OUR TERMS. THE ADDED, ""WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES PROVIDE YOU WITH A CHANCE TO TAKE BIG, BOLD, DECISIVE ACTIONS, SEES IT. -- SEIZE IT."" AND SEES IT HE DID -- SEIZE IT NEEDED. IT IS NOT JUST TALK THE TALK, HE WALKED THE WALK. IN HIS FIRST TERM, HE TOOK ON UNION BOSSES, FREEING SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HIRE THE BEST FEATURES AND PRIORITIZE SPENDING -- TEACHERS AND PRIORITIZE SPENDING. THE CLOSED A DEFICIT AND DELIVERED TO BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX RELIEF. PROPERTY TAXES IN HIS STATE OR LOWER TODAY THAN WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE. HE HAS OVERSEEN THE CREATION OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN WISCONSIN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. HE WILL CONTINUE TO TEAR DOWN BARRIERS UNTIL EVERYONE WHO WANTS A JOB CAN FIND A JOB. DESPITE THE TAX RELIEF, DESPITE THE JOB CREATION, AND DESPITE SAVING TEACHERS FROM LAYOFFS, THE BIG GOVERNMENT UNION BOSSES WERE NOT HAPPY. IN 2012 THEY ORCHESTRATED A RECALL ELECTION, BUT THEY UNDERESTIMATED SCOTT WALKER. HE BECAME THE FIRST GOVERNOR IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO WIN A RECALL ELECTION. IT WENT ON TO WIN REELECTION FOR A FULL TERM IN 2014. IN CASE YOU'RE ARE NOT KEEPING TRACK, THAT IS THREE ELECTION VICTORIES IN FOUR YEARS. WHILE ACCOMPLISHING CONSERVATIVE REFORMS, AS YOU NOTED IN HIS BOOK, ""AND INTIMIDATED,"" -- ""UNINTIMIDATED,"" IS BROUGHT ABOUT OTHER CONSERVATIVE REFORMS LIKE STOPPING FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. IN HIS SECOND TERM AS GOVERNOR, SCOTT WALKER CONTINUES TO DELIVER RESULTS. HE SIGHED RIGHT TO WORK LEGISLATION, EARNING PRAISE FROM CONSERVATIVES AND CRITICISM FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. GOVERNOR WALKER FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES THAT WORK IN WISCONSIN CAN WORK IN AMERICA AND HE IS READY TO SHARE HIS VISION WITH THE COUNTRY. ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME WE SEND SOMEBODY TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WHO ACTUALLY HAS EXPERIENCE DELIVERING PROVEN CONSERVATIVE REFORM? NOT TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT IT IS NOT ABOUT FLASHY TALK OR DEBATE BUT ABOUT US, THE PEOPLE. FINALLY, ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL, WHEN HE IS NOT TRAVELING OR WORKING IN WISCONSIN, YOU CAN FIND THIS PREACHER'S SON AND FOOTBALL FAN AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE AND SON, OR OUTRIGHT IN HIS HARLEY. -- OUT RIDING HIS HARLEY. PLEASE WELCOME THE 45TH GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN, SCOTT WALKER. [APPLAUSE] GOVENOR WALKER: THANKS, CHUCK. THANKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT GREAT INTRODUCTION AND THANKS FOR COMING OUT. THANKS TO YOUR RICA FOR HOSTING US. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE ON THIS STAGE WHERE RONALD REAGAN FOUND HIS VOICE AS A STUDENT AT EUREKA COLLEGE. WHAT A REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY. SOME OF YOU KNOW THIS BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR, MY WIFE WHO WAS WITH ME, THE FIRST LADY OF WISCONSIN, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME, WE CELEBRATED OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY RIGHT HERE ON FEBRUARY 6 AT EUREKA. SHE WOULD TELL YOU THAT I REMEMBER THE WEDDING ANNIVERSARY BECAUSE IT IS RONALD REAGAN'S BIRTHDAY. I LIKE TO THINK IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND BUT EITHER WAY IT REALLY IS AN HONOR TO BE BACK HERE AT THE ALMANAC OR OF THE 40TH PRESIDENT -- ALMA MATTER OF THE 40TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. RONALD REAGAN HELPED TO SHAPE MY VIEW OF THE WORLD. WHEN I THINK BACK TO HIS FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS WHEN HE STATED ""WE SHOULD ALL REMEMBER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT CREATE THE STATES, THE STATES CREATED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT."" THAT IS WHY I WORK TO TAKE POWER OUT OF WASHINGTON AND SEND IT BACK TO THE STATES ACROSS THIS GREAT COUNTRY. THAT IS TRUE REFORM. I THINK ABOUT RONALD REAGAN AND HOW DURING MY TIME, NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE AGE OF THE STUDENTS HERE, RONALD REAGAN HELPED TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY BY LOWERING TAXES AND GETTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES. IN DOING SO, THOSE POLICIES BROUGHT ABOUT ONE OF THE LONGEST SUSTAINED PERIODS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN U.S. HISTORY. THAT IS WHY I WORKED TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF OUR LIVES AND REDUCE THE SIZE. THAT IS GROWTH. RONALD REAGAN REBUILT THE MILITARY. IN TURN, HELPS TO STAND UP FOR OUR ALLIES, STAND UP AGAINST OUR ENEMIES, AND WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR STRONG AMERICAN VALUES . SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT THAT BUT YOU WANT ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST PEACEFUL TIMES IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. RONALD REAGAN BELIEVED IN PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. I HOPE TO FOLLOW HIS LEAD. PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY. RONALD REAGAN WAS NOT JUST A CONSERVATIVE OR A REPUBLICAN. HE WAS AN ETERNAL OPTIMIST AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I SHOW THAT OPTIMISM. BECAUSE YOU SEE TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, WE NEED A LEADER IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CARES MORE ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION THAN JUST THE NEXT ELECTION. WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO IS WILLING TO GO ""BECAUSE YOU SEE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO -- TO GO VICTIM GO BOLD BECAUSE AS YOU SEE -- BIG AND GO BOLD BECAUSE AS YOU SEE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ELECT A CONSERVATIVE, YOU NEED TO ELECT A REFORMER. WE CELEBRATED OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY ON THE HUNDRED ANNIVERSARY OF RONALD REAGAN'S BIRTH. I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE I WAS AT. IT IS DANGEROUS TO SAY THIS IN ILLINOIS BUT I WAS AT THE SUPER BOWL WATCHING THE GREEN BAY PACKERS. THAT IS ANOTHER STORY. I BROUGHT WITH ME A CUBS FAN AS WELL SO THAT IS ALL RIGHT. I SEE A LITTLE GREEN AND GOLD OVER THERE, THANKS. I DO HAVE TO LAUGH, A WEEK AGO MORE THAN BRINGING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER I HAVE A COUPLE BOTH WEARING BEARS SEARCH WITH A SIGN -- SHITRRTS WITH A SIGN SAYING BEARS FANS FOR WALKER. WE WERE CELEBRATING OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY, CELEBRATING THE PACKERS VICTORY, BUT THE DAY AFTER WE RETURNED HOME AND I HAVE THE ENTIRE CABINET COME OVER FOR DINNER. THE REASON I DID THAT IS THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON BIG REFORMS. I TOLD THE STORY TO THE CABINET ABOUT HOW EARLY ON, RONALD REAGAN TOOK ON SOME REMARKABLE TASKS AND THAT SHAPED HIS PRESIDENCY GOING FORWARD. SPECIFICALLY I TOLD THE STORY ABOUT HOW EARLY ON, ABOUT THIS TIME IN 1981, RONALD REAGAN FIRED THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. THE REASON I TELL THAT STORY, IT IS IRONIC, A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT THIS. THE UNION HAD ACTUALLY ENDORSED PRESIDENT, THEN CANDIDATE REAGAN. IT WAS NOT ABOUT THE POLITICS. IT WAS CLEARLY ABOUT PRINCIPLE. REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ARE, YOU CANNOT VIOLATE THE LAW. THE GIVE THEM WARNING AND AFTER 48 HOURS, HE TERMINATED IT. THAT IS A PRETTY BOLD MOVE. IT WAS PRETTY MUCH POLITICALLY RISKY AT THE TIME BECAUSE WHO KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN? HE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE FROM THAT POINT FORWARD ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD, PEOPLE MOVE THE PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS SERIOUS. -- KNEW THE PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS SERIOUS. HE WENT BIG AND HE WENT BOLD AND IT WORKED. I THINK ABOUT THAT OFTEN. BUT IF YOU YEARS AGO, IN 2010, IN MY STATE, THE VOTERS IN MY STATE SHOWS TO SWITCH FROM ALL DEMOCRAT TO ALL REPUBLICAN CONTROL. A PRETTY DRAMATIC CHANGE. I REMEMBER A WEEK AFTER THE ELECTION I MET WITH THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES AND ALSO SAID TO THOSE LAWMAKERS IT IS PUT UP OR SHUT UP TIME. THAT WAS THE HEADLINE IN THE PAPER. THE REASON I SAID THAT IS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE SENT SUBJECT OR MESSAGE, A MANDATE IF YOU WILL. I TOLD THOSE FOLKS IF WE NIBBLE AROUND THE EDGES THEY WILL HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO HIS ROOM WAS OUT. WE NEED TO DELIVER ON CAMPAIGN PROMISES. SO WE DID. WE WENT BIG AND WE WENT BOLD. NOT LONG AFTER THAT, A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROTESTERS CAME INTO OUR STATE. FIRST, IT WAS JUST PEOPLE FROM WISCONSIN. EVENTUALLY ALONG THE WAY THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS WHO CAME IN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN FACT, AFTER A WHILE WHAT WE STARTED TO SEE WERE PEOPLE BEING BUSSED IN BY THE BIG UNION BOSSES FROM PLACES LIKE CHICAGO AND NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON, D.C. YOU SEE, THEY WERE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE US. WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. THEY TRIED TO INTIMIDATE US THAT WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. AT ONE POINT THERE WERE MORE THAN 100,000 PROTESTERS OCCUPIED OUR STATE CAPITAL BUT WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. THEY WENT AFTER ME WITH DEATH THREATS AND WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. THEY WENT AFTER MY FAMILY WITH THREATS BUT WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. THEY WENT AFTER A MEMBER OF THE WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT IN AN ELECTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN INCONSEQUENTIAL. WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. THE DOORBUSTER FEDERAL AND STATE COURT AND WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. THEY WENT AFTER OUR STATE SENATORS AND WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. THEY WENT AFTER ME IN A RECALL ELECTION AND WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. LAST YEAR THEY MADE ME THE NUMBER ONE TARGET IN AMERICA. OF ALL OF THE ELECTIONS, WE WERE THE NUMBER ONE TARGET. AND WE DID NOT BACK DOWN. INSTEAD, WE FOUGHT AND WE WON . WE GOT RESULTS, AND WE DID IT. WE DID IT WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. [APPLAUSE] GOVENOR WALKER: AND WHAT WE DID WAS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING CONSERVATIVE. IT WAS ABOUT COMMON SENSE. WE TOOK OUR OUT OF THE HAND OF THE BIG GOVERNMENT SPECIAL INTERESTS AND WE PUT IT FIRMLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. THAT IS PRO-TAXPAYER. WE PASSED THE RIGHT TO WORK LAW THAT SAYS THAT PEOPLE IN OUR STATE NOW HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE IN A LABOR UNION OR NOT. THAT IS PRO-WORKER. WE FIXED A $3.7 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT. WE DID EARLY ON SO THAT WE COULD SPEND TIME AND EFFORTS HELPING THE PEOPLE, NOT THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE FOCUS ON CREATING MORE JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES. WE PASSED IN OUR BUDGETS $4.7 BILLION WORTH OF TAX RELIEF SO THAT FAMILIES IN OUR STATE, SO THAT FAMILIES IN OUR STATE COULD KEEP MORE OF THEIR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS. IF WE COULD DO -- [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: IF WE CAN DO THOSE KINDS OF COMMON SENSE CONSERVATIVE REFORMS IN A BLUE STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, IMAGINED, IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN DO IN WASHINGTON. WASHINGTON, THINK ABOUT THAT. RESIDENT REAGAN ONCE SAID, WE NEED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WE NEED TO DRAIN THE SLOT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. SADLY, SINCE HE HAS BEEN GONE, THAT SWAMP HAS FILLED BACK IN. I GOT TO TELL YOU, PEOPLE FROM WASHINGTON OR NOT THE PEOPLE TO FIX WASHINGTON. WE NEED A NEW LEADER. WE NEED SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON, SOMEBODY WHO IS ACTUALLY GOTTEN THINGS DONE. WHEN IT IS LEADER THAT WILL REACH HAVE IT ON WASHINGTON AND ONCE AND FOR ALL -- WREACK AVEDON WASHINGTON AND ONCE AND FOR ALL PEOPLE BACK IN CHARGE OF GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: THAT IS WHY I AM HERE. BECAUSE YOU SEE, I AM THAT KIND OF LEADER. WE HAVE IDEAS TO LEAD AS WELL. IN FACT, WE HAVE AN IDEA, WE HAVE AN IDEA TO TAKE AN REPEAL OBAMACARE ONCE AND FOR ALL AND PUT PATIENTS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND HEALTH CARE DOLLARS. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE THOUGHT THE DAY ONE PATIENT FREEDOM PLAN. THE REASON WE CALL IT THAT IS THAT ON DAY ONE I WILL SEND THAT TO CONGRESS. TO GET THEM TO ACT ON IT WHICH IS IMPORTANT, ON DAY ONE, I WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT REQUIRES CONGRESS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THEIR STAFF, WHO LIVE UNDER THE SAME RULE THAT EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA LIVES UNDER. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: YOU SEE, THEY NEED A LITTLE INCENTIVE TO GET THE REPEAL PAST. REMEMBER LAST YEAR? YOU A LOT IN THE CAMPAIGNS ABOUT IF YOU HAD REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES IN DARKNESS AFTER THE 2014 ELECTIONS THEY WOULD VOTE TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE. ALAS, I CHECKED, IT IS AFTER LABOR DAY AND THERE IS -- THE LAST TIME I CHECKED IT IS AFTER LABOR DAY AND THERE IS NO BILL TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE. THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE UPSET WITH WASHINGTON. THAT IS WHY I AM UPSET WITH WASHINGTON. THE NEED TO SHARE A SENSE OF URGENCY. TALK IS CHEAP. WE NEED ACTION. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO WERE PEOPLE OF ACTION. ON THE FIRST DAY I TOOK OFFICE AS GOVERNOR, LITERALLY AFTER I TOOK THE OLD OFFICE, I RETURNED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND GAVE HIM THE LETTER THAT AUTHORIZED WISCONSIN TO JOIN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. EVEN DEMOCRATS WILL BEGRUDGINGLY TELL YOU, THEY WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE ONE THING THEY CAN ALL AGREE ON, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN ALIKE, IF I TELL YOU I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING, I DO IT. I AM NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM WASHINGTON. I AM NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS GOING FORWARD. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND I AM PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I AM THE ONLY MAJOR CANDIDATE THAT HAS A PLAN TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE. SEE, BETWEEN NOW AND WEDNESDAY, I AM GOING TO CHALLENGE THE OTHER MAJOR CANDIDATES THAT WILL BE ON THE STAGE WITH ME AT PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S LIBRARY. I WILL CHALLENGE THOSE CANDIDATES TO SAY THAT IT IS GREAT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, BUT TALK IS CHEAP. WHERE IS YOUR PLAN? AT THE COURAGE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOUR PLAN IS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT REPEAL OBAMACARE UNLESS YOU HAVE A PLAN TO DO IT. WE'VE GOT A PLAN AND OUR PLAN STARTS ON DAY ONE, THE VERY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. THERE IS MORE. ON DAY ONE AS YOUR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I AM GOING TO TERMINATE THE BAD DEAL WITH IRAN ON THE VERY FIRST DAY. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: YOU SEE, THERE ARE OTHER CANDIDATES, INCLUDING SOME REPUBLICANS, HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THAT. THEY THINK IT IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD WAIT ON IT. THERE ARE OTHERS WHO THINK THAT THEY CAN JUST LEAVE THE DEAL IN PLACE AND THEY WILL JUST MAKE IT WORK. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I HAVE LOOKED AT THIS EXTENSIVELY. I HAVE LOOKED AT IT WITH EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. THIS DEAL, THE GOVERNMENT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WITH IRAN, IS BAD FOR AMERICA, IT IS BAD FOR ISRAEL, IT IS BAD FOR THE WORLD. I DO NOT NEED TO WAIT IN A PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO. I DON'T IS A BAD DEAL TODAY AND I WILL TERMINATE THAT ON MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: BUT THERE IS MORE AS WELL. YOU SEE, ON DAY ONE, I AM GOING TO END THE UNLAWFUL EXECUTIVE ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. YOU SEE, FOR YEARS, THE PRESIDENT SAID 22 TIMES THAT HE COULD NOT DO WHAT HE DID LAST NOVEMBER. HE SAID HE WAS NOT THE EMPEROR. HE SAID HE WAS NOT ABOVE THE LAW. AND THEN HE GOT FRUSTRATED AND DID IT ANYWAY. IN FACT, HE WOULD STILL BE DOING IT TODAY WERE IT NOT FOR ME OR 24 OTHER GOVERNORS WHO WENT TO COURT AND SAID IN AMERICA, NO MAN OR WOMAN IS ABOVE THE LAW, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PASS THINGS IN THE CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE LAW. YOU DO NOT GET TO DO IT THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION. AS PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO UNDO THOSE UNLAWFUL ACTIONS ON MY FIRST DAY. I AM NOT GOING TO WAIT, I AM GOING TO DO IT ON DAY ONE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO TELL PEOPLE NOT ABOUT JUST THE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED BUT I AM ANNOUNCING THAT WE HAVE A PLAN TO WRECK HAVOC ON WASHINGTON AND THE PLAN STARTS ON DAY ONE. SO MY PROMISE -- THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND SO MY PROMISE TO ALL OF YOU HERE AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA IS EVERY WEEK, STARTING NEXT WEEK, WE ARE GOING TO LAY OUT ANOTHER ONE OF OUR REFORMS, OUR BIG, BOLD REFORMS, THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO ONE DAY ONE. NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE IN MONDAY IN LAS VEGAS AND WE WILL TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING ON THE BIG GOVERNMENT UNION BOSSES. WE ARE GOING TO DO TO TAKE THE POWER AND PUT IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE AND THE COUNTRY. SIMPLE THINGS LIKE ON DAY ONE I AM GOING TO STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE PAYCHECKS OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FOR POLITICAL UNION DUES. BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK ANY WORKER IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PUT MONEY INTO A POLITICAL FUND THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT CANDIDATES THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT. WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE MONEY FROM YOUR PAYCHECK GO TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY THAT YOU FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED? THAT IS WRONG. YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO -- WE ARE GOING TO START WITH THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO DO MORE TO SHIFT THE POWER. THERE WILL BE MANY MORE, WEEK AFTER WEEK. WE WANT TO BE A CAMPAIGN THAT IS ABOUT SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE YOU SEE, TO WREACK PENTAGON WASHINGTON, WE HAVE HAD THOSE BATTLES -- HAVOK, ON WASHINGTON, WE ARE USED TO THAT, WE HAVE HAD THOSE BATTLES, BUT IT TAKES LEADERS THAT HAVE SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE HEARD POLITICAL RHETORIC. WE NEED SOLUTIONS. CLINICAL RHETORIC DOES NOT COVER IT. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. I ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN, A PLAN OF ACTION, TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD. MY COMMITMENT TO YOU HERE TODAY IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO LAY THAT OUT WEEK BY WEEK BETWEEN NOW AND THE ELECTIONS TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. NOT TO LAY OUT A BUMPER STICKER, NOT TO LAY OUT A TALKING POINT, BUT LITERALLY TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO ON ALL OF THE MAJOR ISSUES AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO START ON DAY ONE. PEOPLE ARE CYNICAL AND UNDERSTANDABLY SO. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT ANGER, IT IS ABOUT URGENCY. ANGER IS A NEGATIVE THING. IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO CHECK OUT. WHAT I SENSE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY. WE NEED LEADERS WHO WILL TELL US WHAT THEY WILL DO AND HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THEY WILL ACTUALLY DO THAT. THAT IS WHAT I DID AS GOVERNOR. THAT IS WHAT I DID AS COUNTY EXECUTIVE. WHEN I LAID OUT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE FIRST DAYS I WAS IN OFFICE. I LAID IT OUT IN A CAR AND TOLD PEOPLE TO -- CARD AND TOLD PEOPLE TO HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE. I STILL RUN INTO DEMOCRATS WHO TELL ME I STILL HAVE YOUR CARD ON MY REFRIGERATOR. BECAUSE I CANNOT BELIEVE SOMEBODY DARED ME TO CHECK TO SEE IF I WOULD DARE AND YOU DID EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS AND FOR THAT I WILL HOPE FOR YOU GOING FORWARD. I THINK THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY FOR. PEOPLE WHO DO NOT JUST SAY THINGS BUT SAY THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO AND HOW I AM GOING TO DO IT. WE NEED LEADERS WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE A PLAN TO MOVE THE COUNTRY FORWARD. TO WREACK HAVOC ON WASHINGTON WE NEED A LEADER WHO HAS BEEN TESTED. WE HAVE SEEN THE MISTAKES THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU PUT SOMEBODY IN PRESIDENT WAS NEVER BEEN IN CHARGE BEFORE. YOU CAN MAKE ALL OF THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER SOUNDS GREAT. BUT IF YOU CANNOT DELIVER ON THOSE PROMISES, TALK IS CHEAP. THAT DOES NOT GET US MOVING FORWARD. IF WE WANT TO WRECK HAVOC ON WASHINGTON WE NEED A LEADER THAT HAS BEEN TESTED AND I HAVE BEEN TESTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER LEADER IN THIS RACE. WHAT IS THE OLD ADAGE? WHAT DOES NOT KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER. IT RETURNS IF I WONDERED IF THAT WAS JUST FIGURATIVE, THE WAY THINGS -- THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WONDERED IF IT WAS JUST FIGURATIVE, THE WAY THINGS WERE GOING. I HAVE PASSED THE TEST TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I AM READY TO LEAVE THIS EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY FILLED WITH EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE GOING FORWARD. -- LEAD THE SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY FILLED WITH EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE GOING FORWARD. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: HERE ON THIS GREAT STAGE, THIS STAGE WERE RONALD REAGAN FOUND HIS VOICE, NOT JUST AS A STUDENT AT YOUR READER, BUT FOR THE NATION AND -- AT YOUR REJECT, BEFORE THE NATION -- EUREKA, BUT FOR THIS NATION AND FOR THIS WORLD. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. WE HAVE TWO SONS, MATTHEW WHO IS A SENIOR AT COLLEGE AND ALEX WHO WAS A JUNIOR. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS. THE REASON WE RAN FOR GOVERNOR IS BECAUSE OF OUR SONS. WE SAW A STATE THAT WAS NOT FITTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE FELT WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THE REASON I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS IN THE SAME VEIN. FOR ME, IT IS ABOUT MATT AND ALEX AND ALL OF YOU HERE, THE YOUNGER ONES AS WELL. THOSE YET TO BE BORN. BECAUSE REALLY THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT ABOUT A BUSINESS OR A HOME OR ANYTHING ELSE OF MATERIAL VALUE. THE AMERICAN DREAM, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND SOMEDAY YOUR GRANDCHILDREN HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN THE ONE YOU INHERITED FROM YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR GRANDPARENTS. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. THAT IS WHY WE TOOK ON ALL THE PRESSURE. THAT IS WHY, BUT IS THE REASON I RAN FOR GOVERNOR BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD 100,000 PROTESTERS, WHEN WE HAD DEATH THREATS, WHEN MY KIDS WERE THREATENED ON FACEBOOK, WHEN AWFUL THINGS WERE SAID ABOUT MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER-IN-LAW AND MY FAMILY, AND THEN ABOUT A TITLE, I WOULD HAVE SAID, THAT IS ENOUGH. I DO NOT NEED THIS JOB. I DO NOT NEED THIS TITLE. INSTEAD IT WAS A GREAT REMINDER FOR ME THAT THE REASON I GOT INTO THIS WAS NOT FOR A POSITION, IT WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT MY CHILDREN AND OTHERS LIKE THEM HAD A BETTER FUTURE. AND I WAS ABLE TO THESE CHALLENGES, AND THEY ARE BIG, DO NOT GET ME WRONG, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE DEBT AND THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT WE HAVE YET TO SEE, YOU LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES OF ISIS AND IRAN AND PLACES AROUND THE WORLD, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. BUT JUST LIKE REAGAN, I AM AN OPTIMIST. I BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN NO CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IS TOO BIG FOR THE RESOLVE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I BELIEVE IF WE HAVE LEADERS THAT THINK MORE ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE NEXT ELECTION, THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER. NOW MORE THAN EVER, WE NEED A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN. A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR REFORM IN WASHINGTON. A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR TRUE ECONOMIC GROWTH, NOT JUST FOR NOW BEFORE THE FUTURE AND FUTURE GENERATIONS -- BUT FOR THE FUTURE AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN ARE SAFE FROM ISIS AND THE THREATS IN THE WORLD. IF YOU ELECT ME AS YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT, I WILL TELL YOU THIS. I WILL NOT BACK DOWN. I WON'T BACK DOWN. I HAVEN'T TESTED, NOT JUST FOR OTHERS, BUT FOR MYSELF. I KNOW I WILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO FACE TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. I WILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM THESE CHALLENGES. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEEDED SOMEBODY WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR YOU. SOMEBODY WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR YOUR FAMILY. SOMEONE WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR AMERICA. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

Kasich,"JEREMY CORB YN. >> REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL OF LOUISIANA SPOKE AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB THURSDAY. THE USE OF THE PLATFORM TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK ON ANOTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP. HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND SAID CONGRESSIONAL -- GOVENOR WALKER: GOOD MORNING. IT IS A GREAT DAY TO BE HERE, ISN'T IT? CH MY NAME IS CHUCK ERICKSONUCK: -- CHUCK: MY NAME IS CHUCK ERICKSON. IS AN HONOR TO BE INTRODUCING THE GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN, A MAN I HAVE HONORED AS A TRUE CONSERVATIVE. IN HIS BOOK, GOVERNOR WALKER STATED THAT CONSERVATIVES NEED TO STOP PLAYING BY THE RULES SET BY THE LEFT. WITH CREATIVITY AND A LITTLE INNOVATION, WE CAN DEFINE THE DEBATE ON OUR TERMS. THE ADDED, ""WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES PROVIDE YOU WITH A CHANCE TO TAKE BIG, BOLD, DECISIVE ACTIONS, SEES IT. -- SEIZE IT."" AND SEES IT HE DID -- SEIZE IT NEEDED. IT IS NOT JUST TALK THE TALK, HE WALKED THE WALK. IN HIS FIRST TERM, HE TOOK ON UNION BOSSES, FREEING SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HIRE THE BEST FEATURES AND PRIORITIZE SPENDING -- TEACHERS AND PRIORITIZE SPENDING. THE CLOSED A DEFICIT AND DELIVERED TO BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX RELIEF. PROPERTY TAXES IN HIS STATE OR LOWER TODAY THAN WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE. HE HAS OVERSEEN THE CREATION OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN WISCONSIN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. HE WILL CONTINUE TO TEAR DOWN BARRIERS UNTIL EVERYONE WHO WANTS A JOB CAN FIND A JOB. DESPITE THE TAX RELIEF, DESPITE THE JOB CREATION, AND DESPITE SAVING TEACHERS FROM LAYOFFS, THE BIG GOVERNMENT UNION BOSSES WERE NOT HAPPY. IN 2012 THEY ORCHESTRATED A RECALL ELECTION, BUT THEY UNDERESTIMATED SCOTT WALKER. HE BECAME THE FIRST GOVERNOR IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO WIN A RECALL ELECTION. IT WENT ON TO WIN REELECTION FOR A FULL TERM IN 2014. IN CASE YOU'RE ARE NOT KEEPING TRACK, THAT IS THREE ELECTION VICTORIES IN FOUR YEARS. WHILE ACCOMPLISHING CONSERVATIVE REFORMS, AS YOU NOTED IN HIS BOOK, ""AND INTIMIDATED,"" -- ""UNINTIMIDATED,"" IS BROUGHT ABOUT OTHER CONSERVATIVE REFORMS LIKE STOPPING FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. IN HIS SECOND TERM AS GOVERNOR, SCOTT WALKER CONTINUES TO DELIVER RESULTS. HE SIGHED RIGHT TO WORK LEGISLATION, EARNING PRAISE FROM CONSERVATIVES AND CRITICISM FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. GOVERNOR WALKER FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES THAT WORK IN WISCONSIN CAN WORK IN AMERICA AND HE IS READY TO SHARE HIS VISION WITH THE COUNTRY. ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME WE SEND SOMEBODY TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WHO ACTUALLY HAS EXPERIENCE DELIVERING PROVEN CONSERVATIVE REFORM? NOT TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT IT IS NOT ABOUT FLASHY TALK OR DEBATE BUT ABOUT US, THE PEOPLE. FINALLY, ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL, WHEN HE IS NOT TRAVELING OR WORKING IN WISCONSIN, YOU CAN FIND THIS PREACHER'S SON AND FOOTBALL FAN AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE AND SON, OR OUTRIGHT IN HIS HARLEY. -- OUT RIDING HIS HARLEY.

IN FACT, WE HAVE AN IDEA, WE HAVE AN IDEA TO TAKE AN REPEAL OBAMACARE ONCE AND FOR ALL AND PUT PATIENTS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND HEALTH CARE DOLLARS. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: WE THOUGHT THE DAY ONE PATIENT FREEDOM PLAN. THE REASON WE CALL IT THAT IS THAT ON DAY ONE I WILL SEND THAT TO CONGRESS. TO GET THEM TO ACT ON IT WHICH IS IMPORTANT, ON DAY ONE, I WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT REQUIRES CONGRESS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THEIR STAFF, WHO LIVE UNDER THE SAME RULE THAT EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA LIVES UNDER. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: YOU SEE, THEY NEED A LITTLE INCENTIVE TO GET THE REPEAL PAST. REMEMBER LAST YEAR? YOU A LOT IN THE CAMPAIGNS ABOUT IF YOU HAD REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES IN DARKNESS AFTER THE 2014 ELECTIONS THEY WOULD VOTE TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE. ALAS, I CHECKED, IT IS AFTER LABOR DAY AND THERE IS -- THE LAST TIME I CHECKED IT IS AFTER LABOR DAY AND THERE IS NO BILL TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE. THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE UPSET WITH WASHINGTON. THAT IS WHY I AM UPSET WITH WASHINGTON. THE NEED TO SHARE A SENSE OF URGENCY. TALK IS CHEAP. WE NEED ACTION. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO WERE PEOPLE OF ACTION. ON THE FIRST DAY I TOOK OFFICE AS GOVERNOR, LITERALLY AFTER I TOOK THE OLD OFFICE, I RETURNED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND GAVE HIM THE LETTER THAT AUTHORIZED WISCONSIN TO JOIN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST OBAMACARE. EVEN DEMOCRATS WILL BEGRUDGINGLY TELL YOU, THEY WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE ONE THING THEY CAN ALL AGREE ON, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN ALIKE, IF I TELL YOU I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING, I DO IT. I AM NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM WASHINGTON. I AM NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS GOING FORWARD. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND I AM PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I AM THE ONLY MAJOR CANDIDATE THAT HAS A PLAN TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE. SEE, BETWEEN NOW AND WEDNESDAY, I AM GOING TO CHALLENGE THE OTHER MAJOR CANDIDATES THAT WILL BE ON THE STAGE WITH ME AT PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S LIBRARY. I WILL CHALLENGE THOSE CANDIDATES TO SAY THAT IT IS GREAT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, BUT TALK IS CHEAP. WHERE IS YOUR PLAN? AT THE COURAGE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOUR PLAN IS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT REPEAL OBAMACARE UNLESS YOU HAVE A PLAN TO DO IT. WE'VE GOT A PLAN AND OUR PLAN STARTS ON DAY ONE, THE VERY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. THERE IS MORE. ON DAY ONE AS YOUR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I AM GOING TO TERMINATE THE BAD DEAL WITH IRAN ON THE VERY FIRST DAY. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: YOU SEE, THERE ARE OTHER CANDIDATES, INCLUDING SOME REPUBLICANS, HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THAT. THEY THINK IT IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD WAIT ON IT. THERE ARE OTHERS WHO THINK THAT THEY CAN JUST LEAVE THE DEAL IN PLACE AND THEY WILL JUST MAKE IT WORK. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I HAVE LOOKED AT THIS EXTENSIVELY. I HAVE LOOKED AT IT WITH EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. THIS DEAL, THE GOVERNMENT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WITH IRAN, IS BAD FOR AMERICA, IT IS BAD FOR ISRAEL, IT IS BAD FOR THE WORLD. I DO NOT NEED TO WAIT IN A PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO. I DON'T IS A BAD DEAL TODAY AND I WILL TERMINATE THAT ON MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: BUT THERE IS MORE AS WELL. YOU SEE, ON DAY ONE, I AM GOING TO END THE UNLAWFUL EXECUTIVE ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. YOU SEE, FOR YEARS, THE PRESIDENT SAID 22 TIMES THAT HE COULD NOT DO WHAT HE DID LAST NOVEMBER. HE SAID HE WAS NOT THE EMPEROR. HE SAID HE WAS NOT ABOVE THE LAW. AND THEN HE GOT FRUSTRATED AND DID IT ANYWAY. IN FACT, HE WOULD STILL BE DOING IT TODAY WERE IT NOT FOR ME OR 24 OTHER GOVERNORS WHO WENT TO COURT AND SAID IN AMERICA, NO MAN OR WOMAN IS ABOVE THE LAW, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PASS THINGS IN THE CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE LAW. YOU DO NOT GET TO DO IT THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION. AS PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO UNDO THOSE UNLAWFUL ACTIONS ON MY FIRST DAY. I AM NOT GOING TO WAIT, I AM GOING TO DO IT ON DAY ONE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO TELL PEOPLE NOT ABOUT JUST THE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED BUT I AM ANNOUNCING THAT WE HAVE A PLAN TO WRECK HAVOC ON WASHINGTON AND THE PLAN STARTS ON DAY ONE. SO MY PROMISE -- THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: AND SO MY PROMISE TO ALL OF YOU HERE AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA IS EVERY WEEK, STARTING NEXT WEEK, WE ARE GOING TO LAY OUT ANOTHER ONE OF OUR REFORMS, OUR BIG, BOLD REFORMS, THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO ONE DAY ONE. NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE IN MONDAY IN LAS VEGAS AND WE WILL TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING ON THE BIG GOVERNMENT UNION BOSSES. WE ARE GOING TO DO TO TAKE THE POWER AND PUT IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE AND THE COUNTRY. SIMPLE THINGS LIKE ON DAY ONE I AM GOING TO STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE PAYCHECKS OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FOR POLITICAL UNION DUES. BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK ANY WORKER IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PUT MONEY INTO A POLITICAL FUND THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT CANDIDATES THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT. WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE MONEY FROM YOUR PAYCHECK GO TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY THAT YOU FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED? THAT IS WRONG. YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO -- WE ARE GOING TO START WITH THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO DO MORE TO SHIFT THE POWER. THERE WILL BE MANY MORE, WEEK AFTER WEEK. WE WANT TO BE A CAMPAIGN THAT IS ABOUT SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE YOU SEE, TO WREACK PENTAGON WASHINGTON, WE HAVE HAD THOSE BATTLES -- HAVOK, ON WASHINGTON, WE ARE USED TO THAT, WE HAVE HAD THOSE BATTLES, BUT IT TAKES LEADERS THAT HAVE SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE HEARD POLITICAL RHETORIC. WE NEED SOLUTIONS. CLINICAL RHETORIC DOES NOT COVER IT. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. I ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN, A PLAN OF ACTION, TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD. MY COMMITMENT TO YOU HERE TODAY IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO LAY THAT OUT WEEK BY WEEK BETWEEN NOW AND THE ELECTIONS TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. NOT TO LAY OUT A BUMPER STICKER, NOT TO LAY OUT A TALKING POINT, BUT LITERALLY TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO ON ALL OF THE MAJOR ISSUES AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO START ON DAY ONE. PEOPLE ARE CYNICAL AND UNDERSTANDABLY SO. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT ANGER, IT IS ABOUT URGENCY. ANGER IS A NEGATIVE THING. IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO CHECK OUT. WHAT I SENSE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY. WE NEED LEADERS WHO WILL TELL US WHAT THEY WILL DO AND HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THEY WILL ACTUALLY DO THAT. THAT IS WHAT I DID AS GOVERNOR. THAT IS WHAT I DID AS COUNTY EXECUTIVE. WHEN I LAID OUT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE FIRST DAYS I WAS IN OFFICE. I LAID IT OUT IN A CAR AND TOLD PEOPLE TO -- CARD AND TOLD PEOPLE TO HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE. I STILL RUN INTO DEMOCRATS WHO TELL ME I STILL HAVE YOUR CARD ON MY REFRIGERATOR. BECAUSE I CANNOT BELIEVE SOMEBODY DARED ME TO CHECK TO SEE IF I WOULD DARE AND YOU DID EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS AND FOR THAT I WILL HOPE FOR YOU GOING FORWARD. I THINK THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY FOR. PEOPLE WHO DO NOT JUST SAY THINGS BUT SAY THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO AND HOW I AM GOING TO DO IT. WE NEED LEADERS WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE A PLAN TO MOVE THE COUNTRY FORWARD. TO WREACK HAVOC ON WASHINGTON WE NEED A LEADER WHO HAS BEEN TESTED. WE HAVE SEEN THE MISTAKES THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU PUT SOMEBODY IN PRESIDENT WAS NEVER BEEN IN CHARGE BEFORE. YOU CAN MAKE ALL OF THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER SOUNDS GREAT. BUT IF YOU CANNOT DELIVER ON THOSE PROMISES, TALK IS CHEAP. THAT DOES NOT GET US MOVING FORWARD. IF WE WANT TO WRECK HAVOC ON WASHINGTON WE NEED A LEADER THAT HAS BEEN TESTED AND I HAVE BEEN TESTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER LEADER IN THIS RACE. WHAT IS THE OLD ADAGE? WHAT DOES NOT KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER. IT RETURNS IF I WONDERED IF THAT WAS JUST FIGURATIVE, THE WAY THINGS -- THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WONDERED IF IT WAS JUST FIGURATIVE, THE WAY THINGS WERE GOING. I HAVE PASSED THE TEST TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I AM READY TO LEAVE THIS EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY FILLED WITH EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE GOING FORWARD. -- LEAD THE SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY FILLED WITH EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE GOING FORWARD. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: HERE ON THIS GREAT STAGE, THIS STAGE WERE RONALD REAGAN FOUND HIS VOICE, NOT JUST AS A STUDENT AT YOUR READER, BUT FOR THE NATION AND -- AT YOUR REJECT, BEFORE THE NATION -- EUREKA, BUT FOR THIS NATION AND FOR THIS WORLD. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. WE HAVE TWO SONS, MATTHEW WHO IS A SENIOR AT COLLEGE AND ALEX WHO WAS A JUNIOR. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS. THE REASON WE RAN FOR GOVERNOR IS BECAUSE OF OUR SONS. WE SAW A STATE THAT WAS NOT FITTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE FELT WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THE REASON I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS IN THE SAME VEIN. FOR ME, IT IS ABOUT MATT AND ALEX AND ALL OF YOU HERE, THE YOUNGER ONES AS WELL. THOSE YET TO BE BORN. BECAUSE REALLY THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT ABOUT A BUSINESS OR A HOME OR ANYTHING ELSE OF MATERIAL VALUE. THE AMERICAN DREAM, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND SOMEDAY YOUR GRANDCHILDREN HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN THE ONE YOU INHERITED FROM YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR GRANDPARENTS. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. THAT IS WHY WE TOOK ON ALL THE PRESSURE. THAT IS WHY, BUT IS THE REASON I RAN FOR GOVERNOR BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD 100,000 PROTESTERS, WHEN WE HAD DEATH THREATS, WHEN MY KIDS WERE THREATENED ON FACEBOOK, WHEN AWFUL THINGS WERE SAID ABOUT MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER-IN-LAW AND MY FAMILY, AND THEN ABOUT A TITLE, I WOULD HAVE SAID, THAT IS ENOUGH. I DO NOT NEED THIS JOB. I DO NOT NEED THIS TITLE. INSTEAD IT WAS A GREAT REMINDER FOR ME THAT THE REASON I GOT INTO THIS WAS NOT FOR A POSITION, IT WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT MY CHILDREN AND OTHERS LIKE THEM HAD A BETTER FUTURE. AND I WAS ABLE TO THESE CHALLENGES, AND THEY ARE BIG, DO NOT GET ME WRONG, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE DEBT AND THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT WE HAVE YET TO SEE, YOU LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES OF ISIS AND IRAN AND PLACES AROUND THE WORLD, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. BUT JUST LIKE REAGAN, I AM AN OPTIMIST. I BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN NO CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IS TOO BIG FOR THE RESOLVE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I BELIEVE IF WE HAVE LEADERS THAT THINK MORE ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE NEXT ELECTION, THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER. NOW MORE THAN EVER, WE NEED A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN. A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR REFORM IN WASHINGTON. A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR TRUE ECONOMIC GROWTH, NOT JUST FOR NOW BEFORE THE FUTURE AND FUTURE GENERATIONS -- BUT FOR THE FUTURE AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN ARE SAFE FROM ISIS AND THE THREATS IN THE WORLD. IF YOU ELECT ME AS YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT, I WILL TELL YOU THIS. I WILL NOT BACK DOWN. I WON'T BACK DOWN. I HAVEN'T TESTED, NOT JUST FOR OTHERS, BUT FOR MYSELF. I KNOW I WILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO FACE TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. I WILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM THESE CHALLENGES. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEEDED SOMEBODY WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR YOU. SOMEBODY WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR YOUR FAMILY. SOMEONE WHO WILL FIGHT AND WIN FOR AMERICA. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?328220-1/senator-bernie-sanders-ivt-town-hall-meeting-new-hampshire,Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) Town Hall Meeting in New Hampshire,Bernie Sanders,"LIVE ON TV OR ONLINE AT WWW.C-SPAN.ORG. [CHEERING] >> FOCUSING ON JOBS, NATIONAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR SANDERS: THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. FOR COMING OUT ON A BEAUTIFUL SUNDAY MORNING TO DO SOMETHING VERY, VERY RADICAL. ARE YOU READY FOR RADICAL ACTIVITY? AUDIENCE: YEAH! SENATOR SANDERS: WE ARE GOING TO PRACTICE DEMOCRACY. HOW'S THAT? [CHEERING] SENATOR SANDERS: LET ME BEGIN BY TAKING OFF MY JACKET. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] SENATOR SANDERS: LET ME THANK MELANIE FOR HER KIND INTRODUCTION. LET ME THANK SEAN, WHO IS WITH THE SHEET METAL WORKERS UNION. WHAT SHAWN UNDERSTANDS AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS WE DO NOT GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS OF THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT A STRONG TRADE UNION MOVEMENT AND I AM PLEDGED TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME THANK JEFF. JEFF IS ONE OF THE MILLIONS OF UNSUNG HEROES WHO EVERY DAY GOES TO WORK AS A TEACHER. AND I KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND THE GREAT BASKETBALL AND BASEBALL PLAYERS OF THIS COUNTRY, WE PAY THEM HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DO NOT PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION AND WE DO NOT THINK PEOPLE LIKE JEFF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO. -- WE DO NOT THANK PEOPLE LIKE JEFF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO. [APPLAUSE] WE ANNOUNCED OUR CANDIDACY FOR A HALF MONTHS AGO. AND WHEN I ANNOUNCED IT -- FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS AGO. AND WENT I ANNOUNCED IT, PEOPLE WERE VERY POLITE, BUT NO ONE THOUGHT WE HAD A CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING. A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS. AND I THINK THE REASON IS THE ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OUR ISSUES THAT ARE RESONATING WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, HAVING GONE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND HAVING TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE, I HEAR MANY REMARKS. PEOPLE ARE VERY GENEROUS. ONE REMARK THAT STANDS IN MY MIND, A YOUNG MAN IN THE WEST COAST. HE CAME UP TO ME. HE SAID, BARNEY, THANK YOU. YOU ARE TREATING US LIKE WE ARE INTELLIGENT -- BERNIE, THANK YOU. YOU ARE TREATING US LIKE WE ARE INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEINGS. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WHAT A LOT OF POLITICS PASSES FOR IN THIS DAY AND AGE, AND ENCOURAGED BY THE MEDIA UNFORTUNATELY, IS A GAME OF POLLING PEOPLE, NAMES, AND ATTACKING PEOPLE EVERY DAY. IF I TRIP LEAVING THE STAGE IT WILL BE A FRONT-PAGE STORY. THE PICTURE OF ME BEING FACEDOWN ON THE GROUND, OR IF I WERE TO START VICIOUSLY ATTACKING HILLARY CLINTON, IT WOULD BE ON THE FRONT PAGES. BUT I DON'T DO THAT. I DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK AS A NATION WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK IN FRONT OF US IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY. AND WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT IS LAYING THOSE ISSUES ON THE TABLE, UNDERSTANDING THAT HONEST PEOPLE CAN DIFFER WITH US, HAVE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW, BUT DEBATING THOSE ISSUES AND SEEING HOW WE GO FORWARD IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THEM. IT AIN'T MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT, AND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IN THIS CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] SO, THE CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT HOW I AM STANDING IN THE POLLS, ALTHOUGH, THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE ARE DOING PRETTY WELL HERE. [CHEERING] BUT POLLS GO UP AND PULLS GO DOWN. THE REAL ISSUE, IS HOW WE TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER, AND HOW WE TRANSFORM AMERICA IN THE DIRECTION WE THINK IT NEEDS TO GO. [APPLAUSE] SO, LET ME JUST START OFF BY TELLING YOU SOMETHING I AM CONFIDENT NO OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WILL TELL YOU. AND THIS IS SOMETIMES HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GRASP OR TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT, BUT IT IS THE SIMPLE TRUTH. IF BERNIE SANDERS -- IT DOESN'T MATTER IN A CERTAIN SENSE WHO IS ELECTED PRESIDENT UNLESS THERE IS A POLITICAL REVOLUTION IN THIS COUNTRY OF MANY, MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TOGETHER, STANDING UP AND SAYING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY, I ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. [APPLAUSE] AND I'M BEGINNING TO HEAR THAT ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE SAY, WAIT A SECOND. YOU KNOW, THIS COUNTRY BELONGS TO ALL OF US AND NOT JUST TO A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES WHO CAN MAKE HUGE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS . NOW THE POINT THAT I MAKE IS THAT NO PRESIDENT -- NOT BERNIE SANDERS OR ANYBODY ELSE -- CAN DO IT ALONE, IS BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS. WALL STREET, CORPORATE AMERICA, THE KOCH BROTHERS, HUGE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTORS HAVE ENORMOUS POWER. AND IF YOU THINK THAT ANY PRESIDENT -- YOU SENT ME TO THE OVAL OFFICE, I COULD SAY TO WALL STREET, WELL, GUYS, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU START PAYING A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATION SO ARE THEIR KIDS 11 OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION FREE, AND THEY WILL SAY, HEY, BERNIE, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA! WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF THAT? YOU GOT IT, MAN! WE WILL SPEND MILLIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATION. AND WHEN I GO TO CORPORATE AMERICA AND I SAY, HEY, MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA NOT TO CONTINUE TO SHUT DOWN MANUFACTURING PLANTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT AND SEND OUR JOBS TO LOW-WAGE COUNTRIES ABROAD, THEY SAY, LISTEN, WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF THAT, BERNIE? FANTASTIC IDEA. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE WILL DO TOMORROW. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT. IT DOES NOT HAPPEN LIKE THAT. EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THE ONLY WAY REAL CHANGE TAKES PLACE IS WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT BACK. [APPLAUSE] NOW THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TODAY IT DIDN'T JUST OCCUR -- IT OCCURRED BECAUSE SOME THOUGHT AND DIED IN THE STRUGGLE TO SAY WE WILL END RACISM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS HOW IT HAPPENED. [APPLAUSE] OBVIOUSLY -- OBVIOUSLY, WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IN COMBATING RACISM, BUT THAT'S HOW PROGRESS IS MADE. WE HAVE MADE IN NORMA'S STEPS FORWARD IN TERMS OF FIGHTING SEXISM IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WOMEN FROM OVER 100 YEARS HAVE STOOD UP WITH THEIR MALE ALLIES AND SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO JUDGE PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR GENDER. WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO BREAK DOWN SEXISM IN AMERICA AND GIVE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE IN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. IT DID NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD SENATORS. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED -- AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT 40 OR 50 OR 100 YEARS AGO -- IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF GAY RIGHTS IN AMERICA, IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE GAY COMMUNITY STOOD UP. THEY GOT ARRESTED. THEY GOT BEATEN. AND THEY WORKED WITH THEIR STRAIGHT ALLEYS AND THEY SAID, HEY, IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WE ARE GOING TO BE JUDGED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ON OUR CHARACTER AND NOT OUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. [APPLAUSE] SO, MY POINT IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORY IN GENERAL, AMERICAN HISTORY, WORLD HISTORY, THAT IS HOW CHANGE TAKES PLACE. SO, WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT KIND OF UNIQUELY -- YES, OF COURSE I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. YES, I AM HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO HELP ME WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION AND IM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO HELP MAKE ME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT ALSO WHAT I AM ASKING YOU IS TO BE WITH ME, NOT JUST FOR THE ELECTION. YOU'VE GOT TO BE WITH ME THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS BECAUSE NO PRESIDENT CAN DO IT ALONE. THE POWERS THAT BE ARE JUST TOO POWERFUL. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK, WE WIN. BECAUSE WHILE THEY MAY HAVE THE MONEY, THEY MAY HAVE THE POWER, WE HAVE THE PEOPLE. AND WHEN PEOPLE STAND TOGETHER, WE WIN. [APPLAUSE] NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TAKE A FEW MINUTES -- WELL, ACTUALLY LONGER THAN A FEW MINUTES -- TO GO OVER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT, TO MY MIND, ARE THE ISSUES ON THE MINDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEN WE WILL STOP. WE WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR COMMENTS. TO MY MIND, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE LIVE IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY. MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. WHY DON'T THEY KNOW THAT? THEY ARE TOO BUSY WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. THEY ARE TOO BUSY BEING ONE OF THE 45 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY TO REALLY KNOW THAT. THEY DO NOT KNOW IT BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THE NEW INCOME AND WEALTH IS GOING TO THE TOP 1%. NOW INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY HAS GOT TO BE BROUGHT OUT INTO THE OPEN AND WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE SIMPLE TRUTH. THE UNITED STATES HAS MORE INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION ON EARTH AND AT ANY TIME SINCE 1928. IN AMERICA TODAY, THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. 1/10 OF 1% OWNS ALMOST AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. IN AMERICA TODAY, 58% OF ALL NEW INCOME AND CREATED -- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WORKING CRAZY HOURS, LONG JOBS, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, 58% OF ALL NEW INCOME CREATED IS GOING TO THE TOP 1%. IN AMERICA TODAY, YOU GOT ONE FAMILY. THE WALTON FAMILY OF WALMART, OWNING MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 49% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN MY VIEW, THAT IS A RIGGED ECONOMY, NOT AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. IT HAS GOT TO CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] AND THIS CAMPAIGN IS SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS. IT'S A SIMPLE MESSAGE. IT IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD MESSAGE, AND THAT IS YOU CANNOT HAVE IT ALL. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET HUGE TAX BREAKS WHEN CHILDREN IN AMERICA ARE GOING HUNGRY. YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO SEND OUR JOBS TO CHINA AND OTHER LOW-WAGE COUNTRIES WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DESPERATELY NEED DECENT PAYING JOBS. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO GIVE THE CEO'S OF LARGE CORPORATIONS HUGE COMPENSATION PACKAGES AT THE SAME TIME YOU CUT THE WAGES AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND THE PENSIONS OF YOUR EMPLOYEES. YOUR GREED IS GOING TO END, AND WE ARE GOING TO END IT FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] BUT IT IS NOT ONLY THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS. WE HAVE TO PUT THESE ISSUES ON THE TABLE BECAUSE IF WE ARE NOT DISCUSSING THEM, WE ARE NOT GOING TO RESOLVE THEM. I THINK EVERYONE WHO IS FAIR-MINDED UNDERSTANDS THE ECONOMY TODAY IS FAR, FAR BETTER THAN IT WAS WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEFT OFFICE. ALL RIGHT? THAT IS A FACT. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I SAW THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE, PAINFULLY, FOR THREE HOURS. AND IT WAS REALLY QUITE AMAZING TO ME THE KIND OF AMNESIA OF THESE GUIDES HAVE. EVERY PROBLEM IN THE WORLD -- IT'S TOO HOT, IT'S TOO COLD, IT'S RAINING, IT'S NOT RAINING -- IT'S ALL BARACK OBAMA'S FAULT . IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I NEVER KNEW THAT ONE PERSON HAD SO MUCH POWER TO CREATE SO MANY PROBLEMS. THEY SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS. MAYBE THEY SUFFER SHORT-TERM AMNESIA. THEY SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WHEN OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE WE WERE LOSING 800 THOUSAND JOBS A MONTH. 800,000 JOBS. AND THESE GUYS ARE LIKE, WELL, WE ARE GROWING 175,000 JOBS A MONTH -- NOT ENOUGH. YES, TRUE, NOT ENOUGH. BUT IT IS A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. [APPLAUSE] THESE GUYS WORRY ABOUT THE DEFICIT. SERIOUS ISSUE. THAT THEY FORGOT TO TELL US -- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY -- THAT WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE WE HAVE THE LARGEST DEFICIT IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY, 1.4 TRILLION DOLLARS. MUCH LOWER TODAY THAN IT WAS THEN. FORGOT TO TELL US WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE, AFTER ALL OF THE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, AFTER ALL OF THE DEREGULATION, THE AMERICAN AND WORLD FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. AND ECONOMISTS WERE WORRIED YOU WOULD STICK YOUR CREDIT CARD INTO AN ATM MACHINE AND NOTHING WOULD COME OUT. THAT IS THE ECONOMY OBAMA INHERITED, AND WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT. [APPLAUSE] BUT LET'S ALSO BE HONEST. AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS -- 4-0, 40 YEARS, UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN THE WORLD OF TODAY. MANY OF US WHO ARE OLDER DO SEE THE LONG PICTURE. WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS THAT MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IS ALMOST $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS IN 1999. WE KNOW THAT MALE WORKERS IS MAKING SOME $700 LESS IN INFLATION-ADJUSTED INCOME THAN HE WAS 42 YEARS AGO. WOMEN ARE MAKING $1300 LESS TODAY THAN THEY MADE IN 2007. HOW DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE AN EXPLOSION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT DESPITE ALL OF THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. AND MY ANSWER IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ECONOMY NOT TO MAKE THE RICH RICHER ABOUT TO EXPAND THE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] STARTED OFF WITH A JACKET. GOT RID OF THAT. THIS LEAVES ARE GOING UP. I WILL PROBABLY TAKE MY SHIRT OFF IN A FEW MINUTES AND IT WILL BE QUITE A SHOW. I WOULDN'T DO THAT. I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS THE OTHER GUYS HERE. [LAUGHTER] LET ME TALK ABOUT ANOTHER ISSUE THAT DOES NOT GET THE FULL DISCUSSION IT DESERVES WHICH IS THE ISSUE OF UNEMPLOYMENT. EVERY MONTH THE GOVERNMENT COMES OUT WITH A BUNCH OF STATISTICS ON UNEMPLOYMENT. THAN ONE -- THE ONE YOU MOSTLY SEE IS OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH IS ABOUT 5.1%. WHO KNOWS WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? WHERE IS THAT AN ADEQUATE ANY GUESSES? GOOD. IT DOES NOT COUNT PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP WORK, LOOKING FOR WORK, AND IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING PART TIME WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THAT CATEGORY. WHAT IS CALLED REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA IS OVER 10%. THE SECOND POINT WHICH WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT AT ALL, AND I'M TRYING TO PUSH DISCUSSION ON IT AND I'M NOT GETTING MUCH HELP FROM THE MEDIA HERE. THAT IS USE UNEMPLOYMENT. ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO, I ASKED THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE TO DO A STUDY FOR ME. IT'S A KID GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL -- NOT A DROPOUT -- BETWEEN THE AGES OF 17 AND 20, IF THAT KID IS WHITE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 33%, HISPANIC 36 SEND, AFRICAN-AMERICAN 51% -- HISPANIC 36%. FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TURNED OUR BACK ON KIDS WHO WANT TO STAND UP ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET, GET OUT, GET A JOB, BECOME ADULTS. WE ARE SAYING, SORRY, THERE ARE NO JOBS FOR MANY OF YOU. THAT WE SEGUE TO ANOTHER ISSUE OF A NORMA'S CONSEQUENCE THAT WE ALSO DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT. I HOPE EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THEY ON ANY OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH. DID YOU ALL KNOW THAT? CHINA, AN AUTHORITARIAN COMMUNIST COUNTRY -- THEY ARE NOT ALL THAT LIBERAL, YOU KNOW. THEY ARE THREE TIMES OUR SIZE. WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN CHINA. WHAT IS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN HIGH YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCARCERATION? WE HAVE KIDS HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, VERMONT, HANGING OUT ON STREET CORNERS GETTING THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE, DOING DRUGS, ETC. SO IN MY VIEW IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE FOR THIS COUNTRY TO BE INVESTING IN EDUCATION, IN JOBS, RATHER THAN IN JAILS AND INCARCERATION. [APPLAUSE] JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT. WE'RE SPENDING ABOUT $80 BILLION A YEAR KEEPING PEOPLE BEHIND BARS. IT VARIES MAY BE ABOUT 60,000 DOLLARS TO KEEP SOMEONE IN JAIL FOR A YEAR. THINK OF THE MONEY WE COULD USE TO WORK WITH THEM. YOU WILL NOT DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE HANGING OUT ON STREET CORNERS. WE WILL BE SAVING TAXPAYERS MONEY. IT'S THE RATIONAL APPROACH. THAT'S THE THINKING WE HAVE TO GO FORWARD WITH. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE ASK OURSELVES -- HOW DOES IT HAPPEN? YOU HAVE PEOPLE WORKING TO, THREE JOBS TRYING TO COBBLE TOGETHER ENOUGH INCOME AND HEALTH CARE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY. HOW IS THAT? THE ANSWER IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS. ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING FOR WAGES THAT ARE JUST TOO DOWNLOAD. THAT'S THE FACT. -- TOO DAMN LOW. THAT'S THE FACT. [APPLAUSE] GET OUT YOUR CALCULATOR AND START MULTIPLYING THE MINIMUM WAGE. 40 TIMES $7.25 TIMES 52 WEEKS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF A FAMILY LET ALONE ONE PERSON. THE MINIMUM WAGE TODAY IS A STARVATION WAGE. IT HAS TO BE RAISED TO A LIVING WAGE, $15 PER HOUR, OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA TO SAY THAT IF SOMEONE WORKS 40 HOURS PER WEEK IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE LIVING IN POVERTY. THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE TIED TO RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT IS THAT I SINCERELY HOPE THAT EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM WILL STAND WITH THE WOMEN AND FIGHT FOR PAY EQUITY WITH WOMEN WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS NO RATIONAL, ECONOMIC REASON. IT IS JUST BASED ON A HISTORY OF SEXISM THAT WOMEN TODAY ARE MAKING $.78 ON THE ONE DOLLAR COMPARED TO MEN. WHEN WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND WHEN WE HAVE PAY A QUITTING, WHAT WE WILL ALSO DO IS GIVE SOME HOPE -- WHEN WE HAVE PAY EQUITY, WE WILL GIVE SOME HOPE TO SINGLE MOMS WERE STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO RAISE THEIR KIDS WITH DIGNITY. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WHEN YOU SEE SINGLE MOMS RAISING KIDS AND YOU SEE HOW HARD THEY WORK, IT'S QUITE AMAZING TO ME. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU HAVE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, AND A LOT OF POLITICIANS AND SOME OF THEM ARE REPUBLICANS. YOU HAVE HEARD, NO DOUBT, TIME AFTER TIME REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES CONCERNS ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. RIGHT? FAMILY VALUES. THEY STAY UP NIGHTS WORRYING ABOUT FAMILY. ALL OF YOU KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN BY FAMILY VALUES AND WHAT THEY MEAN IS THAT WOMEN IN AMERICA SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES -- I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] AND WHAT THEY ALSO MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES IS THAT OUR GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET MARRIED -- I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE FOUR GREAT KIDS. AND ONE OF THEM IS HERE RIGHT NOW. I HAVE SEVEN BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILDREN. JANE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 27 YEARS. AND WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN FAMILY VALUES AND STRENGTHENING VALUES. OUR VIEWS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE REPUBLICANS. I START OFF WHEN I TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES DEMANDING THAT WE END INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT OF BEING THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY -- THE ONLY ONE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? TODAY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT, ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WOMEN ARE GIVING BIRTH. YOU KNOW WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT IN YOUR LIVES THAT IS -- UNFORGETTABLE. IT'S ALSO A PRETTY BIG DAY FOR THE BABY. [LAUGHTER] BUT -- AND HERE'S THE BUT --IF THAT MOM AND HER FAMILY HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES, SHE WILL STAY HOME AND DO WHAT A MOM WANTS TO DO WHICH IS TO SPEND TIME WITH HER BABIES, GETTING TO KNOW HER BABY, LOVE HER BABY, ON HER BABY. DAD WILL BE THERE, TOO AND WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME OF A HUMAN BEING'S LIFE. BUT IF THAT MOM DOES NOT HAVE THE MONEY. IF SHE IS LOW INCOME OR WORKING-CLASS, WHAT SHE IS FORCED TO DO AFTER ONE WEEK OR TWO WEEKS IS PUT THAT BABY ASIDE AND GO BACK TO WORK IN ORDER TO EARN ENOUGH INCOME TO TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILY. FORCING WOMEN TO SEPARATE FROM THEIR NEWBORN BABIES IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS, IN FACT, THE OPPOSITE OF A FAMILY VALUE AND THAT IS WHY I WILL FIGHT FOR UNITED STATES JOINING COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD IN GUARANTEEING AT LEAST 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU GET A CALL IN THE POLLSTER SAYS WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANTLY ON YOUR MIND? USUALLY THE ANSWER WITH A FOUR LETTER WORD -- J-O-B-S. THEY KNOW IF YOU ARE IN A WORKER YOU COULD BE REPLACED TOMORROW BY A YOUNGER WORKER FOR HALF THE WAGES. THEY KNOW IF YOU ARE A COLLEGE GRADUATE IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND A JOB ANSWER IT WITH YOUR EDUCATION. -- COMMISERATE WITH YOUR EDUCATION. THEY KNOW IF YOU ARE A DROPOUT IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND ANY WORK AT ANY WAGE. WHEN YOU HAVE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY OF 10%, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT OFF THE CHARTS, WHAT I THINK IS WE NEED A MASSIVE FEDERAL JOBS PROGRAM TO PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD NOT BE FIRING TEACHERS. WE SHOULD BE HIRING MORE TEACHERS. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD NOT BE FIRING CHILDCARE WORKERS, FIREMEN, OR POLICE OFFICERS. WE SHOULD BE HIRING MORE OF THEM BECAUSE WE NEED THEM. AND PERHAPS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN AMERICA, ROADS, BRIDGES, RAIL, AIRPORTS, WATER PLANTS, WASTEWATER PLANTS THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE CRUMBLING. THEY NEED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK. WHEN YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED WORK AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S CRUMBLING, COMMON SENSE SAYS WE INVEST IN REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS DOING THAT. [APPLAUSE] LET ME ALSO SAY A WORD ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT SO SEXY BUT IS AN OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT. NOT ONLY SHOULD WE BE CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW, DECENT PAYING JOBS, WE HAVE GOT TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF MILLIONS OF JOBS AS A RESULT OF OUR DISASTROUS TRADE POLICIES. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SENATOR AND FORMER CONGRESSMAN WHO HAS VOTED AGAINST NAFTA, PERMANENT TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND WILL HELP LEAD THE OPPOSITION TO THIS DISASTROUS TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. [APPLAUSE] ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE ECONOMY AND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW HOW WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, HOW WE LOWER PROPERTY RATES, HOW WE PUT PEOPLE TO WORK WITH DECENT PAYING JOBS HAS GOT TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WALL STREET. WALL STREET, AS ALL OF YOU KNOW, THROUGH THEIR GREED, THEIR RECKLESSNESS, THEIR ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR, JEROME THIS COUNTRY INTO THE WORST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL FEELING THE IMPACT OF WHAT WALL STREET DID. HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING. THE CONGRESS, AGAINST I VOTE, VOTED TO AOL WALL STREET BECAUSE THEY WERE ""TOO BIG TO FAIL."" IF THEY WENT DOWN, HALF THE ECONOMY WOULD GO WITH THEM. TODAY THREE OUT OF FOUR OF THE LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA TODAY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THEY WERE WHEN WE BUILD THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BIG TO FAIL. YOU HAVE THE SIX LARGEST BANKS IN THIS COUNTRY ISSUING MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF ALL CREDIT CARD AND OVER 35% OF ALL MORTGAGES. THAT TYPE OF CONCENTRATION IN WEALTH AND POWER IS NOT A POSITIVE THING FOR OUR ECONOMY. IF TEDDY ROOSEVELT, THE OLD TRUST BUSTER, WAS ALIVE TODAY, HE WOULD SAY BREAK THEM UP. I AGREE WITH TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO. [APPLAUSE] THE LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS TOO BIG TO FAIL THEN IT'S TOO BIG TO EXIST -- END OF DISCUSSION. [APPLAUSE] NOW, I AM OFTEN ASKED. ERNIE, YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT ISSUES. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OUT THERE AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DELINEATE JUST ONE ISSUE, BUT I WILL TELL YOU ONE ISSUE THAT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT IMPACTS EVERY OTHER ISSUE THAT WE FACE AS A NATION, SO LET ME BE AS BLUNT AS I CAN BE IN TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK MOST OF YOU ALREADY KNOW. AS A RESULT OF THE DISASTROUS SUPREME COURT DECISION IN THE CITIZENS UNITED CASE, THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM -- AND I USE THESE WORDS ADVISEDLY, HAS BEEN TOTALLY CORRUPTED AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY ARE BEING UNDERMINED. [APPLAUSE] I WISH I COULD SUGARCOATED. AND NOT BE AS BLUNT AS I AM ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BUT IT'S JUST THE SIMPLE TRUTH. HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MY STATE OF VERMONT, SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR STATES WE HAVE HAD TOWN MEETINGS AND ROOMS LIKE THIS. PEOPLE COME TOGETHER AND THEY ARGUE ABOUT THE SCHOOL BUDGET, THE ROADS, AND THEN THEY VOTE. ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE. THAT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY WHERE I COME FROM. WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A RESULT OF THIS SUPREME COURT DECISION WHERE THEY SAID TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, OK. YOU ALREADY OWN MUCH OF THE ECONOMY OF AMERICA SO NOW WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO OWN AND BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS A SUPER PAC AND THE REASON THEY HAVE SUPER PAC'S IS THAT MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES CAN SPEND UNLIMITED SUMS OF MONEY ON THOSE CAMPAIGNS. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, YOU HAVE THE KOCH BROTHERS, THE SECOND WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN AMERICA, A FAMILY THAT WANTS TO AND A SOCIAL SECURITY, AND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY SPENDING IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE ALONE SOME $900 MILLION. THAT IS MORE MONEY THAN EITHER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL SPEND. WHEN YOU HAVE ONE FAMILY SPENDING MORE THAN EITHER OF THE TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, MY FRIENDS, YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT DEMOCRACY. YOU ARE LOOKING AT AN OLIGARCHY AND THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE NOT MADE MANY CAMPAIGN PROMISES SO FAR. THERE IS ONE I WANT TO REPEAT TO YOU AND THAT IS NO NOMINEE OF MINE FOR THE UNITED STATES PRINT COURT WILL GET THAT POSITION UNLESS HE OR SHE IS HOT AND CLEAR IN SAYING THAT THEY WILL OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. -- UNLESS HE OR SHE IS LOUD AND CLEAR IN SAYING THAT THEY WILL OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED AREA. [APPLAUSE] NOW, WE ARE IN A SCHOOL HERE IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I KNOW THAT EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT EDUCATION. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE LIVE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. WE ALL KNOW -- IT DOES NOT TAKE ROCKET SCIENTIST TO FIGURE IT OUT -- THAT IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD BUT IT WILL BE VERY HARD OR OUR ECONOMY TO GROW, BE STRONG, CREATE THE KINDS OF JOBS WE WANT FOR OUR KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN. IT IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION HOW WE HAVE A SITUATION TODAY WHERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT, QUALIFIED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO COLLEGE, WHO HAVE THE DESIRE TO GO TO COLLEGE, CANNOT GO TO COLLEGE FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON -- THEIR FAMILY LACKS THE MONEY. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE IT IN THE MIDDLE CLASS BECOME ENGINEERS, SCIENTISTS, DOCTORS, TEACHERS. I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA IS TUITION FREE. [APPLAUSE] IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE COUNTRIES WE'RE COMPETING WITH AROUND THE WORLD ARE ALREADY DOING IT OR JUST BECAUSE IT OR 60 YEARS AGO IN AMERICA IT EXISTED BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT FOR THE KIDS IN THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN SEABROOK, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH A KID HERE IN THE FOURTH GRADE IN SEABROOK OR MY HOMETOWN OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT? I WILL TELL YOU. I GREW UP IN A FAMILY WHERE MY MOM AND DAD NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE. ALL OVER AMERICA YOU HAVE KIDS WITH LOW INCOME WORKING CLASS KIDS AND THEY DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO DID GO TO COLLEGE. THE IDEA SITTING HERE IN THE FIFTH GRADE THAT THEY MIGHT SOMEDAY GO TO COLLEGE IS ABOUT AS DISTANT AS THE IDEA THAT THEY MAY GO TO THE MOON. WHAT OUR JOB IS TODAY IS TO SAY EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WITH HER YOU ARE IN FOURTH, EIGHTH, SIXTH GRADE IF YOU STUDY HARD, IF YOU TAKE SCHOOL SERIOUSLY, IF YOU DO WELL IN SCHOOL -- YES, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE REGARDLESS OF THE INCOME OF YOUR FAMILIES. [APPLAUSE] IT WILL CHANGE THE ATTITUDE OF MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO WILL NOW KNOW IF THEY STUDY HARD THEY WILL HAVE A GOOD FUTURE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION, THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS AND IT'S THE ABSURDITY OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOUNG AND NOT SO YOUNG, WHO ARE STRUGGLING UNDER HORRENDOUS LEVELS OF STUDENT DEBT. IN MY MIND IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR PEOPLE TO BE CARRYING INTEREST RATES ON THEIR STUDENT DATE OF 6%, 8%, 10% WHEN THEY CAN REFINANCE THEIR HOMES AT 2%, THREE PERCENT, 4% AND OUR LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] I TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING 20% OF THEIR INCOME IN STUDENT DEBT WHO CANNOT BUY A CAR, BUY HOME, SOMETIMES CANNOT GET MARRIED OR HAVE KIDS. THAT'S A CRAZY. WE NEED TO LEAVE OUR PLANET HABITABLE AND HEALTHY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] I SPEAK TO YOU AS A MEMBER OF A MEMBER OF THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE BY SAYING THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY HAS DECIDED VERY CLEARLY THAT THE DEBATE IS OVER. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY. CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY -- LOOK AT THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA, THE HEAT WAVE IN PAKISTAN -- CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY CAUSING DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. IF WE DO NOT GET OUR ACT TOGETHER THE SITUATION WILL BECOME MUCH WORSE IN YEARS TO COME. THE SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING IF WE CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL, BY THE END OF THE CENTURY, IMAGINE THIS, THE PLANET EARTH WILL BE 5-10 DEGREES WARMER THAN IT IS TODAY. MORE DROUGHT, MORE FLOODS, MORE EXTREME WEATHER DISTURBANCES MORE RISING SEA LEVELS, MORE INTERNATIONAL WAR AND CONFLICT AS PEOPLE FIGHT FOR INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES TO GROW THEIR CROPS. IN MY VIEW, WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAVE THE WORLD, WORK WITH CHINA, RUSSIA, INDIA, ALL OVER THIS GLOBE TO MOVE TOWARDS ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE AND -- SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE THEMES OF MY CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN TO THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO THINK BIG, NOT SMALL. TO NOT GET IN THE MINDSET IN WHICH WE DEBATE WHETHER WE CUT EDUCATION BY 2% OR 4%, TO GET NOT INTO THE MINDSET OF WHETHER WE DO THIS LITTLE THING WERE THAT LITTLE THING, TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD IF WE STAND TOGETHER THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH. LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TODAY IS THE ONLY MAJOR WEALTHY COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. WE ARE THE ONLY ONES. [APPLAUSE] NOW, I VOTED FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. WE'VE JUST AND DOWN THE NUMBERS OF UNINSURED. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE STILL HAVE 30 MILLION AMERICANS WITHOUT ANY HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANY OF YOU WHO MAY HAVE INSURANCE HAVE HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND HIGH COPAYMENTS. YET AT THE END OF ALL OF THAT, AS A NATION, WE AND UP SPENDING FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE. IN MY VIEW, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL OF OUR PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. WE CAN DO IT IN A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY BY MOVING TOWARD A MEDICARE FOR ALL SINGLE-PAYER PROGRAM. [APPLAUSE] IF EVERY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH CAN DO WITH, WE CAN DO IT AS WELL. WE CAN SPEND LESS PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE THAN WE CURRENTLY DO. I'M THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. I WANT TO TAKE THE SECOND THE TALK ABOUT VALUES WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET WHICH THEN GOES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW, BUT MOST OF YOU DO NOT, THE NATURE OF THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET THAT PASSED THE CONGRESS. AT A TIME WHEN 30 MILLION AMERICANS STILL HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE THEY VOTED TO AND OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, MAKE MASSIVE CUTS IN MEDICAID, THROAT 27 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY HAVE NO RESPONSE. NOT ONE OF THEM. YOU WILL NOTICE IN THE RECENT DEBATE NOBODY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 30 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE. MILLIONS MORE ARE UNDERINSURED. IT'S NOT THEIR CONCERN. AND THEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET AT A TIME WHEN MILLIONS OF WORKING CLASS FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY WILL SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE, REPUBLICAN BUDGET OVER 10 YEARS CUTTING HEALTH GRANTS BY $90 BILLION. AND THEN, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE REALITY THAT MILLIONS OF FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE THE BREADWINNER IS MAKING $10 AN HOUR CANNOT AFFORD TO FEED THEIR FAMILY ADEQUATELY, REPUBLICAN BUDGET CUT NUTRITION PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR BABIES BY MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THEN TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, TO TELL YOU REALLY WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AFTER CUTTING HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, NUTRITION THEY PROVIDED OVER $250 BILLION IN TAX BREAKS TO THE TOP 0.2%. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THOSE ARE NOT THE PRIORITIES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE MANY REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, COMING BEFORE US TELLING US WE HAVE TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, LET ME TELL YOU THAT I WILL NOT CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF SENIORS TRYING TO SURVIVE ON $13,000 PER YEAR. IN FACT, WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS LIFT THE CAP ON TAXABLE INCOME AND EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS -- NOT CUT THEM. [APPLAUSE] AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, AS A NATION, I BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ENDING RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE STILL HAVE A VERY, VERY LONG WAY TO GO. WHEN I TALK ABOUT RACISM, I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A VERY SICK PERSON WHO WALKS INTO A CHARLESTON, S.C., PRAYER SESSION WHO PRAYS WITH PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AND TAKES OUT A GUN TO KILL LINE OF THEM BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN IS DIFFERENT THAN HIS. I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF GROUPS IN THIS COUNTRY, HATE GROUPS, WHOSE WHOLE FUNCTION AND EXISTENCE IS TO PROMOTE HATRED AGAINST BLACKS, GAYS, IMMIGRANTS, JEWS, CATHOLICS, ANYONE WHO IS DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE. I'M ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE SAD TRUTH THAT FOR MANY, MANY YEARS YOU HAVE UNARMED AFRICAN AMERICANS KILLED WHILE IN POLICE CUSTODY. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED MAJOR, MAJOR REFORMS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. I WAS THE MAYOR OF BURLINGTON FOR EIGHT YEARS AND I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS COUNTRY WORK HARD. MANY OF THEM ARE UNDERPAID, OVERWORKED. MANY HAVE CRAZY SCHEDULES WHICH IMPACT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT LIKE ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL, WHEN A POLICE OFFICER BREAKS THE LAW, THAT OFFICER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CREATING THE NATION WE MUST BECOME, IN MY VIEW, WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE 11 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND, IN MY VIEW, WE SHOULD NOT BE DEMAGOGUE IN THIS PEOPLE. WE SHOULD NOT BE ATTACKING THEM IN A VICIOUS LANGUAGE. WE SHOULD NOT BE CALLING THEM RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE HARD-WORKING. IN NIGHT VIEW, WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY IS MOVED TOWARDS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND A PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF YOU KNOW -- I WISH I COULD TELL YOU DIFFERENTLY BUT IT'S THE TRUTH -- WE LIVE IN A VERY CRAZY, COMPLICATED, DANGEROUS WORLD. TURN ON THE TV AND YOU SEE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU NAUSEOUS. CUTTING OFF PEOPLE'S HEADS, TURNING CHILDREN INTO SEXUAL SLAVES. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THINGS. I WILL TELL YOU -- ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY HAVE A MAGICAL SOLUTION TO THESE PROBLEMS IS NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I HEARD WHAT GEORGE W. BUSH AND DICK CHENEY AND DONALD RUMSFELD HAD TO SAY ABOUT IRAQ BACK IN 2002. I LISTENED TO WHAT THEY SAID. I ANALYZED TO WHAT THEY SAID AND I CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. [APPLAUSE] I AM NOT PROUD OR HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT IF YOU GO TO YOUTUBE OR MY WEBSITE AND READ WHAT I SAID BACK THEN ABOUT MY FEARS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE DESTABILIZATION OF THAT REGION, A LOT OF WHAT I SAID TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE ANOTHER GLOBAL SITUATION, FOREIGN POLICY SITUATION. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT I'M RON NOT GET A -- IRAN NOT GET EIGHT NUCLEAR WEAPON. WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WITHOUT GOING TO WAR. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT WITH THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY KERRY HAVE NEGOTIATED BUT I THINK A GREAT NATION LIKE OURS SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT WITHOUT GOING TO WAR UNDERSTANDING THAT WAR IS THE LAST RESORT NOT THE FIRST RESORT. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR SANDERS: MANY OF YOU BEEN VERY PATIENT. IT'S PROBABLY A TOPIC THERE AS IT IS A YEAR. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS. WE ARE THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE WORLD, WE ARE A SMART PEOPLE AND AN INCREDIBLY HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. IF WE DO NOT LET SOME DIVIDE US UP BY WHETHER WE ARE BLACK OR WHITE OR HISPANIC OR ASIAN, IF WE DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO DIVIDE US UP INTO WHETHER WE ARE A MAN OR WOMAN WHETHER WE ARE GAY OR WHETHER WE ARE STRAIGHT WHETHER WE'RE BORN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BORN SOMEWHERE ELSE, WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH. EVERYTHING THAT I'VE TOLD YOU, THIS IS NOT UTOPIAN, THIS IS STUFF THAT EXISTS IN MANY CASES IN OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO TO MAKE THESE THINGS HAPPEN PLEASE ENGAGE IN A POLITICAL REVOLUTION WHICH SAYS THAT MILLIONS OF OUR FRIENDS WHO DON'T KNOW WHO HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE POLITICAL PROCESS, THEY HAVE GOT TO GET INVOLVED THEY GOT TO START STANDING UP AND FIGHTING NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR SANDERS: THAT'S ALL. THAT'S WHAT A POLITICAL REVOLUTION IS ABOUT. IN SAYING NO AND NOT ASKING HER TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME DISCUSSING THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY AS WE DO WORRIED ABOUT THE NEWINGTON PATRIOTS. I WOULD NOT ASK THAT OF YOU. THAT IS TOO MUCH. BUT AT LEAST LET'S REACH OUT TO OUR FRIENDS AND SAY WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY LET STAND TOGETHER AND MAKE THIS POLITICAL REVOLUTION. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR SANDERS: THANK YOU. WHO HAS THE MIC? LET'S TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. >> I FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE GREAT THINGS YOU HAVE DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY. SENATOR SANDERS: THANK YOU. >> I'M A STUDENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I WILL BE VOTING IN THE NEXT ELECTION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MATTERS MOST TO MYSELF AND TO A GROWING GENERATION OF YOUNGER VOTERS OF MILLENNIAL'S IS INTERNET PRIVACY. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AND SURVEILLANCE. SENATOR SANDERS: THANK YOU. EXCELLENT QUESTION. IT'S FUNNY. VERMONT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE ON ISSUES OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND PRIVACY, I THINK WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY. STRONGER THAN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. I'VE HONESTLY HEARD PEOPLE SAY TO ME I DON'T CARE. I'M NOT A TERRORIST WHAT DO I CARE. I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY SAD STATEMENT. I THINK THE PRIVACY RIGHTS, THE RIGHT TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE READ WHATEVER YOU WANT TO READ, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT. BY THE WAY IT'S NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT CORPORATE AMERICA'S BUSINESS AS WELL. THEY HAVE MORE INFORMATION [APPLAUSE] SENATOR SANDERS: I WANT YOU TO KNOW COUPLE OF THINGS. IT IS CLEAR TO EVERYBODY OR SHOULD BE THE TECHNOLOGY AS FAR OUTPACED PUBLIC POLICY. YOU KNOW THAT THIS LITTLE THINGAMAJIG HERE ENABLES SOMEBODY TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM AT THIS MOMENT. THAT'S A FACT. BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS INTERCEPTING OF YOUR PHONE CALLS AND LOGGING THEM AND BETWEEN CORPORATE AMERICA KNOWING EVERYTHING YOU BUY AND MAYBE GETTING INTO YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS IN YOUR BANKING RECORDS, I THINK WE'VE SEEN A HUGE INVASION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND AMERICAN PRIVACY. LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. NUMBER ONE YOU ARE LOOKING AT A GUY WHEN IT WAS NOT POPULAR, THIS WAS AFTER 9/11 I VOTED AGAINST THE USA PATRIOT ACT. AND THAT WAS NOT POPULAR. I VOTED AGAINST THE REAUTHORIZATION BECAUSE I BELIEVE -- DO I BELIEVE THE TERRORISM OF THE REAL THREAT TO THIS COUNTRY? I SURELY DO. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HURT US AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE, BUT I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE PUBLIC POLICY HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH TECHNOLOGY. TECHNOLOGY IS EXPLODING EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN MY VIEW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE THEIR LIVES WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE AMERICA KNOWING AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS THEY CURRENTLY DO. >> I CAME FROM PENNSYLVANIA TO HELP WITH YOUR OFFICE OPENING IN MANCHESTER AND BEFORE I GO HOME I JUST WANTED US TO A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERTURNING CITIZENS UNITED. CONGRESS STILL FUNCTIONS THE SAME WAY DID IN 1700S BY HAVING REPRESENTATIVES WHO REPRESENT CORPORATE INTERESTS, WE TODAY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO REPRESENT OURSELVES IN THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE BY SIMPLY LOGGING ONTO WEBSITE DO YOU THINK THE KEY TO A POLITICAL REVOLUTION TO OVERRULE CITIZENS UNITED IS TO BRING CONGRESS INTO THE 21ST CENTURY BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES DIRECTLY IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS? SENATOR SANDERS: I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DO BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET HAVE RADICALLY TRANSFORMED THE NATURE OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. FROM A VERY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW, MY CAMPAIGN WOULD NOT BE DOING AS WELL AS IT IS IF WE WERE NOT COMMUNICATING WITH MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. I WOULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN SAYING I THINK WE'VE GOT TO EXPAND THE ABILITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND AS PRESIDENT I WOULD CERTAINLY DO THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN JUST RUN THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE INTERNET. I'M OLD-FASHIONED ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ELECTING PEOPLE TO REPRESENT US. [APPLAUSE] >> I'M A LITTLE FASHION TO. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE IDEA OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND HELPING PEOPLE VOTE. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT HAS BEEN SAID COULD BE DONE IS TO HAVE A DAY OFF ON ELECTION DAYS TO WORKING PEOPLE COULD GET TO THE POLLS AND VOTE AND SET OF HAVING TO GIVE UP THEIR DAYS PAY TO BE ABLE TO GO VOTE. ANOTHER SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO INVESTIGATE THE MOTIVATION BEHIND WHAT I WOULD CALL THE DISENFRANCHISEMENT MOVEMENT OF KEEPING PEOPLE FROM VOTING WHICH SEEMS TO BE TAKING HOLD IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES. UNLIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THAT IF YOU COULD. SENATOR SANDERS: YOU'RE RIGHT ON BOTH COUNTS. WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO MAKE VOTING DAY A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. WE DONE THAT. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWER BOARD -- VOTER TURNOUTS OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH. A LOT OF REASONS FOR IT, BUT CLEARLY IN EVERY WAY WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS NOT HARDER. YOU ARE VERY KIND AND YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WE CALL VOTER SUPPRESSION. IT IS NOT QUESTIONABLE IT IS NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY CERTAIN STATES I.E. REPUBLICAN STATES WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES ARE IN FACT MAKING IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE. I WILL TELL YOU. I RUN FOR OFFICE, I HAVE TO GO OUT TO THE PEOPLE OF MY STATE AND TELL THEM WHAT I BELIEVE. IT HAS NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO ME TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT DISAGREE WITH ME. THAT'S COWARDLY. FOR ALL THOSE GOVERNORS AND ALL THOSE LEGISLATURES WHO ARE FIGURING OUT HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DEFEND YOUR POLITICAL IDEAS GET A NEW JOB. [APPLAUSE] >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. THIS IS A QUESTION REGARDING SOMETHING VERY DEAR TO ME AND I BELIEVE EXTREME IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. AS A MEMBER OF THE BIOLOGY COMMUNITY DOING RESEARCH AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, I WAS WONDERING WHAT SPECIFIC IDEAS YOU HAVE FOR POLICIES TO INCREASE AWARENESS EDUCATION AND ESPECIALLY FUNDING FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ESPECIALLY FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH. SENATOR SANDERS: ONE OF THE DISMAYING THING THAT IS GOING ON IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW A CONGRESS WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY A VERY RIGHT-WING REPUBLICAN PARTY AS THEY PREFER TO GIVE HUGE TAX BREAKS TO THE VERY WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY RATHER THAN INVEST IN EDUCATION AND IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. IF WE LOOK AT MEDICINE AMERICA WHERE WE ARE TODAY WE KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T GET A HANDLE AND TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF EFFECTIVE CURE OR TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER'S WERE GOING TO BE SPENDING UNBELIEVABLE SUMS OF MONEY. WE KNOW WE ARE SEEING A NEXT LOTION AND DIABETES AND AND OTHER ILLNESSES. I THINK OBVIOUSLY BOTH IN TERMS OF TRYING TO SAVE LIVES PREVENT SUFFERING, AND BY THE WAY LET ME THROW IN ANOTHER ISSUE MAYBE NOT YOUR ISSUE OF ANOTHER ISSUE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE HAVE A HUGE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. INVESTING IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE CAUSATION OF THOSE ILLNESSES AND FIGURE OUT WAYS WE CAN TREAT THEM IS THAT HUMAN AND SMART THING TO DO. AND BY THE WAY SAVES US MONEY. THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE ON THAT I WANT EVERYBODY HERE TO KNOW THAT IN AMERICA WE PAY BY FAR THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ONE OUT OF FIVE AMERICANS GO TO THE DOCTOR OF THE DOCTORATE SUPERSCRIPTION AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO FILL IT. WHAT SENSE IS THAT? WE'VE GOT TO DEMAND THAT WE HAVE LEGISLATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY STOPS RIPPING OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. COUPLE MORE. >> I JUST CAME UP FROM BOSTON. I'M A STUDENT AT NORTHEASTERN. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT MY DEBT IS GOING TO BE MASSIVE IN FIVE YEARS. EVERY YEAR MY TUITION A $63,000. FOR PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS AMERICA, TUITIONS ARE RIDICULOUSLY HIGH AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT ARE TRYING TO MAKE UP AGAINST THREE. BUT I'M CURRENTLY WORRIED ABOUT'S PRIVATE LOANS. THE INTEREST RATES ARE RIDICULOUS LEHIGH, MONTHLY TO BE A .26 AND AM ONE OF THE LOWEST OF MY FRIENDS. IT CAN GO UP TO 25. SENATOR SANDERS: THIS IS INSANITY. I GATHER THE QUESTION IS WORKING TO DO ABOUT IT. EVERYTHING BEING EQUAL, YOU WILL LEAVE SCHOOL DEEPLY IN DEBT AND PAY AN 8% INTEREST RATE AND PROBABLY PAY 20 TO 25% OF THE INCOME THAT YOU'RE EARNING WHEN YOU LEAVE SCHOOL. IT'S GOING TO TIRE HANDS AS TO WHAT YOU CAN DO IN YOUR LIFE AND LIMIT YOUR OPPORTUNITIES. I HAVE TALKED IN MY STATE TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE CRIME IN LIFE WAS THAT SHE WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND JUST OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WORKING WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE. EXACTLY THE KIND OF DOCTORS THAT WE NEED. HER DEATH WAS $300,000. WE HAVE A MAJOR DENTAL CRISIS IN AMERICA. NOT ENOUGH DENTISTS, NOT AFFORDABLE DENTISTRY. I TALKED TO A YOUNG WOMAN IN IOWA, LEFT DENTAL SCHOOL $400,000 IN DEBT. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO. LET ME SUMMARIZE BY SAYING YOU SHOULD NOT BE PAYING 8.2% INTEREST RATES. WHAT SENSE IS IT IF YOU GO OUT AND GET HOME AND YOU WANT TO REFINANCE YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO IT AT TWO OR 3%. WHY SHOULD YOU BE SECOND EIGHT OR 10%? WHAT OUR LEGISLATION DOES TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE IT SAYS TO YOU IS GO OUT AND GET THE LOWEST INTEREST RATE THAT YOU CAN THEY WILL BE A HELL OF A LOT LOWER THAN 8.2%. YOU WILL BE FROZEN. NUMBER TWO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE MAKING ALIENS OF DOLLARS IN PROFITS IF WE DO THOSE TWO THINGS, IT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER YOURS -- TOTAL STUDENT DEBT, WHAT YOU HAVE TO PAY OFF. PEOPLE SAY TO ME BURNING YOUR TO MAKE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION FREE AND LOWER STUDENT AT, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THAT? IT'S EXPENSIVE? WE WILL PAY FOR IT BY PUTTING ATTACKS ON WALL STREET SPECULATION. WHEN WALL STREET CRASHED THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY BAILED THEM OUT. IT'S WALL STREET'S TURN TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS. LAST QUESTION. >> I'M FROM MASSACHUSETTS. AS AN ENGINEERING STUDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS OUT THERE THAT REQUIRE TWO YEARS OF EXPERIENCE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET HIRED AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THAT, WHEN YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF STUDENTS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET A JOB THEY HAD TO GO AND GET AN INTERNSHIP AND A LOT OF THOSE INTERNSHIPS ARE HARD TO GET BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING FOR THOSE POSITIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THAT? SENATOR SANDERS: LET ME TELL YOU THIS. ON THE ISSUE OF INTERNSHIPS, IN MANY WAYS IT IS A MODERN FORM OF EXPLICATION. AND I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DID NOT FULLY APPRECIATE THAT UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO. SOMEONE INDICATED ME ON SIS YOU. HERE'S THE STORY AND I THINK IT'S RELEVANT TO YOUR WESTERN. IF A PERSON COMES FROM A FAMILY THAT HAS MONEY THAT PERSON CAN IN TURN FOR NOTHING MAKE CONTACTS LEARN WHAT HE OR SHE HAS TO LEARN RIGHT AND APPLY FOR A JOB. AND THEY SAY LOOK I INTERNED HERE AND YOU GET HIRED. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY? ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO AN INTERNSHIP OR ZERO PAY? YOU CAN DO THAT. WHAT I LEARNED FROM THAT. WE CHANGE OUR POLICIES IN WASHINGTON. WE HAVE INTERNS IN MY SENATE OFFICE. THOSE -- MOST INTERNS IN WASHINGTON ARE PAID ZERO. WE NOW PAY THEM THE HIGHEST RATES IN ANY OFFICE FOR JUST THAT REASON. NOT THE 12 BUCKS AN HOUR IS HIGH ON THE HALL, BUT AT LEAST THEY CAN STAY ALIVE WHILE GETTING THEIR INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE. LET ME THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING OUR HERE THIS MORNING. IT'S GOOD DISCUSSION, WE HAVE IN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO. I THINK WE STAND A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH YOUR HELP. IF WE DO WELL HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE I THINK WE WILL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PATH TOWARD VICTORY AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY AND WE WILL MAKE A POLITICAL REVOLUTION WALLY MAKE HISTORY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) >>",2015-11-07 17:59:23,2015-09-20,Seabrook,New Hampshire
http://www.c-span.org/video/?327834-1/governor-scott-walker-rwi-remarks-foreign-policy,Governor Scott Walker (R-WI) Remarks on Foreign Policy,Scott Walker,"P.M. EASTERN ON C-SPAN. WISCONSIN GOVERNOR AND 20 16TH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SCOTT WALKER WAS AT SOUTH CAROLINA CITADEL FRIDAY, WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY AND U.S. INTERESTS ABROAD. THIS COMES AS PART OF C-SPAN'S ROAD TO THE COVERAGE -- LOAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE COVERAGE. IT IS 30 MINUTES. >> GOOD AFTERNOON. LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN -- GOOD AFTERNOON. >> THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR. MY NAME IS EVAN OLIVER, VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER FOR COMING TODAY AND PROVIDING THIS LUNCH. IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU CADET OLIVER AND GOOD LUCK TO YOUR FUTURE SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY. WE APPRECIATE THAT. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU, THE CADETS OF THE CITADEL. THANK YOU ANTILIFE PARTICULAR TO THE CITADEL REPUBLICAN SOCIETY FOR YOUR HELP IN HOSTING NOT ONLY -- THANK YOU TO THE CADETS, IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS ABOUT REPUBLICAN SOCIETY FOR HELP IN HOSTING NOT ONLY ME BUT MY WIFE. THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD QUESTION WHETHER OUR LEADERS ARE ABLE TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME AND WHETHER OUR COUNTRY IS CAPABLE OF CONTINUED GREATNESS. THEY SUGGEST THAT AT BEST DAYS MAY HAVE ALREADY COME AND GONE. I DO NOT SHARE THAT VIEW OF AMERICA. YOU SEE, THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS CERTAINLY NOT DETERMINED BY THE POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON WHO MERELY FOLLOW WHILE OTHERS BELIEVED OR SPEND ALL THEIR DAYS DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM BUT NEVER ACTING. FUTURE LEADERS OF THIS EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY ARE SITTING HERE, IN THIS ROOM, AND IN SIMILAR PLACES ACROSS AMERICA. THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL JOIN THE MILITARY LIKE OTHERS ON THE FRONT LINES AROUND THE WORLD AND ACROSS OUR SERVICES, YOU, YOU ARE MODERN-DAY PATRIOTS. YOU WILL BE SWORN TO DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION AND KEEP DANGER FROM OUR SHORES, WILLING TO RISK YOUR LIVES AND LIBERTY. YOU WILL LEAD OTHERS INTO THE MASTER AS THEY RISK THERE'S -- INTO THE MASTER AS THEY RISK THERE IS. YOU WILL NOT SIGN UP TO BE NATION BUILDERS ARE DIPLOMATIC PONDS, YOU WILL BE WARRIORS TO FREEDOM. AMERICA NEED NOT FEAR WHEN THE SELECT OF THE CORE OF THE CADETS REPORTS FOR DUTY. WHEN MANY OF YOU TAKE THE OATH, YOU WILL MAKE YOU -- YOU WILL BE MAKING A SOLEMN PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. TODAY, I WILL MAKE ONE TO YOU. IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND YOU INTO BATTLE WHEN, AND ONLY WHEN, OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS AT RISK, AND I WILL SEND YOU WITH A PLAN FOR VICTORY. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR COMMANDER AND CHIEF, OUR FORCES WILL BE STRONG, OUR WEAPONS WILL BE MODERN, AND AMERICA WILL BE AN INTIMIDATED. -- WILL BE ON INTIMIDATED. TODAY, I HAVE A QUESTION -- ARE WE SAFER NOW THAN WE WERE SEVEN YEARS AGO? ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES SHOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON. [LAUGHTER] SADLY, I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS NO. AMERICA IS NOT SAFER. SINCE SECRETARY CLINTON TOOK CHARGE OF OUR NATION'S DIPLOMACY, WE ABANDONED AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD, FORGOTTEN THAT AMERICA IS AN EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY AND LOST FAITH IN AMERICA'S ABILITY TO INFLUENCE WORLD EVENTS. THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. HILLARY CLINTON TO APPEASE VLADIMIR PUTIN WITH THE RESET BUTTON. SENSING WEAKNESS, HE HAS REJOINED THE MAP OF EUROPE WITH LOADED GUNS. HE IS DISMEMBERING UKRAINE, TRYING TO DESTROY NATO, AND THREATENING TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HILLARY CLINTON A PIVOT TO ASIA THAT PROVED HOLLOW, AND SHE DOWNPLAYED CHINA'S ABYSMAL HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS. THIS IS THE RESULT -- THE CHINESE ARE AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDING THEIR TERRITORIES, BUILDING ISLANDS OF MILITARY BASES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. PAGING CONDUCTS MASSIVE CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, STEALING CLASSIFIED MILITARY DATA, SEALING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, AND STEALING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SADLY, THERE IS MORE. HILLARY CLINTON, HILLARY CLINTON PUSHED FOR THE WAR IN LIBYA. THEN SHE STOOD BY THE CASKETS OF CHRISTOPHER STEVENS, SEAN SMITH, TYRONE WOODS, AND GLENN DOHERTY. SHE STOOD BY THE CASKETS, LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THEIR PARENTS AND POINTED TO A YOUTUBE VIDEO SHE KNEW, SHE KNEW WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THEIR DEATHS IN BENGHAZI. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. TODAY, LIBYA IS OFFICIALLY A TERRORIST SAFE HAVEN. WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THESE AND OTHER DISASTERS, CONSEQUENCES OF HER DECISIONS AS SECRETARY OF STATE. EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS TOUCHED IS WORSE OFF TODAY THAN BEFORE SHE AND THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE. EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS THAT 2014 WAS THE MOST LETHAL YEAR FOR TOURISM, FOR TERRORISM IN THE 45 YEARS. THE MOST LETHAL YEAR FOR TERRORISM IN THE 45 YEARS THAT THEY HAD COLLECTED DATA. THE OBAMA-CLINTON FOREIGN-POLICY OF LEADING FROM BEHIND IS NOT WORKING AND SADLY, WE'RE HEADED TOWARD THE DISASTER. IN THE REAL WORLD, THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON, WHEN YOU FAIL AT ONE JOB, YOU DO NOT GET PROMOTED TO ANOTHER. YOU GET FIRED. POLITICAL RHETORIC ON THAT KEEP US SAFE. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF A PRESIDENT WHO PROCLAIMS THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS IS CLIMATE CHANGE. AMERICA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. AT THE VERY LEAST, YOU ALL HERE AND OTHERS LIKE YOU ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, YOU DESERVE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO TELLS YOU THE TRUTH . HERE IT IS -- WE ARE AT WAR. AT WAR WITH RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. IT WILL NOT GO AWAY OVERNIGHT. THIS IS A GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE AND THESE RADICAL GROUPS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IF WE DO NOT DESTROY THEM. YES, THE WORLD IS COMPLEX, BUT THERE ARE SIMPLE THINGS OUT THERE. THERE IS GOOD AND THERE IS FAT. AMERICA -- THERE IS GOOD AND THERE IS BAD. AMERICA IS A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD, BUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ARE AGENTS APPEAR EVIL. -- AGENTS OF HER EVIL. NEXT WEEK, THE 70 ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II, AS WE LOOK BACK, THIS SHOULD REMIND US OF OUR WORLD OF AMERICANS. OUR HISTORY OF BEING CALLED AT TIMES TO CONFRONT FANATICAL EVIL . CONSIDER ISIS, THE BEST TRAINED IN THE BEST FUNDED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD. IT IS CARVED OUT OF CALIPHATE AND BUILT A TERRORIST ARMY IN THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST. EACH DAY, IT GROWS STRONGER, ATTRACTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS AND JIHADIST FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. ISIS ENSLAVES CHRISTIAN MINORITIES, TARGETS THE JEWISH PEOPLE, AND BURNS INNOCENT MUSLIMS ALIVE IN CAGES. ISIS MILITANTS RAPE GIRLS AS IN THIS NINE AND SO WOMEN INTO SEX SLAVERY. THE HUMAN TOLL OF THESE EVIL, UNTHINKABLE ACTIONS IS IMMEASURABLE. CURING GUTWRENCHING STORIES OF AMERICANS HELD HOSTAGE, TORTURED, RAPED, AND EXECUTED BY THESE RADICALS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, AND BY THE STRENGTH OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, AMERICA CAN AND WILL DEFEAT THIS EVIL AND ERADICATE THIS THREAT TO AMERICA. ISIS IS A RADICAL PERVERSION OF SUNNI ISLAM, BUT THERE IS ANOTHER FACE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND THAT IS A SHIITE REGIME IN IRAN. TODAY, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN REMAINS THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. YOU SEE, IRAN IS NOT THE COUNTRY WE SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS WITH . I STILL REMEMBER TYING RIBBONS AROUND THE TREE IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE WITH WHITE BROTHER DURING THE 444 DAYS THAT I RAN -- THAT IRAN HAD 52 AMERICANS HOSTAGE. IRAN HAS NOT CHANGED A MUCH IN THE 3.5 DECADES INSTEAD. EVEN AS WE SPEAK, IRAN IS HOLDING CULTURAL OTHER AMERICANS . -- FOUR OTHER AMERICANS. TODAY MARKS THE CAPTURE ANNIVERSARY OF A MARINE. I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE MAYOR'S IN MICHIGAN AND HURT THE ENGLISH AND STORY -- AMIR'S FAMILY IN MICHIGAN AND IT IS A SHAME THAT AMERICANS LIKE BUSH AND IRANIAN PRISONS FALL AMERICA IS FREEING UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE WORLD'S LEADING SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. AND LEGITIMIZING THEIR MASSIVE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. IT IS NOT JUST THE HOSTAGES WHOM PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ABANDONED IN THIS DEAL, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN AT YAHOO! IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THE DEAL PUTS US ALL IN DANGER. IRAN WILL EXPAND ITS DESTRUCTIVE INFLUENCE IN IRAQ, SYRIA, LEBANON, AND INCREASED SUPPORT TO PROXIES LIKE HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH WHICH SEEK TO DESTROY PLACES LIKE ISRAEL. CONFRONTED BY THESE FORMS OF EVIL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON SEEMS SOMEHOW TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN SIT ON THE SIDELINES HOPING IRAN WILL DEFEAT ISIS FOR THE. THEY FAIL TO REALIZE THAT IN THIS PREVAILING ANARCHY, THE TWO SIDES FEED OFF OF EACH OTHER, GROWING STRONGER AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR SUNNI AND SHIA ALLIES TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE. OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, WE HAVE SEEN FAR TOO MUCH OF THIS DELUSION AND WISHFUL THINKING TO BELIEVE THAT A STABLE AND LASTING MIDDLE EAST CAN BE BUILT BY WORKING WITH IRAN ANYMORE THAN BY WORKING WITH ISIS AS A STATEMENT SHIP. IT IS PURE FANTASY. THE DEBT FOR RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM IS REAL AND IT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE OUR TEACHING TRACES ON AMERICAN SOIL IN THE UoATTACKS ON FORT HOOD, BOSTON, AND CHATTANOOGA. I HAVE A PLAN TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN SAFE FROM THE THREATS OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. FIRST, WE NEED TO SECURE OUR HOMELAND. TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO ADMIT THAT ARE SEVEN BORDER IS RIDDLED WITH HOLES. YOU SEE, EX -- THE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AND OTHER TERRORISTS ARE MOST LIKELY USING THE SAME TRAILS INTO OUR HOMELAND AS THE DRUG CARTELS, THE WEAPON SMUGGLERS, AND THE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. WE MUST SECURE OUR BORDER AT ANY COST. AN ADDITION, WE MUST PROVIDE THE PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY TO MAINTAIN IT BUT THERE IS MORE. THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING ISIS IN ALL 50 STATES. WE NEED TO RESTORE COUNTERTERRORISM, SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS, INVEST INTO CYBER TOOLS, AND IMPROVE INTELLIGENCE AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION TO CATCH TERRORISTS BEFORE THEY STRIKE. NEXT, WE NEED TO FIGHT TERRORISTS ABROAD BEFORE THEY COME TO AMERICA. SINCE MANY OF YOU CADETS WILL BE PART OF THAT FIGHT, I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL FIGHT TO WIN. WE WILL FIGHT TO WIN. FAR FROM BEATING ISIS, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS BARELY DISRUPTING. HIS ACTUAL GOAL IS TO CONTAIN ISIS UNTIL HE LEAVES OFFICE, ALL WHILE ACCOMMODATING IRAN. MY GOAL WILL BE TO DEFEAT ISIS AT 12 BACK IRAN'S INFLUENCE IN THE REGION. YOU SEE, THESE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES WILL GUIDE OUR MILITARY COMMANDERS. LET ME BE CLEAR, DEFEATING ISIS AND ROLLING BACK IRAN WILL REQUIRE A GREATER INVESTMENT OF U.S. RESOURCES. STERNLY WORDED TWEETS AND ISOLATED AIRSTRIKES WILL NOT DESTROY THIS ENEMY. AS WE LEARNED IN THE SEARCH, EMBEDDED AMERICAN ADVISERS ARE KEY TO TRAINING AND MOTIVATING IRAQIS, SUNNI TRIBAL'S, AND KURDISH ALLIES. THEY CAN PROVIDE GOOD INTELLIGENCE, BUT JUST A GULF RESOURCES, AND CALL IN CLOSE AIR SUPPORT TO DIRECT DEVASTATING STRIKES THAT WILL BOLSTER OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND. TODAY, HOWEVER, THE ADMINISTRATION IS KIND OF OUR TROOPS WITH POLITICAL RESTRICTIONS, PREVENTING THEM FROM DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO DEFEAT ISIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS MUST BE LIFTED IMMEDIATELY AND ALL THE OPTIONS MUST REMAIN ON THE TABLE . WE NEED TO STOP MICROMANAGING THE MILITARY AND BROADCASTING ARE LIMITS TO OUR ENEMIES. AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I WILL MAKE THESE DECISIONS THEY ON SOUND MILITARY COUNCIL RATHER THAN POLITICAL OR BUREAUCRATIC ADVICE. IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BACK AWAY FROM HIS RED WINE AND AS LONG AS ISIS HAS A SAFE HAVEN IN SYRIA, IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN IRAQ. BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION RUNWAY FROM ITS RED WINE, SERIOUS TYRANT ASSAULT REMAINS IN POWER AND IS A MAGNET FOR RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. NO STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS CAN SUCCEED WHILE ASSAD IS STILL IN POWER AND IRAN IS PATRON HAS A BASE OF OPERATIONS IN DAMASCUS. THEREFORE, WE MUST DO MORE THAN RECRUIT. WE MUST DO MORE TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT FIGHTERS IN SYRIA WHO OPPOSE BOTH ISIS AND ASSAD. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS TRAINED ONLY ABOUT 60 FIGHTERS. THAT IS JUST NOT GOING TO CUT IT. THAT IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT. A NO-FLY ZONE ENFORCED BY AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES WOULD DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE THIS CAMPAIGN ON THE GROUND. OUR EFFORTS IN SYRIA AND IRAQ MUST BE PART OF A BROADER, U.S. LED REGIONAL COALITION, WITH REAL BY AN AND IRONCLAD GUARANTEES FROM OUR I -- FROM OUR ALLIES THAT THEY WILL HELP US SHOULDER THIS BURDEN. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE NEXT STEP . THE NEXT STEP FOR DEFEATING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, WE NEED TO STAND WITH OUR FRIENDS. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS CALLED THE LEADER, THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. OUR ALLIES ARE AMONGST OUR GREATEST RESOURCE IS A STRENGTH. AS WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE SAID, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WORSE THAN FIGHTING WITH OUR ALLIES AND THAT IS WITH FIGHTING WITH THEM. ADDING SUPPORT FROM ALLIES ONLY STRENGTHENS OUR POSITION TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM , WE NEED TO RESTORE ALLIANCES ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR TRADITIONAL ALLY IS ISRAEL AND THE SUNNI ARAB STATES ARE DIVIDED ON MANY ISSUES. ONE THREAT YOU NOT TO THE MALL, THE THREAT FROM IRAN AND ITS PROXIES. -- ONE THREAT UNITES THEM ALL -- BUT THAT FROM IRAN AND ITS PROXIES. THERE SHOULD BE NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES. IN CONTRAST, WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS CONSULT THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL. SADLY, THEY NEVER SEEM TO CRITICIZE IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER AND THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDERS WHO HAVE OPPRESSED PEOPLE OF IRAN AND WHO HELPED KILL THOUSANDS OF OUR SHOULDERS -- OF OUR SOLDIERS IN IRAQ. PRESIDENT OBAMA RECENTLY COMPARED CRITICS OF HIS DEAL TO THESE MURDERERS. THIS IS DISGRACEFUL. IT IGNORES THE VERY REAL OPPOSITION TO THE DEAL WITH IRAN FROM PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND ALL ACROSS PARTY LINES. HILLARY CLINTON WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN LAUNCHING THE ADMINISTRATION'S SHORTSIGHTED OVERTURES TO IRAN, AND NOW, SHE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS BAD DEAL. HER DISREGARD FOR TOP-SECRET, CLASSIFIED, AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON HER E-MAIL SERVER SHOWS THAT SHE CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. HER SUPPORT FOR THE BAD DEAL IN IRAN SHOWS SHE SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED TO SUPPORT ISRAEL. IF THIS DEAL GOES FORWARD, IT WILL BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FOREIGN-POLICY FAILURES IN U.S. HISTORY. LET ME BE CLEAR, IF CONGRESS FAILS TO STOP THE NUCLEAR DEAL, I WILL TERMINATED ON DAY ONE. THEN I WILL IMMEDIATELY REIMPOSE SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN AND WORK WITH CONGRESS TO IMPOSE EVEN MORE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS GOING FORWARD. UNLIKE OTHERS, I DO NOT NEED MONTHS OR YEARS TO MULL THIS OVER. I DO NOT NEED TO APPOINT A CABINET OR CONSULT A COMMITTEE. ANYBODY WHO DOES NOT KNOW TODAY, TODAY, THAT IRAN DEAL IS A BAD DEAL, IS NOT READY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. I AM READY TO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ON DAY ONE. I WILL ALSO WORK TO CONVINCE OUR ALLIES TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD ON IRAN. SO WE ARE CLEAR -- I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS THAT THIS WILL BE EASY , BUT WHEN AMERICA -- BUT WHEN DID AMERICA SHOULD GO IT FROM THE CHALLENGES? I REJECT OBAMA-CLINTON CHOICE BETWEEN THIS BAD DEAL AND ANOTHER WAR. I VOWED TO TURN A PRESSURE ACROSS THE BOARD ON IRAN. I REFUSE TO LIVE WITH THE DEAL THAT THREATENS OUR SAFETY AND THAT OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS PART OF A BROADER EFFORT TO DOMINATE THE REGION THAT THREATENS OUR SUNNI ARAB ALLIES. ONCE YOU SHOW THEM THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO ROLLING BACK THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF IRAN, IT WILL ENCOURAGE OUR ALLIES TO JOIN US IN OUR EFFORTS AGAINST ISIS. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON REFUSED TO SUPPORT THOSE INSIDE IRAN WHO SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE OPPRESSION OF THIS MACHINE, SOMEHOW WARNING THAT IT WOULD UNDERMINE THEIR OUTREACH TO THE SUPREME LEADERS. THIS IS WRONG. AMERICA MUST ALWAYS BE A BRIGHT AND STEADY ECONOMIC HOPE FOR FREEDOM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. NEXT, DEFEATING ISIS AND ROLLING BACK IRAN WILL REQUIRE US TO REBUILD AND REFORM THE TOOLS OF AMERICAN POWER. MANY OF YOU CADETS WILL ENTER THE MILITARY THAT SADLY HAS BEEN DECIMATED BY POLITICIANS. SHOCKINGLY, THE FINEST MILITARY FORCE EVER ASSEMBLED IS BEING DISMANTLED AT THE TIME WHEN THE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE GROWING EVERYWHERE. AS AN AMERICAN, THIS ANGERS ME. NOT AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, BUT AS AN AMERICAN. MANY OF YOU ARE GETTING READY TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US AND WE THANK YOU. YOU DESERVE BETTER. AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO KEEP US SAFE OF ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, AND I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE ARMED ON AMERICAN SOIL SO YOU ANOTHER SERVICE MEMBERS ARE SAFE HERE AS WELL. STRONG MILITARY IS IMPORTANT. NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIGHT, BUT SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO. WHEN PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN REBUILT OUR ARMED FORCES, IT LED TO ONE OF THE MOST PEACEFUL TIMES IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY . OUR ENEMIES FEARED US NOT BECAUSE WE WERE EAGER TO GO INTO BATTLE BUT BECAUSE THEY KNEW WE COULD AND WE WOULD IF IT WERE NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVED IN ACHIEVING PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH . I DID, TOO. AND I WILL FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE. THE POLICY OF THE WALKER ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TO CONFRONT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM USING THE FULL RANGE OF OUR OPTIONS. YOU MUST GIVE OUR INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS THE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL TOLLS THEY NEED -- TOOLS THEY NEED TO KEEP US SAFE. WE MUST USE ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS TO DENY ISIS AND IRAN THE MONEY THEY NEED TO FUND THEIR ACTS OF TERROR. AND WE MUST IDENTIFY AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST RADICAL FORMS OF ISLAM THAT INSIDE IT. -- INCITE IT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THE FIGHT AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING HOW WE CONFRONT THE CHALLENGE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. HOW CAN WE DO FOR OR TO TURN, HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY DETER OUR SOPHISTICATED ADVERSARIES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE COMPETITORS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IF WE CANNOT DEFEAT THE BARBARIANS OF ISIS AND ROLLBACK THE THREATS OF TERROR ON -- IN TERAN? WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BE PASSIVE WHILE THE WORLD A SENSE OF THE CHAOS. OF ALL THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AROUND THE GLOBE TODAY, NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR UNTESTED LEADERSHIP. I HAVE BEEN TESTED LIKE NO OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE. THE RETREAT IS OVER, AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS BACK. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS BACK. TOGETHER WITH OUR ALLIES, WE WILL NOT SURRENDER ANOTHER INCH OF GROUND TO TERRORISTS OR ANY OTHER POWER THAT THREATENS OUR SAFETY. AMERICA WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED AND NEITHER WILL I. AMERICA MUST BE, NOT ONLY THE LAND OF THE FREE, BUT THE HOME OF THE BRAVE. AND AMERICA THAT IS UNINTI MIDATED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WISCONSIN GOVERNOR AND 20 16TH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SCOTT WALKER WAS AT SOUTH CAROLINA CITADEL FRIDAY, WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY AND U.S. INTERESTS ABROAD. THIS COMES AS PART OF C-SPAN'S ROAD TO THE COVERAGE -- LOAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE COVERAGE. IT IS 30 MINUTES. >> GOOD AFTERNOON. LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN -- GOOD AFTERNOON. >> THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR. MY NAME IS EVAN OLIVER, VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER FOR COMING TODAY AND PROVIDING THIS LUNCH. IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU CADET OLIVER AND GOOD LUCK TO YOUR FUTURE SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY. WE APPRECIATE THAT. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU, THE CADETS OF THE CITADEL. THANK YOU ANTILIFE PARTICULAR TO THE CITADEL REPUBLICAN SOCIETY FOR YOUR HELP IN HOSTING NOT ONLY -- THANK YOU TO THE CADETS, IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS ABOUT REPUBLICAN SOCIETY FOR HELP IN HOSTING NOT ONLY ME BUT MY WIFE. THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD QUESTION WHETHER OUR LEADERS ARE ABLE TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME AND WHETHER OUR COUNTRY IS CAPABLE OF CONTINUED GREATNESS. THEY SUGGEST THAT AT BEST DAYS MAY HAVE ALREADY COME AND GONE. I DO NOT SHARE THAT VIEW OF AMERICA. YOU SEE, THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS CERTAINLY NOT DETERMINED BY THE POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON WHO MERELY FOLLOW WHILE OTHERS BELIEVED OR SPEND ALL THEIR DAYS DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM BUT NEVER ACTING. FUTURE LEADERS OF THIS EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY ARE SITTING HERE, IN THIS ROOM, AND IN SIMILAR PLACES ACROSS AMERICA. THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL JOIN THE MILITARY LIKE OTHERS ON THE FRONT LINES AROUND THE WORLD AND ACROSS OUR SERVICES, YOU, YOU ARE MODERN-DAY PATRIOTS. YOU WILL BE SWORN TO DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION AND KEEP DANGER FROM OUR SHORES, WILLING TO RISK YOUR LIVES AND LIBERTY. YOU WILL LEAD OTHERS INTO THE MASTER AS THEY RISK THERE'S -- INTO THE MASTER AS THEY RISK THERE IS. YOU WILL NOT SIGN UP TO BE NATION BUILDERS ARE DIPLOMATIC PONDS, YOU WILL BE WARRIORS TO FREEDOM. AMERICA NEED NOT FEAR WHEN THE SELECT OF THE CORE OF THE CADETS REPORTS FOR DUTY. WHEN MANY OF YOU TAKE THE OATH, YOU WILL MAKE YOU -- YOU WILL BE MAKING A SOLEMN PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. TODAY, I WILL MAKE ONE TO YOU. IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND YOU INTO BATTLE WHEN, AND ONLY WHEN, OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS AT RISK, AND I WILL SEND YOU WITH A PLAN FOR VICTORY. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR COMMANDER AND CHIEF, OUR FORCES WILL BE STRONG, OUR WEAPONS WILL BE MODERN, AND AMERICA WILL BE AN INTIMIDATED. -- WILL BE ON INTIMIDATED. TODAY, I HAVE A QUESTION -- ARE WE SAFER NOW THAN WE WERE SEVEN YEARS AGO? ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES SHOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON. [LAUGHTER] SADLY, I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS NO. AMERICA IS NOT SAFER. SINCE SECRETARY CLINTON TOOK CHARGE OF OUR NATION'S DIPLOMACY, WE ABANDONED AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD, FORGOTTEN THAT AMERICA IS AN EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY AND LOST FAITH IN AMERICA'S ABILITY TO INFLUENCE WORLD EVENTS. THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. HILLARY CLINTON TO APPEASE VLADIMIR PUTIN WITH THE RESET BUTTON. SENSING WEAKNESS, HE HAS REJOINED THE MAP OF EUROPE WITH LOADED GUNS. HE IS DISMEMBERING UKRAINE, TRYING TO DESTROY NATO, AND THREATENING TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HILLARY CLINTON A PIVOT TO ASIA THAT PROVED HOLLOW, AND SHE DOWNPLAYED CHINA'S ABYSMAL HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS. THIS IS THE RESULT -- THE CHINESE ARE AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDING THEIR TERRITORIES, BUILDING ISLANDS OF MILITARY BASES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. PAGING CONDUCTS MASSIVE CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, STEALING CLASSIFIED MILITARY DATA, SEALING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, AND STEALING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SADLY, THERE IS MORE. HILLARY CLINTON, HILLARY CLINTON PUSHED FOR THE WAR IN LIBYA. THEN SHE STOOD BY THE CASKETS OF CHRISTOPHER STEVENS, SEAN SMITH, TYRONE WOODS, AND GLENN DOHERTY. SHE STOOD BY THE CASKETS, LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THEIR PARENTS AND POINTED TO A YOUTUBE VIDEO SHE KNEW, SHE KNEW WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THEIR DEATHS IN BENGHAZI. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. TODAY, LIBYA IS OFFICIALLY A TERRORIST SAFE HAVEN. WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THESE AND OTHER DISASTERS, CONSEQUENCES OF HER DECISIONS AS SECRETARY OF STATE. EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS TOUCHED IS WORSE OFF TODAY THAN BEFORE SHE AND THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE. EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS THAT 2014 WAS THE MOST LETHAL YEAR FOR TOURISM, FOR TERRORISM IN THE 45 YEARS. THE MOST LETHAL YEAR FOR TERRORISM IN THE 45 YEARS THAT THEY HAD COLLECTED DATA. THE OBAMA-CLINTON FOREIGN-POLICY OF LEADING FROM BEHIND IS NOT WORKING AND SADLY, WE'RE HEADED TOWARD THE DISASTER. IN THE REAL WORLD, THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON, WHEN YOU FAIL AT ONE JOB, YOU DO NOT GET PROMOTED TO ANOTHER. YOU GET FIRED. POLITICAL RHETORIC ON THAT KEEP US SAFE. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF A PRESIDENT WHO PROCLAIMS THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS IS CLIMATE CHANGE. AMERICA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. AT THE VERY LEAST, YOU ALL HERE AND OTHERS LIKE YOU ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, YOU DESERVE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO TELLS YOU THE TRUTH . HERE IT IS -- WE ARE AT WAR. AT WAR WITH RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. IT WILL NOT GO AWAY OVERNIGHT. THIS IS A GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE AND THESE RADICAL GROUPS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IF WE DO NOT DESTROY THEM. YES, THE WORLD IS COMPLEX, BUT THERE ARE SIMPLE THINGS OUT THERE. THERE IS GOOD AND THERE IS FAT. AMERICA -- THERE IS GOOD AND THERE IS BAD. AMERICA IS A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD, BUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ARE AGENTS APPEAR EVIL. -- AGENTS OF HER EVIL. NEXT WEEK, THE 70 ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II, AS WE LOOK BACK, THIS SHOULD REMIND US OF OUR WORLD OF AMERICANS. OUR HISTORY OF BEING CALLED AT TIMES TO CONFRONT FANATICAL EVIL . CONSIDER ISIS, THE BEST TRAINED IN THE BEST FUNDED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD. IT IS CARVED OUT OF CALIPHATE AND BUILT A TERRORIST ARMY IN THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST. EACH DAY, IT GROWS STRONGER, ATTRACTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS AND JIHADIST FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

THE HUMAN TOLL OF THESE EVIL, UNTHINKABLE ACTIONS IS IMMEASURABLE. CURING GUTWRENCHING STORIES OF AMERICANS HELD HOSTAGE, TORTURED, RAPED, AND EXECUTED BY THESE RADICALS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, AND BY THE STRENGTH OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, AMERICA CAN AND WILL DEFEAT THIS EVIL AND ERADICATE THIS THREAT TO AMERICA. ISIS IS A RADICAL PERVERSION OF SUNNI ISLAM, BUT THERE IS ANOTHER FACE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND THAT IS A SHIITE REGIME IN IRAN. TODAY, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN REMAINS THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. YOU SEE, IRAN IS NOT THE COUNTRY WE SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS WITH . I STILL REMEMBER TYING RIBBONS AROUND THE TREE IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE WITH WHITE BROTHER DURING THE 444 DAYS THAT I RAN -- THAT IRAN HAD 52 AMERICANS HOSTAGE. IRAN HAS NOT CHANGED A MUCH IN THE 3.5 DECADES INSTEAD. EVEN AS WE SPEAK, IRAN IS HOLDING CULTURAL OTHER AMERICANS . -- FOUR OTHER AMERICANS. TODAY MARKS THE CAPTURE ANNIVERSARY OF A MARINE. I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE MAYOR'S IN MICHIGAN AND HURT THE ENGLISH AND STORY -- AMIR'S FAMILY IN MICHIGAN AND IT IS A SHAME THAT AMERICANS LIKE BUSH AND IRANIAN PRISONS FALL AMERICA IS FREEING UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE WORLD'S LEADING SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. AND LEGITIMIZING THEIR MASSIVE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. IT IS NOT JUST THE HOSTAGES WHOM PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ABANDONED IN THIS DEAL, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN AT YAHOO! IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THE DEAL PUTS US ALL IN DANGER. IRAN WILL EXPAND ITS DESTRUCTIVE INFLUENCE IN IRAQ, SYRIA, LEBANON, AND INCREASED SUPPORT TO PROXIES LIKE HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH WHICH SEEK TO DESTROY PLACES LIKE ISRAEL.

AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I WILL MAKE THESE DECISIONS THEY ON SOUND MILITARY COUNCIL RATHER THAN POLITICAL OR BUREAUCRATIC ADVICE. IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BACK AWAY FROM HIS RED WINE AND AS LONG AS ISIS HAS A SAFE HAVEN IN SYRIA, IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN IRAQ. BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION RUNWAY FROM ITS RED WINE, SERIOUS TYRANT ASSAULT REMAINS IN POWER AND IS A MAGNET FOR RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. NO STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS CAN SUCCEED WHILE ASSAD IS STILL IN POWER AND IRAN IS PATRON HAS A BASE OF OPERATIONS IN DAMASCUS. THEREFORE, WE MUST DO MORE THAN RECRUIT. WE MUST DO MORE TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT FIGHTERS IN SYRIA WHO OPPOSE BOTH ISIS AND ASSAD. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS TRAINED ONLY ABOUT 60 FIGHTERS. THAT IS JUST NOT GOING TO CUT IT. THAT IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT. A NO-FLY ZONE ENFORCED BY AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES WOULD DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE THIS CAMPAIGN ON THE GROUND. OUR EFFORTS IN SYRIA AND IRAQ MUST BE PART OF A BROADER, U.S. LED REGIONAL COALITION, WITH REAL BY AN AND IRONCLAD GUARANTEES FROM OUR I -- FROM OUR ALLIES THAT THEY WILL HELP US SHOULDER THIS BURDEN. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE NEXT STEP . THE NEXT STEP FOR DEFEATING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, WE NEED TO STAND WITH OUR FRIENDS. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS CALLED THE LEADER, THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. OUR ALLIES ARE AMONGST OUR GREATEST RESOURCE IS A STRENGTH. AS WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE SAID, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WORSE THAN FIGHTING WITH OUR ALLIES AND THAT IS WITH FIGHTING WITH THEM. ADDING SUPPORT FROM ALLIES ONLY STRENGTHENS OUR POSITION TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM , WE NEED TO RESTORE ALLIANCES ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR TRADITIONAL ALLY IS ISRAEL AND THE SUNNI ARAB STATES ARE DIVIDED ON MANY ISSUES. ONE THREAT YOU NOT TO THE MALL, THE THREAT FROM IRAN AND ITS PROXIES. -- ONE THREAT UNITES THEM ALL -- BUT THAT FROM IRAN AND ITS PROXIES. THERE SHOULD BE NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES. IN CONTRAST, WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS CONSULT THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL. SADLY, THEY NEVER SEEM TO CRITICIZE IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER AND THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDERS WHO HAVE OPPRESSED PEOPLE OF IRAN AND WHO HELPED KILL THOUSANDS OF OUR SHOULDERS -- OF OUR SOLDIERS IN IRAQ. PRESIDENT OBAMA RECENTLY COMPARED CRITICS OF HIS DEAL TO THESE MURDERERS. THIS IS DISGRACEFUL. IT IGNORES THE VERY REAL OPPOSITION TO THE DEAL WITH IRAN FROM PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND ALL ACROSS PARTY LINES. HILLARY CLINTON WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN LAUNCHING THE ADMINISTRATION'S SHORTSIGHTED OVERTURES TO IRAN, AND NOW, SHE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS BAD DEAL. HER DISREGARD FOR TOP-SECRET, CLASSIFIED, AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON HER E-MAIL SERVER SHOWS THAT SHE CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. HER SUPPORT FOR THE BAD DEAL IN IRAN SHOWS SHE SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED TO SUPPORT ISRAEL. IF THIS DEAL GOES FORWARD, IT WILL BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FOREIGN-POLICY FAILURES IN U.S. HISTORY. LET ME BE CLEAR, IF CONGRESS FAILS TO STOP THE NUCLEAR DEAL, I WILL TERMINATED ON DAY ONE. THEN I WILL IMMEDIATELY REIMPOSE SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN AND WORK WITH CONGRESS TO IMPOSE EVEN MORE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS GOING FORWARD. UNLIKE OTHERS, I DO NOT NEED MONTHS OR YEARS TO MULL THIS OVER. I DO NOT NEED TO APPOINT A CABINET OR CONSULT A COMMITTEE. ANYBODY WHO DOES NOT KNOW TODAY, TODAY, THAT IRAN DEAL IS A BAD DEAL, IS NOT READY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. I AM READY TO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ON DAY ONE. I WILL ALSO WORK TO CONVINCE OUR ALLIES TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD ON IRAN. SO WE ARE CLEAR -- I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS THAT THIS WILL BE EASY , BUT WHEN AMERICA -- BUT WHEN DID AMERICA SHOULD GO IT FROM THE CHALLENGES? I REJECT OBAMA-CLINTON CHOICE BETWEEN THIS BAD DEAL AND ANOTHER WAR. I VOWED TO TURN A PRESSURE ACROSS THE BOARD ON IRAN. I REFUSE TO LIVE WITH THE DEAL THAT THREATENS OUR SAFETY AND THAT OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS PART OF A BROADER EFFORT TO DOMINATE THE REGION THAT THREATENS OUR SUNNI ARAB ALLIES. ONCE YOU SHOW THEM THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO ROLLING BACK THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF IRAN, IT WILL ENCOURAGE OUR ALLIES TO JOIN US IN OUR EFFORTS AGAINST ISIS. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON REFUSED TO SUPPORT THOSE INSIDE IRAN WHO SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE OPPRESSION OF THIS MACHINE, SOMEHOW WARNING THAT IT WOULD UNDERMINE THEIR OUTREACH TO THE SUPREME LEADERS. THIS IS WRONG. AMERICA MUST ALWAYS BE A BRIGHT AND STEADY ECONOMIC HOPE FOR FREEDOM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. NEXT, DEFEATING ISIS AND ROLLING BACK IRAN WILL REQUIRE US TO REBUILD AND REFORM THE TOOLS OF AMERICAN POWER. MANY OF YOU CADETS WILL ENTER THE MILITARY THAT SADLY HAS BEEN DECIMATED BY POLITICIANS. SHOCKINGLY, THE FINEST MILITARY FORCE EVER ASSEMBLED IS BEING DISMANTLED AT THE TIME WHEN THE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE GROWING EVERYWHERE. AS AN AMERICAN, THIS ANGERS ME. NOT AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, BUT AS AN AMERICAN. MANY OF YOU ARE GETTING READY TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US AND WE THANK YOU. YOU DESERVE BETTER. AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO KEEP US SAFE OF ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, AND I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE ARMED ON AMERICAN SOIL SO YOU ANOTHER SERVICE MEMBERS ARE SAFE HERE AS WELL. STRONG MILITARY IS IMPORTANT. NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIGHT, BUT SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO. WHEN PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN REBUILT OUR ARMED FORCES, IT LED TO ONE OF THE MOST PEACEFUL TIMES IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY . OUR ENEMIES FEARED US NOT BECAUSE WE WERE EAGER TO GO INTO BATTLE BUT BECAUSE THEY KNEW WE COULD AND WE WOULD IF IT WERE NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVED IN ACHIEVING PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH . I DID, TOO. AND I WILL FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE. THE POLICY OF THE WALKER ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TO CONFRONT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM USING THE FULL RANGE OF OUR OPTIONS. YOU MUST GIVE OUR INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS THE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL TOLLS THEY NEED -- TOOLS THEY NEED TO KEEP US SAFE. WE MUST USE ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS TO DENY ISIS AND IRAN THE MONEY THEY NEED TO FUND THEIR ACTS OF TERROR. AND WE MUST IDENTIFY AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST RADICAL FORMS OF ISLAM THAT INSIDE IT. -- INCITE IT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THE FIGHT AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING HOW WE CONFRONT THE CHALLENGE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. HOW CAN WE DO FOR OR TO TURN, HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY DETER OUR SOPHISTICATED ADVERSARIES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE COMPETITORS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IF WE CANNOT DEFEAT THE BARBARIANS OF ISIS AND ROLLBACK THE THREATS OF TERROR ON -- IN TERAN? WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BE PASSIVE WHILE THE WORLD A SENSE OF THE CHAOS. OF ALL THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AROUND THE GLOBE TODAY, NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR UNTESTED LEADERSHIP. I HAVE BEEN TESTED LIKE NO OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE. THE RETREAT IS OVER, AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS BACK. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS BACK. TOGETHER WITH OUR ALLIES, WE WILL NOT SURRENDER ANOTHER INCH OF GROUND TO TERRORISTS OR ANY OTHER POWER THAT THREATENS OUR SAFETY. AMERICA WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED AND NEITHER WILL I. AMERICA MUST BE, NOT ONLY THE LAND OF THE FREE, BUT THE HOME OF THE BRAVE. AND AMERICA THAT IS UNINTI MIDATED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?328419-1/former-governor-jeb-bush-rfl-energy-policy-address,Former Governor Jeb Bush (R-FL) Energy Policy Address,Jeb Bush,"P.M. EASTERN ON C-SPAN. WISCONSIN GOVERNOR AND 20 16TH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SCOTT WALKER WAS AT SOUTH CAROLINA CITADEL FRIDAY, WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY AND U.S. INTERESTS ABROAD. THIS COMES AS PART OF C-SPAN'S ROAD TO THE COVERAGE -- LOAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE COVERAGE. IT IS 30 MINUTES. >> GOOD AFTERNOON. LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN -- GOOD AFTERNOON. >> THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR. MY NAME IS EVAN OLIVER, VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER FOR COMING TODAY AND PROVIDING THIS LUNCH. IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR WALKER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU CADET OLIVER AND GOOD LUCK TO YOUR FUTURE SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY. WE APPRECIATE THAT. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU, THE CADETS OF THE CITADEL. THANK YOU ANTILIFE PARTICULAR TO THE CITADEL REPUBLICAN SOCIETY FOR YOUR HELP IN HOSTING NOT ONLY -- THANK YOU TO THE CADETS, IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS ABOUT REPUBLICAN SOCIETY FOR HELP IN HOSTING NOT ONLY ME BUT MY WIFE. THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD QUESTION WHETHER OUR LEADERS ARE ABLE TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME AND WHETHER OUR COUNTRY IS CAPABLE OF CONTINUED GREATNESS. THEY SUGGEST THAT AT BEST DAYS MAY HAVE ALREADY COME AND GONE. I DO NOT SHARE THAT VIEW OF AMERICA. YOU SEE, THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS CERTAINLY NOT DETERMINED BY THE POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON WHO MERELY FOLLOW WHILE OTHERS BELIEVED OR SPEND ALL THEIR DAYS DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM BUT NEVER ACTING. FUTURE LEADERS OF THIS EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY ARE SITTING HERE, IN THIS ROOM, AND IN SIMILAR PLACES ACROSS AMERICA. THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL JOIN THE MILITARY LIKE OTHERS ON THE FRONT LINES AROUND THE WORLD AND ACROSS OUR SERVICES, YOU, YOU ARE MODERN-DAY PATRIOTS. YOU WILL BE SWORN TO DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION AND KEEP DANGER FROM OUR SHORES, WILLING TO RISK YOUR LIVES AND LIBERTY. YOU WILL LEAD OTHERS INTO THE MASTER AS THEY RISK THERE'S -- INTO THE MASTER AS THEY RISK THERE IS. YOU WILL NOT SIGN UP TO BE NATION BUILDERS ARE DIPLOMATIC PONDS, YOU WILL BE WARRIORS TO FREEDOM. AMERICA NEED NOT FEAR WHEN THE SELECT OF THE CORE OF THE CADETS REPORTS FOR DUTY. WHEN MANY OF YOU TAKE THE OATH, YOU WILL MAKE YOU -- YOU WILL BE MAKING A SOLEMN PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. TODAY, I WILL MAKE ONE TO YOU. IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND YOU INTO BATTLE WHEN, AND ONLY WHEN, OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS AT RISK, AND I WILL SEND YOU WITH A PLAN FOR VICTORY. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR COMMANDER AND CHIEF, OUR FORCES WILL BE STRONG, OUR WEAPONS WILL BE MODERN, AND AMERICA WILL BE AN INTIMIDATED. -- WILL BE ON INTIMIDATED. TODAY, I HAVE A QUESTION -- ARE WE SAFER NOW THAN WE WERE SEVEN YEARS AGO? ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES SHOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON. [LAUGHTER] SADLY, I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS NO. AMERICA IS NOT SAFER. SINCE SECRETARY CLINTON TOOK CHARGE OF OUR NATION'S DIPLOMACY, WE ABANDONED AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD, FORGOTTEN THAT AMERICA IS AN EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY AND LOST FAITH IN AMERICA'S ABILITY TO INFLUENCE WORLD EVENTS. THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. HILLARY CLINTON TO APPEASE VLADIMIR PUTIN WITH THE RESET BUTTON. SENSING WEAKNESS, HE HAS REJOINED THE MAP OF EUROPE WITH LOADED GUNS. HE IS DISMEMBERING UKRAINE, TRYING TO DESTROY NATO, AND THREATENING TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HILLARY CLINTON A PIVOT TO ASIA THAT PROVED HOLLOW, AND SHE DOWNPLAYED CHINA'S ABYSMAL HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS. THIS IS THE RESULT -- THE CHINESE ARE AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDING THEIR TERRITORIES, BUILDING ISLANDS OF MILITARY BASES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. PAGING CONDUCTS MASSIVE CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, STEALING CLASSIFIED MILITARY DATA, SEALING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, AND STEALING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SADLY, THERE IS MORE. HILLARY CLINTON, HILLARY CLINTON PUSHED FOR THE WAR IN LIBYA. THEN SHE STOOD BY THE CASKETS OF CHRISTOPHER STEVENS, SEAN SMITH, TYRONE WOODS, AND GLENN DOHERTY. SHE STOOD BY THE CASKETS, LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THEIR PARENTS AND POINTED TO A YOUTUBE VIDEO SHE KNEW, SHE KNEW WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THEIR DEATHS IN BENGHAZI. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. TODAY, LIBYA IS OFFICIALLY A TERRORIST SAFE HAVEN. WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THESE AND OTHER DISASTERS, CONSEQUENCES OF HER DECISIONS AS SECRETARY OF STATE. EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS TOUCHED IS WORSE OFF TODAY THAN BEFORE SHE AND THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE. EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS THAT 2014 WAS THE MOST LETHAL YEAR FOR TOURISM, FOR TERRORISM IN THE 45 YEARS. THE MOST LETHAL YEAR FOR TERRORISM IN THE 45 YEARS THAT THEY HAD COLLECTED DATA. THE OBAMA-CLINTON FOREIGN-POLICY OF LEADING FROM BEHIND IS NOT WORKING AND SADLY, WE'RE HEADED TOWARD THE DISASTER. IN THE REAL WORLD, THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON, WHEN YOU FAIL AT ONE JOB, YOU DO NOT GET PROMOTED TO ANOTHER. YOU GET FIRED. POLITICAL RHETORIC ON THAT KEEP US SAFE. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF A PRESIDENT WHO PROCLAIMS THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS IS CLIMATE CHANGE. AMERICA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. AT THE VERY LEAST, YOU ALL HERE AND OTHERS LIKE YOU ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, YOU DESERVE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO TELLS YOU THE TRUTH . HERE IT IS -- WE ARE AT WAR. AT WAR WITH RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. IT WILL NOT GO AWAY OVERNIGHT. THIS IS A GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE AND THESE RADICAL GROUPS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IF WE DO NOT DESTROY THEM. YES, THE WORLD IS COMPLEX, BUT THERE ARE SIMPLE THINGS OUT THERE. THERE IS GOOD AND THERE IS FAT. AMERICA -- THERE IS GOOD AND THERE IS BAD. AMERICA IS A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD, BUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ARE AGENTS APPEAR EVIL. -- AGENTS OF HER EVIL. NEXT WEEK, THE 70 ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II, AS WE LOOK BACK, THIS SHOULD REMIND US OF OUR WORLD OF AMERICANS. OUR HISTORY OF BEING CALLED AT TIMES TO CONFRONT FANATICAL EVIL . CONSIDER ISIS, THE BEST TRAINED IN THE BEST FUNDED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD. IT IS CARVED OUT OF CALIPHATE AND BUILT A TERRORIST ARMY IN THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST. EACH DAY, IT GROWS STRONGER, ATTRACTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS AND JIHADIST FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. ISIS ENSLAVES CHRISTIAN MINORITIES, TARGETS THE JEWISH PEOPLE, AND BURNS INNOCENT MUSLIMS ALIVE IN CAGES. ISIS MILITANTS RAPE GIRLS AS IN THIS NINE AND SO WOMEN INTO SEX SLAVERY. THE HUMAN TOLL OF THESE EVIL, UNTHINKABLE ACTIONS IS IMMEASURABLE. CURING GUTWRENCHING STORIES OF AMERICANS HELD HOSTAGE, TORTURED, RAPED, AND EXECUTED BY THESE RADICALS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, AND BY THE STRENGTH OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, AMERICA CAN AND WILL DEFEAT THIS EVIL AND ERADICATE THIS THREAT TO AMERICA. ISIS IS A RADICAL PERVERSION OF SUNNI ISLAM, BUT THERE IS ANOTHER FACE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND THAT IS A SHIITE REGIME IN IRAN. TODAY, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN REMAINS THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. YOU SEE, IRAN IS NOT THE COUNTRY WE SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS WITH . I STILL REMEMBER TYING RIBBONS AROUND THE TREE IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE WITH WHITE BROTHER DURING THE 444 DAYS THAT I RAN -- THAT IRAN HAD 52 AMERICANS HOSTAGE. IRAN HAS NOT CHANGED A MUCH IN THE 3.5 DECADES INSTEAD. EVEN AS WE SPEAK, IRAN IS HOLDING CULTURAL OTHER AMERICANS . -- FOUR OTHER AMERICANS. TODAY MARKS THE CAPTURE ANNIVERSARY OF A MARINE. I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE MAYOR'S IN MICHIGAN AND HURT THE ENGLISH AND STORY -- AMIR'S FAMILY IN MICHIGAN AND IT IS A SHAME THAT AMERICANS LIKE BUSH AND IRANIAN PRISONS FALL AMERICA IS FREEING UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE WORLD'S LEADING SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. AND LEGITIMIZING THEIR MASSIVE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. IT IS NOT JUST THE HOSTAGES WHOM PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ABANDONED IN THIS DEAL, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN AT YAHOO! IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THE DEAL PUTS US ALL IN DANGER. IRAN WILL EXPAND ITS DESTRUCTIVE INFLUENCE IN IRAQ, SYRIA, LEBANON, AND INCREASED SUPPORT TO PROXIES LIKE HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH WHICH SEEK TO DESTROY PLACES LIKE ISRAEL. CONFRONTED BY THESE FORMS OF EVIL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON SEEMS SOMEHOW TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN SIT ON THE SIDELINES HOPING IRAN WILL DEFEAT ISIS FOR THE. THEY FAIL TO REALIZE THAT IN THIS PREVAILING ANARCHY, THE TWO SIDES FEED OFF OF EACH OTHER, GROWING STRONGER AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR SUNNI AND SHIA ALLIES TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE. OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, WE HAVE SEEN FAR TOO MUCH OF THIS DELUSION AND WISHFUL THINKING TO BELIEVE THAT A STABLE AND LASTING MIDDLE EAST CAN BE BUILT BY WORKING WITH IRAN ANYMORE THAN BY WORKING WITH ISIS AS A STATEMENT SHIP. IT IS PURE FANTASY. THE DEBT FOR RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM IS REAL AND IT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE OUR TEACHING TRACES ON AMERICAN SOIL IN THE UoATTACKS ON FORT HOOD, BOSTON, AND CHATTANOOGA. I HAVE A PLAN TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN SAFE FROM THE THREATS OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. FIRST, WE NEED TO SECURE OUR HOMELAND. TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO ADMIT THAT ARE SEVEN BORDER IS RIDDLED WITH HOLES. YOU SEE, EX -- THE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AND OTHER TERRORISTS ARE MOST LIKELY USING THE SAME TRAILS INTO OUR HOMELAND AS THE DRUG CARTELS, THE WEAPON SMUGGLERS, AND THE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. WE MUST SECURE OUR BORDER AT ANY COST. AN ADDITION, WE MUST PROVIDE THE PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY TO MAINTAIN IT BUT THERE IS MORE. THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING ISIS IN ALL 50 STATES. WE NEED TO RESTORE COUNTERTERRORISM, SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS, INVEST INTO CYBER TOOLS, AND IMPROVE INTELLIGENCE AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION TO CATCH TERRORISTS BEFORE THEY STRIKE. NEXT, WE NEED TO FIGHT TERRORISTS ABROAD BEFORE THEY COME TO AMERICA. SINCE MANY OF YOU CADETS WILL BE PART OF THAT FIGHT, I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL FIGHT TO WIN. WE WILL FIGHT TO WIN. FAR FROM BEATING ISIS, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS BARELY DISRUPTING. HIS ACTUAL GOAL IS TO CONTAIN ISIS UNTIL HE LEAVES OFFICE, ALL WHILE ACCOMMODATING IRAN. MY GOAL WILL BE TO DEFEAT ISIS AT 12 BACK IRAN'S INFLUENCE IN THE REGION. YOU SEE, THESE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES WILL GUIDE OUR MILITARY COMMANDERS. LET ME BE CLEAR, DEFEATING ISIS AND ROLLING BACK IRAN WILL REQUIRE A GREATER INVESTMENT OF U.S. RESOURCES. STERNLY WORDED TWEETS AND ISOLATED AIRSTRIKES WILL NOT DESTROY THIS ENEMY. AS WE LEARNED IN THE SEARCH, EMBEDDED AMERICAN ADVISERS ARE KEY TO TRAINING AND MOTIVATING IRAQIS, SUNNI TRIBAL'S, AND KURDISH ALLIES. THEY CAN PROVIDE GOOD INTELLIGENCE, BUT JUST A GULF RESOURCES, AND CALL IN CLOSE AIR SUPPORT TO DIRECT DEVASTATING STRIKES THAT WILL BOLSTER OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND. TODAY, HOWEVER, THE ADMINISTRATION IS KIND OF OUR TROOPS WITH POLITICAL RESTRICTIONS, PREVENTING THEM FROM DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO DEFEAT ISIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS MUST BE LIFTED IMMEDIATELY AND ALL THE OPTIONS MUST REMAIN ON THE TABLE . WE NEED TO STOP MICROMANAGING THE MILITARY AND BROADCASTING ARE LIMITS TO OUR ENEMIES. AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I WILL MAKE THESE DECISIONS THEY ON SOUND MILITARY COUNCIL RATHER THAN POLITICAL OR BUREAUCRATIC ADVICE. IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BACK AWAY FROM HIS RED WINE AND AS LONG AS ISIS HAS A SAFE HAVEN IN SYRIA, IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN IRAQ. BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION RUNWAY FROM ITS RED WINE, SERIOUS TYRANT ASSAULT REMAINS IN POWER AND IS A MAGNET FOR RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. NO STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS CAN SUCCEED WHILE ASSAD IS STILL IN POWER AND IRAN IS PATRON HAS A BASE OF OPERATIONS IN DAMASCUS. THEREFORE, WE MUST DO MORE THAN RECRUIT. WE MUST DO MORE TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT FIGHTERS IN SYRIA WHO OPPOSE BOTH ISIS AND ASSAD. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS TRAINED ONLY ABOUT 60 FIGHTERS. THAT IS JUST NOT GOING TO CUT IT. THAT IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT. A NO-FLY ZONE ENFORCED BY AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES WOULD DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE THIS CAMPAIGN ON THE GROUND. OUR EFFORTS IN SYRIA AND IRAQ MUST BE PART OF A BROADER, U.S. LED REGIONAL COALITION, WITH REAL BY AN AND IRONCLAD GUARANTEES FROM OUR I -- FROM OUR ALLIES THAT THEY WILL HELP US SHOULDER THIS BURDEN. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE NEXT STEP . THE NEXT STEP FOR DEFEATING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, WE NEED TO STAND WITH OUR FRIENDS. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS CALLED THE LEADER, THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. OUR ALLIES ARE AMONGST OUR GREATEST RESOURCE IS A STRENGTH. AS WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE SAID, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WORSE THAN FIGHTING WITH OUR ALLIES AND THAT IS WITH FIGHTING WITH THEM. ADDING SUPPORT FROM ALLIES ONLY STRENGTHENS OUR POSITION TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM , WE NEED TO RESTORE ALLIANCES ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR TRADITIONAL ALLY IS ISRAEL AND THE SUNNI ARAB STATES ARE DIVIDED ON MANY ISSUES. ONE THREAT YOU NOT TO THE MALL, THE THREAT FROM IRAN AND ITS PROXIES. -- ONE THREAT UNITES THEM ALL -- BUT THAT FROM IRAN AND ITS PROXIES. THERE SHOULD BE NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES. IN CONTRAST, WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS CONSULT THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL. SADLY, THEY NEVER SEEM TO CRITICIZE IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER AND THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDERS WHO HAVE OPPRESSED PEOPLE OF IRAN AND WHO HELPED KILL THOUSANDS OF OUR SHOULDERS -- OF OUR SOLDIERS IN IRAQ. PRESIDENT OBAMA RECENTLY COMPARED CRITICS OF HIS DEAL TO THESE MURDERERS. THIS IS DISGRACEFUL. IT IGNORES THE VERY REAL OPPOSITION TO THE DEAL WITH IRAN FROM PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND ALL ACROSS PARTY LINES. HILLARY CLINTON WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN LAUNCHING THE ADMINISTRATION'S SHORTSIGHTED OVERTURES TO IRAN, AND NOW, SHE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS BAD DEAL. HER DISREGARD FOR TOP-SECRET, CLASSIFIED, AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON HER E-MAIL SERVER SHOWS THAT SHE CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. HER SUPPORT FOR THE BAD DEAL IN IRAN SHOWS SHE SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED TO SUPPORT ISRAEL. IF THIS DEAL GOES FORWARD, IT WILL BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FOREIGN-POLICY FAILURES IN U.S. HISTORY. LET ME BE CLEAR, IF CONGRESS FAILS TO STOP THE NUCLEAR DEAL, I WILL TERMINATED ON DAY ONE. THEN I WILL IMMEDIATELY REIMPOSE SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN AND WORK WITH CONGRESS TO IMPOSE EVEN MORE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS GOING FORWARD. UNLIKE OTHERS, I DO NOT NEED MONTHS OR YEARS TO MULL THIS OVER. I DO NOT NEED TO APPOINT A CABINET OR CONSULT A COMMITTEE. ANYBODY WHO DOES NOT KNOW TODAY, TODAY, THAT IRAN DEAL IS A BAD DEAL, IS NOT READY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. I AM READY TO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ON DAY ONE. I WILL ALSO WORK TO CONVINCE OUR ALLIES TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD ON IRAN. SO WE ARE CLEAR -- I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS THAT THIS WILL BE EASY , BUT WHEN AMERICA -- BUT WHEN DID AMERICA SHOULD GO IT FROM THE CHALLENGES? I REJECT OBAMA-CLINTON CHOICE BETWEEN THIS BAD DEAL AND ANOTHER WAR. I VOWED TO TURN A PRESSURE ACROSS THE BOARD ON IRAN. I REFUSE TO LIVE WITH THE DEAL THAT THREATENS OUR SAFETY AND THAT OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS PART OF A BROADER EFFORT TO DOMINATE THE REGION THAT THREATENS OUR SUNNI ARAB ALLIES. ONCE YOU SHOW THEM THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO ROLLING BACK THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF IRAN, IT WILL ENCOURAGE OUR ALLIES TO JOIN US IN OUR EFFORTS AGAINST ISIS. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON REFUSED TO SUPPORT THOSE INSIDE IRAN WHO SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE OPPRESSION OF THIS MACHINE, SOMEHOW WARNING THAT IT WOULD UNDERMINE THEIR OUTREACH TO THE SUPREME LEADERS. THIS IS WRONG. AMERICA MUST ALWAYS BE A BRIGHT AND STEADY ECONOMIC HOPE FOR FREEDOM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. NEXT, DEFEATING ISIS AND ROLLING BACK IRAN WILL REQUIRE US TO REBUILD AND REFORM THE TOOLS OF AMERICAN POWER. MANY OF YOU CADETS WILL ENTER THE MILITARY THAT SADLY HAS BEEN DECIMATED BY POLITICIANS. SHOCKINGLY, THE FINEST MILITARY FORCE EVER ASSEMBLED IS BEING DISMANTLED AT THE TIME WHEN THE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE GROWING EVERYWHERE. AS AN AMERICAN, THIS ANGERS ME. NOT AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, BUT AS AN AMERICAN. MANY OF YOU ARE GETTING READY TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US AND WE THANK YOU. YOU DESERVE BETTER. AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO KEEP US SAFE OF ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, AND I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE ARMED ON AMERICAN SOIL SO YOU ANOTHER SERVICE MEMBERS ARE SAFE HERE AS WELL. STRONG MILITARY IS IMPORTANT. NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIGHT, BUT SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO. WHEN PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN REBUILT OUR ARMED FORCES, IT LED TO ONE OF THE MOST PEACEFUL TIMES IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY . OUR ENEMIES FEARED US NOT BECAUSE WE WERE EAGER TO GO INTO BATTLE BUT BECAUSE THEY KNEW WE COULD AND WE WOULD IF IT WERE NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVED IN ACHIEVING PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH . I DID, TOO. AND I WILL FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE. THE POLICY OF THE WALKER ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TO CONFRONT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM USING THE FULL RANGE OF OUR OPTIONS. YOU MUST GIVE OUR INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS THE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL TOLLS THEY NEED -- TOOLS THEY NEED TO KEEP US SAFE. WE MUST USE ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS TO DENY ISIS AND IRAN THE MONEY THEY NEED TO FUND THEIR ACTS OF TERROR. AND WE MUST IDENTIFY AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST RADICAL FORMS OF ISLAM THAT INSIDE IT. -- INCITE IT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THE FIGHT AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING HOW WE CONFRONT THE CHALLENGE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. HOW CAN WE DO FOR OR TO TURN, HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY DETER OUR SOPHISTICATED ADVERSARIES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE COMPETITORS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IF WE CANNOT DEFEAT THE BARBARIANS OF ISIS AND ROLLBACK THE THREATS OF TERROR ON -- IN TERAN? WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BE PASSIVE WHILE THE WORLD A SENSE OF THE CHAOS. OF ALL THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AROUND THE GLOBE TODAY, NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR UNTESTED LEADERSHIP. I HAVE BEEN TESTED LIKE NO OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE. THE RETREAT IS OVER, AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS BACK. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS BACK. TOGETHER WITH OUR ALLIES, WE WILL NOT SURRENDER ANOTHER INCH OF GROUND TO TERRORISTS OR ANY OTHER POWER THAT THREATENS OUR SAFETY. AMERICA WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED AND NEITHER WILL I. AMERICA MUST BE, NOT ONLY THE LAND OF THE FREE, BUT THE HOME OF THE BRAVE. AND AMERICA THAT IS UNINTI MIDATED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?328577-1/hillary-clinton-remarks-gun-violence,Hillary Clinton Remarks on Gun Violence,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"WE COVER IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AT C-SPAN.ORG. >> HILLARY CLINTON HELD A TOWN HALL MEETING IN MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK'S LAST SHOOTING -- MASS SHOOTING IN OREGON AND SPOKE WITH A MOTHER WHOSE SECURE OLD SON WAS KILLED IN THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTING -- SIX YEAR OLD WAS KILLED IN THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTING. >> LATEST GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME AARON STEVENS CALLING, AND HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE] >> FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE. PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE IN THE 20TH SEND IT DISTRICT -- SENATE DISTRICT. ALWAYS THINK OF LUDA LISANDRO. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO LISTEN TO A WOMAN WHO HAS EVERY CREDENTIAL POSSIBLE TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. [CHEERING] WE HAVE A WOMAN WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT GUNS. SHE IS NOT AFRAID TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE HAD ON -- HEAD ON. YOU ARE IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TODAY, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN OREGON. WE KNOW, WITH GREAT SADNESS, THAT THOSE WHO PASSED AWAY PASSED AWAY FOR NO REASON AT ALL. NONE WHATSOEVER. WE HAVE A WOMAN WHO HAS WITHIN HERSELF THE ABILITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. [APPLAUSE] YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR HER IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL ELECTION. [APPLAUSE] WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WILL INTRODUCE AARON CURRAN WHO IS THE WOMAN FROM THE NORTH AND -- SHE HAS THOSE TWO CHILDREN, SOCIOLOGY MAJOR, SOCIAL WORKER, SAID IT DID NOT PAY A LOT OF WORKER -- A LOT OF MONEY BUT SHE LOVES IT BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE. ISN'T THAT WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT? WE HESITATE ZERO PEOPLE -- WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY IS BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> HELLO. I WILL HAVE TO CHEAT A LITTLE BIT WITH MY PAPER, I AM NOT AS WELL PRACTICED. I AM THE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF INTRODUCING HILLARY CLINTON TODAY. I LIVE IN MANCHESTER AND MY HOME IS ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITY AND IN ANOTHER TIME, WE COULD HAVE POSED IN A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING. TO ME, THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES OF GUN VIOLENCE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN. WHAT DEALS LIKE A PAST LIFE, I WAS A SOCIAL WORKER AND I HANDLED MOSTLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. WHAT STRESSED ME OVER AND OVER WAS THE IMMEDIACY OF GUN VIOLENCE. WHEN GUNS ENTER A CONFLICT, THERE IS NO CHANCE TO RECONSIDER, IT IS JUST OVER. WATCHING THE ASSAULT WEAPON BRENT -- BAND EXPIRE IN 2004, I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE COULD NOT MAKE PROGRESS OR AN ACT POLICIES TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND DEATH FROM GUNS. LAST MONTH, EVERYTHING CHANGED FOR OUR FAMILY. A WOMAN NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM MYSELF OR ANYONE ELSE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SHOT AND KILLED ON MY STREET. IT WAS A SUNDAY EVENING AND THERE IS NO INFORMATION. MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN TO MY KIDS. THOMAS WHO IS TOO WIGGLY TO BE HERE TODAY IS IN FIRST GRADE AND ELEANOR IS IN -- THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SHOOTING, OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HAD A COOKOUT FOR EVERYONE ON THE STREET AND THE KIDS WERE RUNNING AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK INTO THE NIGHT. WHAT A DIFFERENCE 24 HOURS MIGHT HAVE MADE. IF YOU ARE A PARENT, GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION HAS TO BE AN ISSUE FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE A HUSBAND, A BROTHER, A SISTER, A WIFE, GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION HAS TO BE AN ISSUE FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] FROM OREGON TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN, GUN VIOLENCE IS LEAVING FAMILIES STRUGGLING WITH UNIMAGINABLE GRIEF AND LOSS. AS A NATION, WE CAN DO BETTER. IF WE ELECT THE RIGHT PERSON, THIS IS A FIGHT THAT WE CAN WIN. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS THE PERSON WHO CAN WIN THAT FIGHT FOR US. [APPLAUSE] SHE HAS THE TENACITY TO TACKLE GUN VIOLENCE AND SHE NEVER GIVES UP AND SHE HAS A RECORD OF ACHIEVING RESULTS. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THIS FIGHT AND JOIN ME IN WELCOMING OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, HILLARY CLINTON. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M DELIGHTED AND HONORED TO BE HERE. LUDA LISANDRO HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME, AND A SENATOR REPRESENTING THIS DISTRICT. I THANK HIM VERY MUCH FOR HIS SUPPORT AND HIS FRIENDSHIP. I WANT TO THANK ERIN AND ELEANOR FOR BEING WITH US. ERIN'S STORY IS UNFORTUNATELY WAY TOO COMMON. WE ARE HERE ON THE CAMPUS OF A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY COLLEGE, VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE IN OREGON. WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE GOING TO SCHOOL, AND SOME NOT SO YOUNG. THE VICTIMS I READ ARE BETWEEN 18 YEARS OLD AND 67 YEARS OLD. PEOPLE ATTENDING CLASSES AND IMPROVING THEIR SKILLS, TEACHING, LEARNING, THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. WHICH WAS SO ENDED, SENSELESSLY, TRAGICALLY. ON THAT VERY SAME DAY THAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN OREGON, A FIVE-MONTH-OLD BABY STRAPPED INTO HER CAR SEAT IN THE BACK OF A CAR WAS KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET IN CLEVELAND. THE THIRD BABY IN JUST A FEW MONTHS TO BE MURDERED IN CLEVELAND. BETWEEN 88 AND 92 PEOPLE A DAY ARE KILLED BY GUNS IN AMERICA. THE LAST FIGURES WE HAVE FOR A WHOLE YEAR IS MORE THAN 33,000. IT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN, THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE FOR YOUNG HISPANIC MEN, THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE FOR YOUNG WHITE MEN. THIS EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES. IT KNOWS NO LIMITS. AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS, PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO SAY THAT THEY OFFER THEIR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ACT? BEFORE WE COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: YOU KNOW, ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, MR. TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT IT AND SAID SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN IN THE WORLD. GOVERNOR BUSH SAID YEAH, STUFF HAPPENS. NO. THAT IS AN ADMISSION OF DEFEAT AND SURRENDER. TO A PROBLEM THAT IS KILLING 33,000 AMERICANS. IT IS TIME FOR US TO SAY WAIT A MINUTE, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. OUR COUNTRY IS BETTER THAN THIS. AND THERE ARE STEPS WE CAN TAKE -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IMPROVE GUN SAFETY AND FURTHER THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE BY GUNS. AND TODAY, IM -- I AM PROPOSING WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE COMMON SENSE APPROACHES. A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. IN FACT, A MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. WE HAD A BIPARTISAN BILL THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE SENATE. BUT WE NEED TO GO BACK AND, WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS, WORKING NOT JUST IN WASHINGTON, BUT FROM A GRASSROOTS UP, DEMAND THAT WE HAVE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND WE HAVE TO ALSO -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT WHAT IS CALLED THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE, AND WE'VE GOT WHAT'S NOW BEING CALLED THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE. WHEN THE BRADY BILL WAS PASSED, WHICH WASN'T EASY, AS YOU RECALL, BUT IT DID PASS. EXCEPTIONS WERE MADE FOR GUN SHOWS, AND THEN LATER, IT WAS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE ONLINE SALES. 40% OF GUNS ARE SOLD AT GUN SHOWS, ONLINE SALES. WE NEED TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE A UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: IT WILL COVER EVERYBODY. ANOTHER LOOPHOLE IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE YOUNG MAN WHO MURDERED THE NINE PEOPLE AT BIBLE STUDY, IN THE CHURCH BASEMENT IN CHARLESTON -- APPLIED FOR A GUN. THE LOOPHOLES THAT THEY DON'T GET THE BACKGROUND CHECK DONE IN THREE DAYS, YOU CAN STILL GO BY THE GUN. IT TURNS OUT HE HAD A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND, AND YOU KNOW HOW RECORD-KEEPING IS. PEOPLE WILL START -- WERE STILL SEARCHING THROUGH IT. AT THE END OF THREE DAYS, HE GOES AND BUYS A GUN, AS WE DON'T YET HAVE IT AUTOMATED ENOUGH, WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION SHARED FROM ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. AND HE GOT HIS GUN. AND WAS DETERMINED TO GO AND USE IT TO KILL NINE INNOCENT PEOPLE. WE ALSO MUST ADDRESS THE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM OF MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS ON OUR STREETS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHANCE. LOTS OF TIMES, WHEN TERRIBLE MURDERS LIKE THIS TAKE PLACE, SOMEONE WILL SAY IF WE ONLY HAD MORE GUNS. YOU WALK INTO CLASS, YOU ARE DRIVING YOUR BABY AROUND IN A CAR SEAT, YOU ARE GOING TO CHURCH. AND SOMEBODY HAS AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON, OR EVEN WORSE -- AN ASSAULT WEAPON THAT IS A MILITARY INSTRUMENT OF WAR, AND YOU ARE SOMEHOW SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO STOP THAT WITH YOUR OWN GUN? THAT HAS NEVER MADE ANY SENSE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. DOMESTIC ABUSERS, PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER TRACKING AND RECORD-KEEPING. I REMEMBER THE TERRIBLE MASSACRE AT VIRGINIA TECH. THE SHOOTER THERE HAD BEEN INVOLUNTARILY COMMITTED. AND THERE WAS NO RECORD OF IT. AND IF THERE IS INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCELLENT, -- EX FELONS, WHO ARE SUFFERING AND SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS, WHO ARE DOMESTIC ABUSERS, YOU GOT TO GET THAT INFORMATION INTO THE RECORD-KEEPING, SO THAT THE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL ACTUALLY SHOW YOU THAT HERE IS SOMEBODY WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE IT. PEOPLE SAY TO ME DOES THIS REALLY WORK? I CAN TELL YOU THIS. THE BEST DATA THAT WE HAVE IS THAT SINCE THE BRADY BILL IMPLEMENTED BACKGROUND CHECKS, MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STOPPED FROM BUYING A GUN. AND OVER ONE MILLION OF THOSE WERE FELONS. THERE WERE RECORDS OF THOSE PARTICULAR POTENTIAL PURCHASERS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND I WANT TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO WORK WITH SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY ADVOCATES AS WELL AS GUN OWNERS. I WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE FROM THE GRASSROOTS UP COME ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON. BECAUSE HOW MUCH LONGER WILL WE JUST SHRUG? OH MY GOSH, SOMETHING ELSE TERRIBLE HAPPENED. WHETHER IT'S IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OR, THE MURDER OF CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOMS? WE ARE TO GO TO THE TOWN HALL PORTION OF THIS. BUT I WANT TO ASK ONE OF THE MOTHERS FROM SANDY HOOK, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, TO JUST COME JOIN ME FOR A MINUTE. BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM HER. BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE PARENTS -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: YOU KNOW, SO MANY OF THE PARENTS OF THESE PRECIOUS CHILDREN WHO ARE MURDERED HAVE TAKEN THE UNIMAGINABLE GRIEF THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BEARING, AND HAVE TRIED TO BE THE VOICES THAT WE NEED TO HEAR. I WANT YOU TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND MAYBE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU AND OTHER PARENTS ARE TRYING TO DO TO GET THE CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY. >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS NICOLE HOCKLEY, AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR AT SANDY HOOK PROMISE AND ALSO THE MOTHER OF DYLAN, WHO WAS SIX YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS KILLED AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION WAS NOWHERE ON MY RADAR. BEFORE LOSING MY SON. I WISH IT HAD BEEN. I WISH I HAD DONE SOMETHING LONG BEFORE SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT COULD NEVER HIT MY COMMUNITY HIT ME. AS PART OF SANDY HOOK PROMISE, WE FOCUS VERY MUCH ON GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION. AND THE COMMONSENSE PRACTICES YOU ARE SPEAKING OF, SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON AND SPEAKING OUT. WE ALSO VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET AHEAD OF THE VIOLENCE? TO GET UPSTREAM OF IT AND HELP IDENTIFY AND INTERVENE, HELP PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO KNOW THE SIGNS OF SOMEONE WHO IS AT RISK, AND GET HELP BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO THE STATE OF PICKING UP A WEAPON TO HURT SOMEONE ELSE. I THINK IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT IS NEEDED BETWEEN GUN ACCESS AND RESPONSIBILITY, AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS. AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AND ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE, AS WELL AS YOURSELF, I HAVE ABSOLUTE FAITH THAT WE CAN DELIVER THE SOLUTION AND PROTECT CHILDREN ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE JUST HEARD REALLY REINFORCES HOW NOBODY KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO TRY AND MAKE ANY OF US, BUT PARTICULARLY OUR CHILDREN, SAFE. THAT'S WHAT BEHIND THE PROPOSALS I'M MAKING. THEY ARE NOT NEW. THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THEM, OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I AM SO DETERMINED WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO GET THIS DONE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. WE HAVE A BIG GROUP FROM MOMS DEMAND ACTION, AND FROM DAD'S AS WELL. I WANT TO COMMEND THEM. THEY ARE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION THAT IS REALLY TRYING TO BRING THESE ISSUES TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION. WE NEED MORE OF THAT. I HAVE SAID WE NEED A MOVEMENT, THAT PEOPLE REALLY WILL BE PART OF, NO MATTER WHAT OTHER ISSUES THAT IS ON YOUR MIND, THAT YOU CARE ABOUT -- OUR SAFETY. THE GREAT HOPE THAT WE CAN PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY BUSINESS SHOULD BE AT THE TOP. AND THEREFORE, I'M REALLY ASKING EVERYBODY, REGARDLESS OF POLITICS OR PARTISANSHIP OR CANDIDATES OR ANYTHING ELSE TO THINK OF THE WAYS THAT EACH OF US CAN DO MORE TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT MEASURE OF GUN SAFETY THAT WILL SAVE LIVES AND PREVENT VIOLENCE. LET ME START BY ASKING PEOPLE, IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAVE A COMMENT TO MAKE ON THIS, OR ANY ISSUE, I WOULD LIKE TO START THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE AND I WANT TO BE SURE TO HEAR FROM THEM. FORMER CONGRESSMAN DIX SWEAT, HELLO. >> IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE, ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE WITH MY GOOD FRIENDS THE CLINTONS. I WANT TO GIVE EVERYONE A BACKGROUND ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REGARDS TO GUNS. IN 1994, I VOTED IN FAVOR OF A CRIME BILL THAT HAD IN IT AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN FOR 17 ASSAULT WEAPONS OUT OF NEARLY 800 WEAPONS THAT WERE ON THE STREET. [APPLAUSE] >> I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANY ATTENTION, BUT I RECEIVED A LETTER PRIOR TO THE VOTE THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE WORTH SHARING WITH THE PEOPLE HERE. I SHARED IT WITH HILLARY EARLIER. IT IS A LETTER FROM RONALD REAGAN, AND IT IS DATED MAY 5, 1994, AND IT'S WRITTEN TO CONGRESSMAN DIX SWEAT. HE WRITES -- HERE'S A COPY OF THE LETTER. I'M READING OFF OF HIS OWN HANDWRITING. "" FRED RYAN TOLD ME OF YOUR CONVERSATION, AND I KNOW YOU WERE THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BILL. AS A LONGTIME GUN OWNER AND SUPPORTER OF THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, I TOO HAVE CAREFULLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I'M CONVINCED THAT THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED IN THIS BILL ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. I KNOW THERE'S A HEAVY PRESSURE ON YOU TO GO THE OTHER WAY. BUT I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL. IT MUST BE PASSED. SINCERELY, RONALD REAGAN. "" [APPLAUSE] >> I'VE WATCHED HILLARY AND HER HUSBAND BILL WORKED WITH PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. SHE IS GOING TO BE A LEADER WHO WILL MAKE THIS PROBLEM ULTIMATELY, GO AWAY. I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT AS OUR PRESIDENT, HILLARY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM THAT WE BEGAN TRYING TO TACKLE BACK IN THE 1990'S. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU IN THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, THAT'S FOR SURE. THIS GENTLEMAN IN THE GREEN SHIRT. TO >> THANK YOU. WE ARE ALL THE WAY FROM ARIZONA, I GREW UP IN TUCSON, ARIZONA. I AM A GUN OWNER AND THE SUPPORT OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. ESPECIALLY WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AS YOU KNOW, IN TUCSON, WE HAD A PERSON WHO HAD ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE AND WAS ABLE TO BUY A GUN, AS YOU SAID, VIRGINIA TECH, LOUISIANA, THAT PERSON HAD BEEN COMMITTED. AUTO FROM A GUN OWNER, FROM A RED STATE, AND A PERSON WHO OWNS GUNS, MORE POWER TO YOU. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. YES, THE LADY RIGHT HERE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE. >> THANKS FOR PICKING ON ME. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE CDC, AND RESEARCH THAT WAS CUT OFF EARLY IN THE 90'S BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I THINK THAT IF YOU CAN BRING THAT BACK, IF WE COULD CONVINCE LEGISLATURE TO FUND RESEARCH INTO GUN VIOLENCE, WHAT CAUSES IT -- I THINK WE'RE HITTING A LOT OF MARKS WITH THAT BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, WE ARE GETTING WHAT ROLE GUNS PLAY, HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE CAN OFF SOMEONE WITH A GUN WHEN THEY WANT TO. IF WE CAN JUST ANALYZE THAT DATA, I THINK WE WILL BE A LOT BETTER PLACE. HILLARY CLINTON: I AGREE WITH YOU. WHAT SHE IS REFERRING TO IS THAT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING AT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. IF THERE IS DIRTY WATER THAT IS MAKING PEOPLE SICK, WE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO TELL US WHAT TO DO TO PREVENT THAT. SO, THEY WERE RESEARCHING GUN AND VIOLENCE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT'S VIOLENCE? WHAT KINDS OF WARNING SIGNS MIGHT THERE BE? AND FOR VERY SAD REASONS, BASICALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT. THE REPUBLICANS STOPPED THE RESEARCH. IT EVEN GOES FURTHER THAN THAT. THERE IS A LAW IN FLORIDA -- I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS BECAUSE IT WAS SO SHOCKING AT FIRST THAT I REALLY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. THERE IS A LAW IN FLORIDA THAT MAKES IT A FELONY FOR A PEDIATRICIAN TO TALK WITH FAMILIES ABOUT BEING SURE THEY KEEP GUNS SAFELY AWAY FROM CHILDREN. LITERALLY, A DOCTOR CAN GO TO JAIL IN FLORIDA. IF YOU ARE A PEDIATRICIAN, AND YOU ARE RUNNING THROUGH CHECKLISTS, ARE YOU KEEPING THE HOUSEHOLD POISONS OUT OF THE WAVE YOUR KIDS? ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE TODDLERS EXPLORING EVERYTHING. YOU MAKE SURE YOUR SHARP KNIVES ARE KEPT AWAY, ARE THEY HIGH ENOUGH UP SO KIDS CAN'T ACCIDENTALLY GET THEM? IT SEEMS PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO ME TO SAY IF YOU HAVE GUNS IN THE HOUSE, ARE YOU SURE THEY ARE REALLY SECURE? BECAUSE TOO MANY LITTLE KIDS GET A HOLD OF THEM. WE READ ABOUT IT EVERY WEEK. THEY KILL THEMSELVES, THEY KILL THEIR FRIENDS. I THINK IT IS A DOCTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE FAMILY SO THAT THE FAMILY CAN TRY AND KEEP THEIR BABIES SAFE. IF YOU ARE IN FLORIDA, YOU COULD GO TO JAIL. I WANT TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT AND YOU WILL WORK TOWARDS THE AND WILL WORK TOWARDS THE RESULTS THAT WE CAN LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE GUNS? IN YOUR AS WE WERE JUST HEARING YOU R-ARIZONA AND OR FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM ARIZONA, AS WE AND YOU ARE GENTLEMAN FROM ARIZONA, AS WE ARE LEARNING YOU MORE, CERTAINLY WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE KILLER FROM SANDY HOOK, NOW THE KILLER FROM WILL AND OREGON, THERE PROBABLY WERE SOME COMMENTS, SOME ACTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE SET OFF SOME WILL ALARMS AND PEOPLE. AND YOU IN PEOPLE -- IN PEOPLE. BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE GOOD INFORMATION SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE BETTER INFORMED, HOW DO WE HELP THEM? I AGREE WITH YOU. NO ISSUE SHOULD BE BEYOND STUDY IN AMERICA. THAT'S LIKE A DENIAL OF EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: GOING ALONG WITH THAT, SO FAR AS I KNOW, THE GUN INDUSTRY AND GUN SELLERS ARE THE ONLY BUSINESS IN AMERICA THAT IS TOTALLY FREE OF LIABILITY FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR. NOBODY ELSE IS GIVEN THAT IMMUNITY. AND THAT JUST ILLUSTRATES THE EXTREMISM THAT HAS TAKEN OVER THIS DEBATE. I WAS REALLY STRUCK WHEN HE WAS READING THE LETTER FROM RONALD IN REAGAN. AND THE FACT THAT WHEN HE WAS FACING A VERY HARD CHOICE, WHICH MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE COST HIM HIS SEAT IN CONGRESS, BECAUSE HE WILL VOTED FOR THE CRIME BILL WHICH CONTAINED THE BRADY BILL, WHICH LED TO THE BACKGROUND CHECKS, WHICH LED TO MORE THAN 2 MILLION PEOPLE NOT GETTING GUNS WHO WERE FELONS OR DOMESTIC ABUSERS, OR OTHERWISE INELIGIBLE -- HE PAID A BIG PRICE FOR THAT. AND HERE'S A LETTER FROM RONALD REAGAN. IN WHEN THE NRA WAS ON ONE OF AN THEIR TIRADES, CALLING THE IS AN ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND WILL ARE YOU AS YOU YOU ARE FIREARMS ENFORCERS JACKBOOTED YOU THUGS, PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. AND BUSH RESIGNED AS AN NRA WILL MEMBER AND SAID NO, I'M NOT GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: IDEALLY, WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IS GUN OWNERS, RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS, FORM A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION AND TAKE BACK THE SECOND AMENDMENT FROM THESE EXTREMISTS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: OK. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. THIS LADY RIGHT THERE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE. >> I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU, MRS. YOU CLINTON. I KNOW THIS IS A BIG ISSUE IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT I'M FROM YOU THE UNITED STATES, BUT I'M FROM AFGHANISTAN. I'M THINKING ABOUT MY COUNTRY, EVERY DAY, MORE THAN 200 OR 300 PEOPLE DIED OVER THERE. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR OPINION AFTER YOU BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DO YOU WANT TO PULL OUT ALL UNITED STATES SOLDIERS OR ARE YOU THINKING THEY ARE GOING TO STAY THERE? HER WE WANTED THEM TO STAY THERE FOR AFGHANISTAN, FOR PROTECTION. WILL FOR AFGHANISTAN, FOR PROTECTION. AND YOU AND I WILL I WANT TO I WILL I WANT TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THAT. AND IN THANK YOU. AND HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. FIRST, I WANT TO SAY HOW DISTRESSED I AM BY THE BOMBING OF THE HOSPITAL. IN AND I KNOW THAT DEFENSE IN SECRETARY CARTER HAS SAID HER THERE WILL BE A FULL THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO TRY AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. BUT IT IS DEEPLY REGRETTABLE. IT CAME WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AND THE TALIBAN TAKING BACK OVER YOU GO A CITY IN THE NORTH, AND TO THE DOOR THE AFGHAN ARMY, AND HE THE AFGHAN ARMY, WHICH HAS PERFORMED VERY BRAVELY -- HAS PERFORMED VERY BRAVELY --AND THIS IS NOT AN ARMY THE RUNS I AND AWAY. THIS IS AN ARMY THAT STANDS IN YOU WILL A LOT OF -- AND FIGHTS. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE, THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY ARE TRYING TO BE. I THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE AFGHAN MILITARY TO SUPPORT THEM. BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING. IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, BUT THEY'RE IN AFGHANISTAN, PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE LAST 13, 14 YEARS. THERE STILL IS A LOT OF CONFLICT, THERE STILL IS A LOT OF DANGER. BUT TALIBAN IS NOT GOING AWAY. WE KNOW THAT. BUT THERE HAS BEEN SO MANY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS. NUMBER THE NUMBER OF GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SCHOOL, AT WORK, STUDYING IN THE UNITED STATES, GOING HOME TO TRY AND HELP THEIR COUNTRY, BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOW ABLE TO OPERATE NOW AS OPPOSED TO BEING UNDER THE SUM AND FOR THE -- UNDER THE THUMB OF THE TALIBAN AND BEING FORCED TO BASICALLY PAY TRIBUTE ALL THE TIME TO THE TALIBAN -- OR HAVE BEEN A LOT OF ADVANCES IN HEALTH. AFGHANISTAN HAD THE WORST MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IN THE WORLD, AND THINGS TO HELP FOR NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES, BUT OTHER COUNTRIES, WORKING WITH AFGHAN DOCTORS AND NURSES, MOTHERS ARE SURVIVING AND CHILDBIRTH. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE SO BASIC, THAT ARE NOW SO MUCH BETTER IN AFGHANISTAN. I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT I WILL BE FACING IN JANUARY OF 2017. BUT AFGHANISTAN IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS TRIED. AND THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING BEYOND THE VIOLENCE IN THE EXTREMISM FROM THE TALIBAN. AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD JUST WALK AWAY. I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE. >> MY NAME IS JEANNIE, I WAS BORN ON BELMONT STREET RIGHT HERE IN TOWN. IT IS NO LONGER THE CITY I WAS RAISED IN. A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF DRUGS, AND BECAUSE OF GUN VIOLENCE. IN MY QUESTION TO YOU, HILLARY, AND IN IF I CAN CALL YOU THAT -- HILLARY CLINTON: OR YOU CAN AHILLARY CLINTON: OR YOU CAN CALL ME VAL. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] >> OR VAL. MY QUESTION IS, LAST WEEK A REPORTER ASKED DR. BEN CARSON ONE QUESTION. THAT QUESTION WAS, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN ADVANCE TO ASSIST THE FOLKS OF A HORRIBLE EVENTS LIKE LETTER HURRICANE JOAQUIN. HE KEPT A VERY SHORT AND TO THINK OR DO -- SUCCINCT AND HIS THREE WORD ANSWER WAS -- I DON'T KNOW. ALONG WITH THAT, AS YOU SAID LAST WEEK, A REPORTER ASKED JEB BUSH WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN ORDER ON -- IN ORGAN -- IN OREGON. HIS RESPONSE TO THAT HORRIFIC TRAGEDY WAS STUFF HAPPENS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU -- YOU EXPLAIN TO THIS AUDIENCE AND TO THE NATION, WHY THOSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN YOUR RESPONSES, AND WHY, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU ARE READY TO LEAD FROM DAY ONE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: LET'S TAKE THE NATURAL DISASTER QUESTION FIRST. BECAUSE HURRICANE JOAQUIN WAS ON EVERYONE'S MIND. THANKFULLY, IT DIDN'T HIT AS HARD AS THEY FEARED, ALTHOUGH SOUTH CAROLINA IS GETTING BATTERED WITH TERRIBLE TORRENTIAL RAIN. I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS ANY NEW PRESIDENT HAS IS WHO IS GOING TO RUN FEMA, AND WHO IS GOING TO BE PREPARED TO WORK WITH CITIES, STATES, AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO GET PREPARED FOR INCOMING NATURAL DISASTERS, TO AND GET PRE-POSITIONED THE EQUIPMENTS AND THE FOOD AND THE EXPERTS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE. I WILL TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS REAL, HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE, NOT FROM 30,000 FEET FLYING OVER IT, VERY WILL BUT WHO HAS BEEN THERE, WHO IS HAD TO GO IN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO TO HELP AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO TO HELP PEOPLE EVACUATE, WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO TRY TO DO I AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO HELP WILL PEOPLE SAVE THEIR HOMES, BUT NOT STAY IN THEIR HOMES. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF HARD-WON ARE WISDOM. IN BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WE YOUR ARE SEEING AN INCREASED NUMBER OF WEATHER EVENTS. WILL ALL OVER THE WORLD, NOT JUST IN OUR COUNTRY. WE NEED A MAPPING PROJECT. AND WILL AND I WILL GIVE YOU A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY I WILL DISAGREE SO PROFOUNDLY WITH THE CURRENT REPUBLICANS, WE'VE HEARD THE LETTER FROM RONALD WILL YOU AND REAGAN, I TOLD YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH. THE CURRENT REPUBLICANS IN THE I CONGRESS ARE TRYING TO CUT DRAMATICALLY THE MONEY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS IN TO WEATHER FORECASTING. TO ME, THAT IS SO PENNY WISE, AND POUND FOOLISH. A WIDE WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE WEATHER FORECASTING. NOT ONLY FOR AGRICULTURE AND YOU WILL KNOW, EVERYDAY OCCURRENCES, BUT ALSO TO GET AHEAD OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND EVENTS LIKE BIG STORMS. AND YOU ARE MORE THAN I WILL A I WILL WILL APPOINT GOOD PEOPLE, I WILL LOOK ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER SO THAT WE HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION WITH STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE WELL-INFORMED, SO THEY CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. AND THAT WE MOVE REALLY QUICKLY TO COME IN AFTER SOMETHING'S OR HAPPENED, BECAUSE WE CAN'T WILL YOU AND THEIR STOP THE WEATHER, WE KNOW THAT. BUT TO BE REALLY READY TO GET IN THERE TO HELP THE CLEANUP AND THE RECOVERY. I THINK THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE EMPOWERED TO HELP THEMSELVES TO. I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT ARE A SOMETIMES THE FEDERAL YOU AND GOVERNMENT HAS THE YOU MESSAGE OF DON'T DO ANYTHING WILL MESSAGE OF DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE GET THERE. THAT'S NOT MY MESSAGE. HELP EACH OTHER, HELP FIX THE YOU AND PROBLEM, HELP WORK, TAKE PICTURES AND REPORT THINGS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEN THEY SAY I WANT TO GET SOME HELP FROM THE DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDING, THEY ARE TOLD WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT IT ALONE. NO, YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT ALONE. SHOULD BE OUT THERE HELPING YOUR NEIGHBORS. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS A CELL PHONE. KEEP A RECORD OF IT SO WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, FEMA, SMALL BUSINESS A ADMINISTRATION, WILL OTHERS SHOW UP YOU CAN SAY HERE IS WHAT WE HAD RIGHT AFTER THE STORM, HERE IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING TO CLEAN UP. HERE'S WHAT WE SPENT ON WHY IS ON YOUR -- WHAT WE SPEND ON PLYWOOD AND BOARDING, AND THE BIG VACUUMS TO CLEAN UP THE DIRT. I'M VERY HANDS-ON, VERY PRACTICAL, VERY LET'S GET IT DONE. THAT'S HOW I VIEW THAT. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: ALL MY GOODNESS. THIS YOUNG LADY RIGHT THERE. >> THANK YOU. I WAS GOING TO SAY, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WEATHER. [LAUGHTER] BY THE TIME I GO TO COLLEGE, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE UNITED STATES TO BE LIKE? HILLARY CLINTON: THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. CAN I ASK YOU HOW OLD YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? >> 10 YEARS OLD. HILLARY CLINTON: SO I HAVE A LITTLE TIME, BUT NOT A LOT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: FIRST OF ALL, I WANTED TO TRULY BE THE COUNTRY WE ALL LOVE AND CHERISH. AND HAS GIVEN SO MUCH TO EVERYONE OF US WHO IS HERE IN THIS ROOM TODAY. THAT STILL HOLDS OUT THAT SAME PROMISE TO YOU, BUT IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD, AND STAY AHEAD, AND PURSUE YOUR DREAMS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT MEANS WE GOT TO GET THE ECONOMY WORKING BETTER SO IT IT PRODUCES MORE JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES, AND I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT. BUT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PART OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS. I WANT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM -- IS THAT LIKE IT'S WORKING PRETTY WELL FOR YOU. I WANTED TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY. AND PARTICULARLY, STARTING WITH OUR YOUNGEST KIDS TO GET THEM OFF TO A BETTER START SO THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. AND I WANT COLLEGE TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR YOU, SO WE GOT TO GET THE COST DOWN. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I HAVE OUTLINED WHAT I CALL THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT TO DO JUST THAT. I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH AMBITION, TALENTS, A GOOD WORK ETHIC, NOT BE ABLE START SCHOOL OR FINISH SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT, AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THE COST DOWN SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T GO INTO DEBT. I AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE HAVE TO REFINANCE THE DEATH OF PEOPLE HAVE SO THEY CAN BE MORE FREE TO PURSUE THEIR OWN INTERESTS, AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY MOVE OUT OF THEIR PARENTS HOMES AND MAYBE RENT OR BUY ONE. AND GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES. WITH HEALTH CARE, I WANT US TO HAVE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE, SO THEY HAVE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. I WANT US TO DEAL WITH THE BIG SUBSTANCE ABUSE EPIDEMIC, SO THAT WE BEGIN TO TURN THE TIDE ON HEROIN AND PILLS, AND OTHER ADDICTIONS THAT ARE RUINING PEOPLES LIVES. AND GOING BACK TO THE GUN DISCUSSION, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE MORE TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP MORE PEOPLE GET THE TREATMENT, ASSUMING IT IS AVAILABLE. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I WANT THE WORLD TO BE SAFER, I WANT THE WORLD THAT YOU WILL BECOME AN ADULT IN THE STILL BE LED BY THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. THE UNITED STATES, IF WE DON'T LEAD, NOBODY LEADS. WE HAVE A VACUUM. THE VACUUM IS FILLED BY A LOT OF BAD ACTORS, INCLUDING TERRORIST GROUPS WHO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AND EVENTUALLY EVEN THREATEN US. AND I WANT TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS, OUR CIVIL RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS. I WANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I CAN'T POSSIBLY, EVEN AS PRESIDENT, DO ALL OF THAT. IT HAS TO BE DONE BY EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER. EVERYBODY STANDING UP FOR THE KIND OF COUNTRY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE IN, THAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR OUR CHILDREN. I'M A GRANDMOTHER, AS MAYBE YOU KNOW. I WILL JUST SAY THIS. I AM THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER. MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS GRAND LEASE MEALS -- MILLS, AND HE DID IT TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY AND SO HIS SONS OF HAVE A BETTER LIFE. AND THEY DID. ALL THREE OF HIS SONS ENDED UP GOING TO COLLEGE. MY DAD STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS. IT WAS REALLY SMALL, BUT IT PROVIDED A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE FOR US. HERE I AM, THIRD-GENERATION, ASKING ALL OF YOU TO ELECT A PRESIDENT. THAT IS THE AMERICAN STORY. I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN, AS WILL MY HUSBAND, TO HELP OUR GRANDDAUGHTER HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE LIFE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT OR SECRETARY OF STATE TO BELIEVE YOU CAN FULFILL YOUR DREAMS IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE THE AND GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER OR THE GRANDSON OF A TRUCK DRIVER AND HAVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. SO EVERY SINGLE DAY, I'M GOING TO WAKE UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND I'M GOING TO SAY TO MYSELF, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TODAY TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THAT IS MY MISSION AS PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: SO MANY HANDS. RIGHT THERE. I WILL GIVE YOU MY MICROPHONE. >> GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION. YOU ARE RIGHT. EVERY DAY OR EVERY WEEK WE'RE HEARING ABOUT CHILDREN DYING ON THE STREETS OR IN THEIR SCHOOLS AT THE HANDS OF STRANGERS WITH GUNS. WE ARE ALSO HEARING ABOUT CHILDREN DYING IN THEIR HOMES BY THE HANDS OF THEIR CAREGIVERS. WE ARE SEEING CHILD POVERTY CONTINUED TO INCREASE AS CHILDREN SLEPT THROUGH THE SHREDDED SAFETY NET. AND WE'RE HEARING FROM COLLEGE PROFESSORS AND EMPLOYERS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THEM NOT READY TO LEARN OR PREPARED FOR 20% THREE JOBS. -- FOUR 21ST CENTURY JOBS. AS PRESIDENT, WHAT POLICIES WOULD YOU LOOK TO MOVE FORWARD IN YOUR FIRST 100 DAYS TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN, AND PREPARE THEM FOR THEIR FUTURE? HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU. SADLY, HER QUESTION REALLY POINTS TO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, WHERE OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION, BECAUSE OF THE HUGE LOSS OF JOBS AND WEALTH THAT PEOPLE HAD BUILT UP BEFORE 2007, 2008, POVERTY IS ON THE INCREASE. TODAY, 51% OF THE CHILDREN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LOW OR REDUCED COST OR FREE LUNCHES. AND WE WERE ON A GOOD PASS, MAY -- WE WERE ON A GOOD PATH, MAY I SAY, IN THE 90. -- 90'S. WE WERE ON A GOOD PASS TO LIFT MORE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, AND BY LIFTING FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY, YOU HELPED TO LIFT CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS, DO ALL OF THAT AGAIN. I GIVE PRESIDENT OBAMA ENORMOUS CREDIT FOR TAKING US OUT OF A DEEP DITCH THAT HE WAS IN WHEN THE REPUBLICANS LEFT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. THE TOP OF THE LIST IS MORE JOBS, RAISE THEM IN WAGE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL TIME ARE -- RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE SO PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL-TIME ARE NOT STILL LIVING IN POVERTY, AND THEY CAN PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. MORE JOBS IN GENERAL, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT PROJECTS, WE HAVE A LOT OF ROADS AND BRIDGES AND RAIL TRACK AND AIRPORTS AND PORTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT IS DETERIORATING, ENTITIES TO BE BUILT UP, YOU -- AND IT NEEDS TO BE BUILT UP, MAINTAINED, SO WE ARE MORE COMPETITIVE ECONOMICALLY. THAT WOULD PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO WORK. AND I THINK WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY MORE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS, WHICH WOULD BE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND BUSINESSES, IF WE SHIFTED THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE STILL IN THE TAX CODE AND OTHER PARTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT FOR FOSSIL FUELS TO WIND AND SOLAR AND ADVANCED BIOFUELS, WE WOULD BE A HEAD ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE FRONT, AND WE WOULD BE PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK, AND WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THAT IN SOME PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY. WE JUST NEED TO DO IT ALL THE WAY ACROSS. I THINK PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR CORPORATIONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE IN THE PROFITS, NOT JUST THE CEOS, BUT EVERYBODY. UP AND DOWN THE LINE IN THOSE COMPANIES. VERY MUCH LIKE MARKET BASKET, PLACE YOU ALL KNOW, BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE PROFIT-SHARING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS, WHICH CREATES 60% OF THE JOBS IN AMERICA. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE BEHIND IN SMALL BUSINESS CREATION AND GROWTH. WE USED TO BE NUMBER ONE, WE ARE NOW NOT EVEN IN THE TOP 10. I WANT TO DO MORE AND MORE CREDIT, GET RID OF REGULATIONS AND LICENSING IN THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO START THEIR BUSINESS, LIKE MY DAD DID. AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. AND ONCE WE GET THE ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN, THEN WE CAN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO HOW WE CAN BE GOOD PARTNERS WITH FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE AT HERE ARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS, AND I HAVE WORKED IN THIS AREA FOR A VERY LONG TIME. FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE HAVE TO KEEP THEM SAFE. AND FREE FROM VIOLENCE BY STRANGERS OR THOSE WITHIN THEIR OWN HOMES AND FAMILIES. WE ALSO NEED TO HELP KIDS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MANY OF OUR KIDS, AND MY GRANDCHILD HAS TO GET AHEAD, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: IT'S NOT JUST A NICE THING TO DO, IF YOU DON'T PREPARE KIDS IN THEIR FIRST FIVE YEARS, WHEN THEY GET TO SCHOOL, THEY WILL BE BEHIND. THERE WILL BE AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THEN IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THE KID IN THE FAMILY OF THE SCHOOL TO CLOSE THAT GAP. I HAPPEN TO THINK TALENT IS EVERYWHERE. BUT I DON'T THINK OPPORTUNITY IS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOSING BECAUSE WE HAVE POOR KIDS WHO ARE NOT GIVEN A CHANCE TO REALLY GET OFF TO A GOOD START, WHOSE BRAINS ARE NOT BEING STIMULATED THIN -- IN THE WAY THAT WILL HELP THEM GET A VOCABULARY SO THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. I THINK THE EARLY CHILDHOOD PEACE OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. HEALTH CARE IS ESSENTIAL. I HELPED START THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM BACK IN THE 90'S TO TAKE CARE OF 8 MILLION KIDS. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: AND THAT'S WHY I FIND STATES THAT DON'T WANT TO EXPAND MEDICAID TO BE REALLY MISSING THE BOAT. WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE HEALTHY. HOW CAN WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE ECONOMY IF THEY CAN'T GET THEIR BASIC HEALTH NEEDS MET? THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR KIDS. MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WAS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. WE WOULD GO INTO AREAS IN THE SCHOOLS AND KIDS COULDN'T SEE, WE STOPPED HAVING SCHOOL NURSES, WE STOPPED TESTING THEIR EYESIGHT. I FOUND OUT THAT I COULDN'T SEE IN FOURTH-GRADE. BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW I COULDN'T SEE VERY MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME TO FIND OUT, BUT I THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS A BIG IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING. I JUST GOT UP REALLY CLOSE TO THE TV SET. THEN WE HAD AND I EXAMINE SCHOOL -- THEN WE HAD AN EYE EXAM IN SCHOOL AND I FOUND OUT I REALLY CAN'T SEE. THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS THAT ARE NOT GETTING THOSE BASIC HEALTH NEEDS MET. THAT ALSO HOLDS THEM BACK. AND THEN OF COURSE, ONCE WE ARE IN SCHOOL, I THINK WE SHOULD START RESPECTING TEACHERS AGAIN WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THE KIDS, AND TRY TO HELP THEM HELP THE CHILDREN. I LITERALLY COULD GO ON ALL DAY. I WILL JUST SAY ONE MORE THING. WE NOW HAVE A HUNGER PROBLEM AGAIN. A LOT OF US THOUGHT THAT WAS BEHIND US. WE HAVE BOTH A HUNGER AND A NUTRITION PROBLEM. WE HAVE MAYBE NOT THE KIND OF HUNGER THAT TURNS PEOPLE INTO WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY PHYSICAL MALNUTRITION. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE NUTRITION IN A LOT OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES, AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST FEED THEIR KIDS, BECAUSE WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD IS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR THEIR KIDS. BUT IT'S AFFORDABLE. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK ON THIS TO GET BACK TO WHERE THERE ISN'T THAT SENSE OF EITHER HUNGER OR POOR NUTRITION I CAN REALLY AFFECT A CHILD'S DEVELOPED. THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT, BUT I WOULD ASK EVERYBODY TO HELP ME DO, BECAUSE THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE IN EVERY COMMUNITY, INCLUDING MANCHESTER. THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BLUE SHIRT. [APPLAUSE] >> HELLO. I GUESS I'M WONDERING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY? THIS COME UP SO MUCH WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO VARIOUS SHOOTINGS -- JUST THE GENERAL STATE OF OUR LACK OF FUNDING FOR ALL OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS OUT THERE. I THINK THIS ALL HAPPENED AFTER WE DE-INSTITUTIONALIZED MENTAL HEALTH, AND WE HAD A PROMISE TO FUND IT, BUT WE NEVER DID. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE THAT? HILLARY CLINTON: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. SOME OF YOU ARE MEMBER THAT. -- SOME OF YOU REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? BACK IN THE 1980'S, WE HAD A LOT OF DEBATE OVER BIG INSTITUTIONS, WHERE PEOPLE WERE HOUSED, BUT IN MANY CASES, THEY WERE WAREHOUSED. AND THE RESULTS OF A LOT OF INVESTIGATIONS WHICH SHOWED HOW PEOPLE WERE NOT BE ADEQUATELY CARED FOR WAS TO SHUT DOWN A LOT OF THE INSTITUTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO PEOPLE IF THERE WERE NO PLACE FOR THEM WERE GUARANTEED WE WOULD HAVE FUNDING AND TIMIDITY ALTERNATIVES FOR MENTAL HEALTH. SO WE SHUT DOWN THE INSTITUTIONS, BY AND LARGE, AND WE NEVER REALLY INVESTED WHAT WE SHOULD IN MENTAL HEALTH ALTERNATIVES. THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT I PUSH VERY HARD. AS YOU MENTIONED GUN VIOLENCE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS OFTEN DIRECTLY RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE ADDICTION ISSUE, A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE SELF-MEDICATING WITH ALCOHOL AND DRUGS. SO THAN THEY HAVE A DUAL PROBLEM THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE A AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE, THAT PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CAN GET TREATMENT. THE RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, A LOT OF STATES, A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE NOT PROVIDING THE KIND OF SUPPORT YOU NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH. WHEN SOMEBODY IS EITHER CONVINCED, OR DECIDES TO SEEK MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, THEY VERY OFTEN ARE TOLD WE HAVE NO PLACE FOR YOU, COME BACK IN SIX WEEKS OR THREE MONTHS, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. YOU KNOW WHERE MOST PEOPLE NOW WHO ARE PRESENTING WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS SHOW UP? THEY ARE IN OUR JAILS IN OUR PRISONS. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE HARM TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS. THEY OFTEN ACT OUT IN A WAY THAT DRAWS ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IN MOST PLACES IN THE COUNTRY, THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO, SO THEY ARE PUT IN JAIL. AND THEY MAY BE HELD THERE FOR A LONG TIME. WITHOUT ANY TREATMENT, AND IN THE END OF IN PRISON, THEY ARE STILL NOT GETTING ADEQUATE TREATMENTS. THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS, BECAUSE WE HAVE OVER PRESCRIBED PAINKILLERS, THE OPIOIDS WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN VERY ADDICTED TO THEM. AND THAT CREATES A MENTAL STRAIN ON TOP OF WHATEVER OTHER PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT HAVE. AND SO WE NOW HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO TRY AND WITHDRAW. AND WE HAVE ABOUT 23 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED IN AMERICA. SO WHEN THEY GO FOR HELP, ONLY ONE IN 10 CAN GET IT. SEE YOU GOT THIS REAL DOUBLE WHAMMY, PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE GETTING -- ARE NOT GETTING HELP, PEOPLE WITH ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS ARE NOT GETTING HELP, AND YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE TAKE RESOURCES AND TREAT BOTH PEOPLE SIMULTANEOUSLY, BECAUSE TOO OFTEN, THEY BECOME INTERCONNECTED. AND THEN WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. I PLEDGE TO YOU, I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN, MORE FACILITIES, MORE TRAINED PEOPLE, MORE INSURANCE COVERAGE, MORE REVENUES. YOU CAN CALL ON SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW EVERYBODY. [LAUGHTER] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT, AND ATTENTION. HE TOLD ME WE ONLY HAVE TIME FOR MORE QUESTION. >> A MAN WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO HEAR, HIS NAME IS SANDERS, I THINK. HE HAS AN IDEA ABOUT SENDING KIDS TO COLLEGE FOR FREE, AS HE THINKS THEY DO IN EUROPE. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY FREE, BUT YOU HAVE A PLAN THAT WOULD SORT OF MAKE HIM BACK DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON THIS? HILLARY CLINTON: I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF. HE IS CLEARLY MORE THAN CAPABLE OF SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEBATE IN ABOUT EIGHT DAYS, SO WE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO CONTRAST. BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE, AND I THINK EVERYBODY IS, HOW WE GET COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE, AND HOW WE REFINANCE STUDENT DEBT -- GO TO MY WEBSITE, HILLARY CLINTON.COM. IT'S CALLED THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT, BUT VERY BRIEFLY, I DO HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. FIRST OF ALL, MY APPROACH IS BEEN, THANKFULLY, ENDORSED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IT ADDRESSES MANY ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM. FIRST, WE'VE GOT TO GET THE COST OF COLLEGE DOWN. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO QUIT RAISING TUITION AND COSTS ON STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. IF ALL WE DO IS TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE, BUT WE DON'T REALLY PUT PRESSURE ON THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO LOWER THE COST, YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE COSTS GOING UP, AND THEN THE COST OF THE QUOTE FREE COLLEGE WILL GO UP. THAT TO ME IS UNSUSTAINABLE. FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LOOKING AT, AND ADMINISTRATORS THEY NEED, HOW MANY BUILDINGS THEY NEED, CONNIE DIFFERENT COURSES ARE NO LONGER REALLY RELEVANT. LET'S TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING ON CAMPUS. YET THOSE COSTS DOWN SO WE CAN KEEP TUITION DOWN. SECONDLY, I HAVE SAID THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- I HAVE A PLAN, $350 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. ABOUT $35 BILLION A YEAR, WHERE WE WOULD MATCH FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE STATE WOULD PUT IN TO MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THEIR STUDENTS, WE WOULD MATCH THEM FOR TO ONE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO AGREE ON SOME OF THESE CHANGES THE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO GET THE MONEY. AND THEN, IF YOU CHOOSE A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, I WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GO WITHOUT BORROWING MONEY FOR TUITION, BUT I WILL EXPECT SOMETHING FROM YOU. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, 10 HOURS OF WORK WEEK. I WORKED WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, I WORKED WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VALUE. AND YES, YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT. BUT IT WILL BE FOR A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, POSSIBLE TO NOT BORROW MONEY FOR TUITION. FOR LIVING EXPENSES, I WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE PELL GRANTS TO BE USED FOR LIVING EXPENSES. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GET A PELL GRANT, THEY OFTEN FIND IT DOESN'T EVEN COVER TUITION ANYMORE. SO WE WILL DEAL WITH THE TUITION SIDE ON THE PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY. AND THEN WE WILL DEAL WITH THE LIVING EXPENSE SIDE. IF YOU DO HAVE TO BORROW MONEY, IT WILL BE WITH A LOW INTEREST RATE. AND I WILL FORGIVE LOANS TO PEOPLE WHO DO PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME -- [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: SO -- I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I DON'T THINK COLLEGE SHOULD BE FREE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CHILDREN. I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL OFF SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR COLLEGE. I'M INTERESTED IN THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND WORKING PEOPLE, AND POOR KIDS WHO DESERVE TO HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT GOING TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATING. [APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON: I FEEL STRONGLY THAT, WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE TO -- WHO HAS STUDENT DEBT STILL? OH, YEAH. WE HAVE 40 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA WAS DOING DEBT. WHAT I WANT IS TO REFINANCE ALL THE STUDENT DEBT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IF YOU HAVE A HOME MORTGAGE, OR YOU'RE MAKING CAR PAYMENTS, YOU CAN REFINANCE IT. WE FOR BID YOU FROM REFINANCING STUDENT DEBT. AND AT THE EVENT I DID EARLIER IN HOLLAND, A YOUNG WOMAN WAY IN THE BACK WHO SAID HER JUST RATE IS 12%. I WANT US TO REFINANCE IT, I WANT TO PROVIDE EVERYBODY THE CHANCE TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. IF YOU ARE A FIREFIGHTER OR SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, OR SOCIAL WORKER, OR A POLICE OFFICER -- WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING THAT YOU WANT TO DO, BUT YOU ARE NOT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY BACK AT THAT HIGH INTEREST RATE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK AT ABOUT 10% OF YOUR INCOME. WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, I DIDN'T GO TO A BIG LAW FIRM, I WENT TO WORK FOR A NONPROFIT BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK ON BEHALF OF KIDS. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH THAT THE UNIVERSITY AT THAT TIME OFFERED ME THE CHANCE TO PAY IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE. BOTH BILL AND I HAD LOANS, AND HE WAS A LAW PROFESSOR AND I BECAME A LAW PROFESSOR. WE WERE MAKING $14,000, $17,000 A YEAR. WE WERE PAYING BACK OUR LOANS BY WHAT WE CAN AFFORD. I WANT THIS TO BE, AS I SAY, A COMPACT. WHERE PEOPLE DO THEIR PART, OBVIOUSLY, YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO DO THEIR PART, FAMILIES HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO. COLLEGES HAVE TO PITCH IN AND GET THE COSTS DOWN. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PARTNER WITH STATES. WE'VE HAD THIS EXAMPLE OF MEDICAID. IF THE STATE SAYS NO, WE DON'T WANT TO PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEN I WILL WRITE INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS ONE. I DO WANT TO ME TO COLLEGES TO -- I DO WANT COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE AS INEXPENSIVE AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

THE FLORIDA SENATOR SPOKE IN NEW YORK CITY TODAY TO MEMBERS OF THE TECH COMMUNITY ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACING BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF OUTDATED GOVERNMENT POLICIES. THIS IS ABOUT 50 MINUTES. MR. >> GOOD MORNING. WELCOME. FOR THOSE OF HOW HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE, CIVIC HALL IS A COMMUNITY CENTER AND EVENT SPACE FOCUSED ON CIVIC INNOVATION AND A COLLABORATIVE WORKSPACE FOR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. IT'S WITH GREAT PLEASURE TODAY THAT WE'RE ABLE TO HOST THIS EVENT AND SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM FLORIDA AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 2016, SENATOR MARCO RUBIO. [APPLAUSE] MR. RUBIO: THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS -- A LITTLE LOUD. IS THAT BETTER? SO I'M HERE TODAY NOT TO JUST TELL YOU MY IDEAS, BUT TO LISTEN TO YOURS. I THINK THAT THE BIG PART OF WHAT A CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT IS THE LISTENING PART. NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEEDS OF THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY AS WELL AS THOSE OF WHO YOU ARE BUILDING IT. COMING INTO THE DISCUSSION, HERE'S SOMETHING I CAN STATE TO YOU WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE. IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT MATTERS IN THE 21ST CENTURY, IT'S INNOVATION. IN ORDER TO BE THE LEADING ECONOMY ON EARTH, AMERICA MUST BE THE MOST INNOVATIVE ECONOMY ON EARTH. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT INNOVATION, WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PROBLEM SOLVING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FINDING WAYS TO DO THINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY, MORE AFFORDABLY AND MORE CONVENIENTLY THAN EVER BEFORE. I WANT TO BEGIN BY TELLING YOU ABOUT A PROBLEM THAT I HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT AMERICAN INNOVATORS, INCLUDING MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM, ARE ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE. AND THEN I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW. WHICH IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS OFTEN GETTING IN THE WAY OF SOLVING IT. SO MY PROBLEM WAS THIS. A FEW MONTHS AGO MY REFRIGERATOR AT MY HOME BROKE IT. JUST STOPPED WORKING IT. DIED OUNLS. WITH FOUR GROWING KIDS HOME FOR SUMMER BREAK IN FLORIDA, YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS FACING SOME PRESSURE TO GET IT FIXED. SO I GOOGLED APPLIANCE REPAIR COMPANIES IN MIAMI AND I MADE SOME CALLS. FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS FRUSTRATINGLY DIFFICULT TO GET ANYONE TO TAKE ME OFF HOLD OR EVEN TO CALL ME BACK. WHEN I FINALLY GOT IN TOUCH WITH A REAL PERSON THEY SAID, NO PROBLEM, WE CAN HAVE SOMEONE OUT TO YOUR HOUSE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO LOOK AT IT. THAT JUST CAN'T BE HOW OUR ECONOMY WORKS IN THE YEAR 2015. OTHER THINGS THAT TOOK THREE DAYS IN THE OLD ECONOMY NOW TAKE THREE MINUTES OR THREE SECONDS. WHAT STRUCK ME IN THAT MOMENT WAS THE FOLLOWING REALIZATION. INEVITABLY, SOMEWHERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM ME, THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS CAPABLE OF REPAIRING APPLIANCES, SOMEONE WHO IS JUST AS EAGER TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY THAT DAY AS I WAS EAGER TO HAVE A FUNCTIONAL REFRIGERATOR. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THIS PERSON AND I HAD NO WAY OF FINDING EACH OTHER OR CONNECTING. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WILL NOT EXIST WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO. AT LEAST NOT IF AMERICAN INNOVATORS HAVE THEIR WAY. THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY. THIS IS A REVOLUTION THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE OUR ISLES. ALSO KNOWN AS THE SHARING ECONOMY OR THE GIG ECONOMY. THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY IS ALLOWING MILLIONS OF PROFESSIONALS ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES TO CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH CONSUMERS. THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLES, FOLKS, ARE COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND AIRBNB. LAST WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT AMAZON AND GOOGLE WOULD BE ENTERING THE ON-DEMAND MARKET. RIGHT BEHIND THESE GIANTS ARE THOUSANDS OF SMALL INNOVATIVE STARTUPS AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THEM YET, JUST WAIT. THE ON-DEMAND PLATFORM IS ONE EXAMPLE OF AN IMPORTANT TRUTH FACING US IN THIS ELECTION. WHICH IS THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, AS THE GLOBAL ONE, IS FUNDAMENTALLY BEING TRANSFORMED. UBER DIDN'T EVEN EXIST WHEN OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE. AND TODAY IT IS WORTH OVER $51 BILLION. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMY IS CHANGING. THE FACT IS THAT THE ECONOMY IS CHANGING FASTER THAN IT HAS EVER CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, IT TOOK THE TELEPHONE 75 YEARS TO REACH 100 MILLION USERS. IT TOOK CANDY CRUSH ONE YEAR TO REACH 100 MILLION USERS. AND YET WHILE OUR ECONOMY IS CHANGING AND CHANGING FAST, OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS POLICIES ARE NOT. QUITE FRANKLY, BOTH PARTIES ARE TO BLAME. NEVER BEFORE, AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME, HAS THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT IN THIS COUNTRY BEEN MORE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAN IT IS TODAY. THE RESULT IS A WORSENING FRICTION BETWEEN OUR 20TH CENTURY GOVERNMENT AND OUR RAPIDLY CHANGING 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY. AND NOWHERE IS THAT FRICTION MORE APPARENT THAN IN THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY. HERE YOU HAVE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES WHO ARE RUNNING UP AGAINST AN ANTIQUATED TAX CODE, BURDENSOME REGULATION AND NUMEROUS, NUMEROUS OUTDATED POLITICIANS. THAT'S NOT ALL. THE COMPANIES ARE ALSO VICTIMS OF A COORDINATED ATTACK FROM ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES WHICH INFLUENCE THE POLITICAL PROCESS TO PASS NEW REGULATIONS THAT BLOCK COMPETITION. WE'VE SEEN THIS PLAY OUT WITH TAXI COMPANIES LOBBYING TO STOP UBER AND HERE IN NEW YORK THE GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING MILLIONS TO TRY AND STOP AIRBNB FROM THREATENING HOTEL CHAINS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE TODAY. I WANT TO TELL BUT A GROWING COMPANY BASED RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK THAT, LIKE ALL BUSINESSES IN THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY, IS FACING UNNECESSARY CHALLENGES. AS A RESULT OF THE OUTDATED GOVERNMENT. IT'S A COMPANY CALLED HANDY. AND ITS C.E.O. IS HERE TODAY. HANDY IS A ONLINE PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH HOME CLEANERS, HANDYMEN, PLUMBERS AND OTHER HOME SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. IT'S QUICKLY GROWING, IT'S NOW OPERATING IN 37 CITIES WITH OVER 11,000 PROFESSIONAL AS REGISTERED TO USE THE PLATFORM. HANDY IS GROWN BREAKING FOR CONSUMERS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. IT PROVIDES SIMPLE BOOKING AT THE TAP OF A FINGER, A RATING AND REVIEW PROCESS THAT HELPS PEOPLE FIND THE BEST CONTRACTOR FOR THEIR NEEDS, AND AN EASY ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES HAGGLING OVER PRICES. BUT IT ISN'T JUST GREAT FOR CONSUMERS. ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE MOST ABOUT THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY IS THE WAY IT PROMOTES UPWARD MOBILITY FOR THE PROFESSIONALS WHO USE IT. THROUGH HANDY, WORKERS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO START THEIR OWN CLEANING BUSINESS, THEY CAN NOW HAVE ALL THE INDEPENDENCE OF SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND THE CUSTOMER BASE OF A LARGE ESTABLISHED BUSINESS. PROFESSIONALS WHO USE HANDY CAN EARN AN AVERAGE OF $18 AN HOUR, WHICH IS MORE THAN THE TYPICAL WORKER IN THE FIELD. BEST OF ALL, THEY SET THEIR OWN HOURS. CHECKING INTO THE APP WHENEVER THEY HAVE TIME TO TAKE ON A JOB AND SIGNING OUT WHEN THEY HAVE OTHER OBLIGATIONS. MANY WORKERS USE THIS FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION, WHICH IS CENTRAL TO UPWARD MOBILITY IN THIS NEW CENTURY. OTHERS USE IT TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN OR WORK OTHER JOBS. INNOVATIONS LIKE HANDY ARE PART OF THE REASON WHY I'M SO OPTIMISTIC, NOT ONLY ABOUT SAVING THE AMERICAN DREAM IN THIS CENTURY, BUT ACTUALLY ABOUT EXPANDING IT. TO REACH MORE PEOPLE AND CHANGE MORE LIVES THAN EVER BEFORE. IN THE LAST CENTURY, MY MOTHER WORKED AS A MAID IN HOTELS. SHE HAD NO CONTROL OVER HER SCHEDULE. NO INFLUENCE OVER HOW MUCH SHE EARNED. AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SET HERSELF APART. AND YET SHE ACHIEVED THE AMERICAN DREAM. JUST THINK WHAT SHE COULD HAVE ACHIEVED CLEANING HOMES THROUGH A COMPANY LIKE HANDY. SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TOTAL CONTROL OVER HER OWN FINANCIAL LIFE. THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY IS A MIRACLE THAT ONLY AMERICAN FREE ENTERPRISE COULD PRODUCE. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO SHAMEFUL SHAT -- THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO THE GROWTH OF THIS PLATFORM IS OUR VERY OWN GOVERNMENT. IN FACT, THINK ABOUT THIS. I MET THE C.E.O. OF AN ON-DEMAND STARTUP A FEW WEEKS AGO AND HE ASKED ME NOT TO MENTION HIS BUSINESS TODAY OUT OF FEAR, OUT OF FEAR THAT HE WOULD ATTRACT ATTENTION FROM LEGISLATORS, FROM LAWYERS AND FROM COMPETITORS. WHAT DOES THIS SAY? DO WE WANT AMERICA TO BE A PLACE WHERE HONEST, INNOVATIVE BUSINESSES HAVE TO HIDE THEIR SUCCESS? OF COURSE WE DO NOT. WE NEED TO BE THE MOST BUSINESS FRIENDLY ECONOMY ON EARTH. BUT RIGHT NOW WITH THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD AND A REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT'S DIRECTLY HOSTILE TO INNOVATION, THAT'S QUITE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. HERE ARE SOME OF THE OBSTACLES THAT HANDY AND COMPANIES LIKE IT FACE EVERY DAY. FIRST, AN OUTDATED TAX CODE. COMPANIES LIKE HANDY HAVE ONLY TWO OPTIONS FOR HOW TO CLASSIFY THEIR PROFESSIONALS WHO UTILIZE THEIR SERVICES. THEY CAN EITHER BE CLASSIFIED AS FULL W-2 EMPLOYEES OR THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS 1099 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. BUT NEITHER ONE OF THESE MAKES PERFECT SENSE. IF HANDY'S C.E.O. CLASSIFIES THE WORKERS AS W-2 EMPLOYEES, THEN MUCH OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT MAKES WORKING WITH HANDY SO APPEALING WOULD DISAPPEAR. HE'D HAVE TO REGULATE THE WORKERS' HOURS AND HE'D HAVE TO COMPLY WITH A LITANY OF EXPENSIVE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD STUNT THE GROWTH OF THE COMPANY. SO INSTEAD THE C.E.O. MAKES SURE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP COMPLIES WITH THE 1099 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS. BUT THIS CAUSES OTHER COMPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY CAN'T PROVIDE TRAINING TO ITS CONTRACTORS. THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE RECOMMENDATION AS TO THEM BASED ON CUSTOMER FEEDBACK. THEY CAN'T EVEN ASK THEM TO WEAR A SHIRT OR UNIFORM WITH A HANDY LOGO ON IT. THE C.E.O. IS ALSO PREVENTED FROM PROVIDING THE PERKS AND BENEFITS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ATTRACT MORE HIGH QUALITY PROFESSIONALS TO THE PLATFORM. THINK ABOUT HOW AROONIC THAT IS. -- IRONIC THAT IS. OUR OUTDATED POLITICIANS BASH THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY FOR NOT TAKING BETTER CARE OF WORKERS YET OUR OUTDATED GOVERNMENT IS THE EXACT FORCE PRI PRESENTING IT FROM DOING -- PREVENTING IT FROM DOING SO. THAT'S WHY I'VE PROPOSED A COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM PLAN THAT IS BOTH PRO-GROWTH AND PRO-FAMILY AND TODAY I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH ALL OF A YOU SOME ADDITIONAL WAYS TO MAKE THE TAX CODE MORE WELCOMING TO ON-DEMAND COMPANIES. SOME IDEAS I'VE HAD ARE TO MAINTAIN THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE STANDARD FOR TAXATION A, FOR ONLINE PURCHASES. TO STOP DISCRIMINATORY TAXATION OF DIGITAL GOODS AND SERVICES LIKE APP DOWNLOADS AND TO ENSURE THAT THE INTERNET REMAINS TAX-FREE. BUT ON-DEMAND COMPANIES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES HURT BY OUR TAX CODE. THEY ALSO FACE THE UNCERTAINTY OF A VOLATILE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. JUST LAST WEEK, LAST FRIDAY ACTUALLY, THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SAID THAT THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY WOULD REQUIRE, QUOTE, TARGETED REGULATORY MEASURES, UNQUOTE. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT ALL THE BEST INNOVATION IN OUR ECONOMY IS HAPPENING IN THE UNREGULATED SPACE. YET WASHINGTON HAS IMPOSED 60,000 PAGES OF NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS JUST THIS YEAR, COSTING OUR PRIVATE ECONOMY ALMOST -- OVER OR ALMOST $70 BILLION IN TOTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS. AS PRESIDENT I WILL PUT AN END TO THIS. I WILL PLACE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF REGULATIONS -- ON THE AMOUNT REGULATIONS CAN COST OUR ECONOMY EACH YEAR. I WILL ALSO REQUIRE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD IMPACT COMPETITION AND OVATION. I BELIEVE THE MORE AMERICA REGULAR LATE -- REGULATES, THE MORE WE CREATE AN OPENING FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO DEREGULATE AND DRAW JOBS AWAY FROM OUR SHORES. OTHER NATIONS ARE ALREADY SCRAMBLING TO KATER TO THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY. GERMANY, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS CREATED A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THIS CLASSIFICATION IS CALLED DEPEND CONTRACTORS -- DEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. IT ALLOWS PROFESSIONALS TO WORK FOR A SICKLE COMPANY, RECEIVE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS AND YET RETAIN CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN WORK. WHETHER THIS MODEL IS THE BEST OPTION FOR AMERICA OR NOT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT. BUT HERE'S WHAT I KNOW FOR SURE. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT IN THIS COUNTRY THINKS ABOUT THE NEW ECONOMY. RIGHT NOW THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE NEW ECONOMY DOESN'T FIT OUR CURRENT TAX CODE AND OUR CURRENT WAY OF DOING THINGS, SO THEY ASK THEMSELVES, HOW CAN WE FORCE THE NEW ECONOMY TO AA DAPT TO OUR OLD POLICIES -- TO ADOPT TO OUR POLE, OLD POLICIES RATHER THAN ASKING, HOW CAN WE CHANGE OUR OLD POLICIES TO ADAPT TO THE NEW ECONOMY? THIS HAS ALWAYS -- THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE AMERICAN WAY. WE ARE A UNIQUE NATION IN ALL THE WORLD'S HISTORY. A NATION FOUNDED ON THE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GET TO CHOOSE WHAT OUR ECONOMY LOOKS LIKE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR GET TO CHOOSE. AND GUESS WHAT? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN. THEY HAVE CHOSEN A CONVENIENT, FAST, TECH-DRIVEN ECONOMY, ONE WITH DIRECT LANE OF AC A SESS TO THE PRODUCT AND THE SERVICES THEY WANT AND NEED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN AN ECONOMY IN WHICH THE MOST VALUABLE RETAILER IN AMERICA, AMAZON, DOESN'T OWN A SINGLE STORE. THEY HAVE CHOSEN WHERE THE LARGEST TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, UBER, DOESN'T OWN A SINGLE VEHICLE. AND WHERE THE LARGEST ACCOMMODATION PROVIDER, AIRBNB, DOES NOT OWN A SINGLE HOTEL. FREE ENTERPRISE HAS BROUGHT US THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND FREE ENTERPRISE WILL BRING US EVEN MORE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD. IN FACT, I BELIEVE FREE ENTERPRISE WILL WORK BETTER IN THIS CENTURY THAN IT DID IN THE LAST CENTURY. BECAUSE THE NEW ECONOMY IS ALL ABOUT INNOVATION, CREATIVITY AND PRODUCTIVITY AND WE AMERICANS ARE THE MOST INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE ON THE EARTH. I BELIEVE THE 21ST CENTURY NOT ONLY CAN BE THE AMERICAN CENTURY, I BELIEVE IT WILL BE THE AMERICAN CENTURY. IT WILL BE AS LONG AS EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KEEPS DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND AS LONG AS WE CAN GET WASHINGTON TO STOP DOING WHAT ITS DOING AND START LOOKING FOR A BETTER WAY. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR IDEAS AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU FOR THE TUNAL OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> WE'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION. I'LL START. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION YOU'D LIKE TO ASK, IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES, THERE ARE TWO MICROPHONES IN THE AISLES. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BASED ON ANALITY AER NATING BETWEEN, SO I'LL GIVE YOU A SIGNAL WHEN WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE QUESTIONS. SENATOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO CIVIC HALL AND FOR TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF CASES WHERE INCUMBENT MARKET FORCES WHO HAVE POLITICAL INFLUENCE HAVE REACTED TO THE COMPETITION THAT THE SHARING ECONOMY COMPANIES ARE GIVING THEM. AND A THEY'RE USING THEIR POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO TRY AND STOP THESE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES. THIS IS ALL EVENTUALLY TIED TO MONEY AND POLITICS. IT'S GREAT, AND I HEAR YOU WHEN YOU SAY THAT GOVERNMENT IS TARGETING, BUT IF YOU FOLLOW THE MONEY, IT GOES BACK TO THE INCUMBENT MARKET. HOW DO YOU BREAK THAT CYCLE? MR. RUBIO: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. I THINK PART OF IT IS TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT EXPERIENCING AN ECONOMIC DOWN TURN. WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MASS OF ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING. IT'S LIKE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION HAPPENING EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO OUR POLICIES NEED TO REFLECT THAT. AND IN REFLECTING THAT, THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO ASCRIBE TO THE NEW ECONOMY ATTRIBUTES OF THE OLD ECONOMY. SO THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE A LIMITED GOVERNMENT IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. THE LARGER THE GOVERNMENT, THE MORE POWERFUL THE GOVERNMENT IS, THE MORE INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS OVER THE ECONOMY, THE MORE THE PEOPLE OR THE COMPANIES THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT WIN AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYBODY ELSE. SO YOU HAVE MASSIVE -- THAT'S WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORY BUDGET IS SO IMPORTANT. THE FAVORITE WAY OF ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES TO BLOCK AN INNOVATIVE COMPETITOR IS TO CREATE A REGULATORY IMPEDIMENT TO THAT COMPETITOR, TO ENTER THE SPACE. I ALWAYS USE THIS EXAMPLE, IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT, BUT IMAGINE A BLOCK BUST VOOR, IF YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND THIS ROOM, SOME OF YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, A BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO HAD CONVINCED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PASS A REGULATION SAYING, IN ORDER TO RENT MOVIES YOU MUST COME INTO A PHYSICAL STORE AND SHOW YOUR I.D. BUZZ WE WANT TO PREVENT UNDERAGE KIDS FROM RENTING RATED R MOVIE, THEY'D STILL BE IN BUSINESS AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE DOWNLOADING. THAT'S THE MENTALITY THAT EXISTS IN ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES. THEY FIND SOME SORT OF ARGUMENT AND THEY USE IT TO CREATE A ROAD BLOCK THAT THE INNOVATOR CAN'T MEET. >> THE REASON THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND CREATE THAT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS AND THAT ACCESS IS TIED TO GIVING MONEY TO POLITICAL DAND DATE CONSCIOUS CANDIDATES OR OFFICIALS. MR. RUBIO: PART OF IT IS ELECTING PEOPLE WHO WON'T FALL FOR THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S AN IMPEDIMENT TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT'S WHY THE REGULATORY BUDGET IS ONE OF THE PROPOSAL AS I HAVE. >> YESTERDAY A NEW REPORT CAME OUT FROM THE FREELANCERS UNION THAT STATES THAT 54 MILLION AMERICAN, ALMOST 1/3 OF THE WORK FORCE, IS DOING FREELANCE WORK. IT'S NOT JUST IN URBAN AREAS, IT'S IN RURAL AREAS, THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 86% OF THE NATION'S FREELANCERS ARE LIKELY TO VOTE IN 2016. 62% ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE WHO SUPPORTS FREELANCERS' INTERESTS. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY WORKING FOR HANDY OR FOR UBER OR ANY OF THE SHARING COMPANIES, THEY'RE JUST WORKING ON THEIR OWN BUT THEY CARE ABOUT THINGS LIKE RETIREMENT SAVINGS, HEALTH CARE, LEGAL SUPPORT FOR NONPAYMENT BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S NOT PAYING THEM. AND OTHER ISSUES UNIQUE TO THIS GROUP. WHATEVER A WORKER REALLY WANTS IS FLEXIBLE WORK BUT ALSO STABLE WORK. WHAT WOULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT -- MR. RUBIO: YOU RAISE A COUPLE OF INTERESTING POINTS. OUR 21ST CENTURY HEALTH CARE IS ON THE WORKER MODEL. WE WORK FOR SOMEBODY, THOSE PEOPLE OFFER YOU AN INSURANCE PLAN, THAT'S HOW YOU GET YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE. IN THE 2169 CENTURY, THAT CANNOT BE THE CORNER STONE OF OUR SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PORTABLE SYSTEM OF HEALTH INSURANCE, WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTROL THEIR OWN PRETAX HEALTH CARE MONEY, WHETHER IT'S AN EMPLOYER THAT GIVES IT TO YOU, WHETHER IT'S YOUR OWN MONEY OR A TAX A CREDIT. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE, AND YOU CAN USE IT TO BUY YOUR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE FROM ANY COMPANY THAT WILL SELL IT TO YOU. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'VE ARGUED WE SHOULD OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL RETIREMENT PLAN. THE CONGRESS, AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEDERAL 2015 SAVINGS PLAN. THAT'S ONLY AVAILABLE TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND IT'S A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY PERFORMS WELL. I'VE ARGUED WE SHOULD OPEN UP THAT PLAN TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE A RETIREMENT PLAN OFFERED TO THEM BY AN EMPLOYER. SO THEY TOO CAN PAY INTO AND HAVE ACCESS TO CONGRESSIONAL RETIREMENT PLAN AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT PROGRAM. I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PROVIDE THAT SORT OF STABILITY, THAT ONCE CAME FROM A TRADITIONAL EMPLOYER. IN THE 21ST CENTURY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF AMERICANS WON'T BE THAT -- BE THAT DRIGSLY EXPLODE -- TRADITIONALLY EMPLOYED. >> YOU CAME OUT AGAINST THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. IN THE SHARING ECONOMY, WHAT'S TO KEEP FROM US HAVING A RACE TO THE BOTTOM? THE PERSON WHO IS WILLING TO DELIVER FOOD FOR $4 IS BEATEN OUT BY THE PERSON WILLING TO DO IT FOR $3 AN HOUR. MR. RUBIO: I'M I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF GETTING RID OF THE MINIMUM WAGE COMPLETELY. I'VE ARGUED AGAINST INCREASING IT FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MACHINES. THE SECOND POINT, IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE ARE BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CANNOT PASS THROUGH THE COST, THAT WILL ADJUST TO A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE BY EITHER HIRING LESS PEOPLE, CUTTING HOURS, CUTTING BENEFITS. AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE HARMED BY. THAT I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY TO RAISE WAGES. I THINK THE BETTER WAY TO RAISE WAGES IS A COMBINATION OF CREATING AN DEME THAT -- AN ECONOMY THAT CREATES JOBS THAT PAY MORE BUT ALSO MAKING IT EASIER AND CHEAPER FOR PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE THE ADVANCED EDUCATION THEY NEED TO QUALIFY FOR THE BEST PAYING JOBS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, I'VE ARGUED ABOUT OPENING SPACE FOR COMPETENCY-BASED LEARNING. IN A BIPARTISAN BILL, WITH MIKE BENNETT OF COLORADO AND MYSELF HAVE OFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITTING MODEL THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET THE EQUIVALENT OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION BUT DO IT BY A MEANS THAT ALLOW YOU TO PACKAGE LEARNING FROM A VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES. WE SHOULD OPEN UP PELL GRANT AND STUDENT FINANCIAL AID TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO DUEL ENROLL. -- DUAL ENROLL. I ALSO THINK WE'LL HAVE TRADITIONAL FOUR-YEAR EDUCATION. BUT I'VE ARGUED THAT STUDENTS DESERVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THAT THANK SCHOOL WITH THAT DEGREE BEFORE THEY BORROW MONEY TO PAY FOR IT. SO I HAVE A BIPARTISAN BILL CALLED RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO WITH RON WHITE OF OREGON THAT THANK REQUIRES THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE OUT A LOAN, YOU ARE TOLD HOW MUCH PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THAT SCHOOL. THAT'S A BETTER WAY TO RAISE WAGES. IS TO BOTH CREATE THE POLICIES THAT ALLOW AMERICA TO BE THE EASIEST AND BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO CREATE BETTER PAYING JOBS AND MAKE IT EASIER, FASTER AND CHEAPER FOR PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE THE SKILLS THEY NEED FOR THOSE BETTER PAYING JOBS. >> YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANT TO LIMIT REGULATION BUT IN SOME CASES THESE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES HAVE FANTASTIC SERVICES BUT THERE ARE COLLATERAL EFFECTS. FOR EXAMPLE, AIRBNB, WHICH MANY PEOPLE LOVE, BOTH THE USERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TRANSACTION LOVE, BUT IN SOME CASES LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE USING AIRBNB TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR INCOMES. THEIR LANDLORDS ARE FINDING OUT, THEY'RE GETTING EVICTED. THE LANDLORD TAKES THAT APARTMENT TO MARKET RENT. LOW INCOME HOUSING DROPS. THERE'S A COLLATERAL EFFECT. YOU CAN PROBABLY FOLLOW A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES' PATH AND START SEEING A WAKE OF COLLATERAL EFFECT WHICH MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE SO GREAT, SO IF YOU HAVE NO REGULATION, HOW DO YOU PREVENT COLLATERAL EFFECTS FROM COMING BACK AND BITING US? MR. RUBIO: I WANT THE WE -- I WANT THE WATER WE DRINK TO NOT BE POISONED. I FLY ON PLANES, I'M GLAD THEY'RE REGULATED. I'M ARGUING THERE COMES A POINT WHEN REGULATIONS GO TOO FAR AND THEY BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT TO INNOVATION. IN THE CASE OF A PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER, IF I'M A PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER, I OWN MY OWN PROPERTY, I CAN PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON HOW TENANTS CAN USE PROPERTY. PEOPLE DO THAT ALL THE TIME. THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM A GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT PLACES THAT RESTRICTION ARTIFICIALLY, AS OPPOSED TO A CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTION. THAT'S A SITUATION YOU'RE FACING. STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN DISRUPTIVE. THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS DEEPLY DISRUPTIVE. WE HAD TO WORK THROUGH ISSUES OF CHILD LABOR AND SAFETY ISSUES AT FACTORIES THAT WE NEVER HAD BEFORE AS A SOCIETY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DISRUPTIONS WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WALK AWAY FROM THIS. THIS IS THE FUTURE. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO THE 20TH CENTURY. THE ONLY CHOICE BEFORE US IS DO WE EMBRACE THE FUTURE, HARNESS ITS PROMISE OR ALLOW IT TO LEAVE US BEHIND. THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE BEFORE US. THIS ARGUE AMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS OR THE WAY THINGS ONCE WERE IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IF WE DO WE'RE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND BY THE FEWER. >> SHARING ECONOMY HAS BECOME A BUZZ TERM. BUT DOESN'T FULLY EXPLAIN THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK IN AMERICA. COMPANIES LIKE AIRBNB AND LIFT AND UBER ARE EXAMPLES, AND EVEN HANDY, ARE MIDDLEMEN IN EFFECT BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO PROVIDE A SERVICE AND SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. WOULDN'T WE BE BETTER OFF JUST BUILDING COOPERATIVES WHERE THE PEOPLE CAN FIND EACH OTHER WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY A MIDDLEMAN TO DO THE TRANSACTION? BECAUSE ONCE YOU BUILD THAT PLATFORM -- MR. RUBIO: WHO'S GOING TO BUILD THAT PLATFORM? THE GOVERNMENT? >> CITIZENS COULD DO IT AND A MAKE IT MORE OPEN SO THE SHARE HOLD, -- MR. RUBIO: I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET INNOVATION THAT WAY. THE WAY YOU COME UP WITH GREAT IDEAS IS SOMEONE SAYS, I HAVE A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK I CAN MAKE MONEY ON, IT I'M GOING TO DO IT. EVERY MAJOR INNOVATION IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN DRISK THAN WAY. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING CERTAINS TO INDIVIDUALS. YOU MAY BELIEVE IN YOUR IDEA, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE REASON WHY IT'S CREATED IS BECAUSE THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE. SOMEBODY HAS MADE A DECISION, I THINK I CAN DO THIS FOR A LIVING AND SO THEY FOUND THESE IDEAS. I THINK IF YOU'RE COUNTING ON THE COLLECTIVE TO COME UP WITH IT ON ITS OWN, THE NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO MOVE INNOVATION. FREE ENTERPRISE HAS PROVEN THAT. THE GREAT COMPANY OF THE YEAR 2025 DOESN'T EXIST YET. SOMEONE IS PROBABLY 14 YEARS OLD PLAYING MINE CRAFT RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT -- THEY SHOULDN'T BE PLAYING RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THIS THING TOGETHER IN EIGHT OR NINE YEARS. BUT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE MONEY DOING IT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROFIT MOTIVE INVOLVED IN DRIVING THESE. >> FOSOME PEOPLE ARGUE THERE ARE NEW MONOPOLIES BEING CREATED BY NEW TECH COMPANIES NOW THAT ARE WILL PREVENT INNOVATION. MR. RUBIO: YOU CAN VERY MUCH BE A CREATURE OF THE NEW ECONOMY AND ONCE YOU ARE ESTABLISHED DECIDE YOU'RE AN INCUMBENT INDUSTRY. EVERY ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY WAS ONCE AN INNOVATOR. I'M NOT ARGUE AING THAT NEW ECONOMY CREATURES ARE GOING TO NOT BEHAVE IN THE SAME FASHION EVENTUALLY. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE IS A FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM THAT SAYS THIS NO MATTER HOW GREAT YOUR IDEA, IS YOU CAN BE OUT OF BUSINESS IN TWO YEARS IF SOMEONE COMES UP WITH A BETTER SERVICE, A BETTER IDEA AND CAN DELIVER IT AT A BETTER PRICE. >> WHAT IF A COMPANY LIKE UBER, FOR EXAMPLE, DECIDES TO CUT ITS PRICES BECAUSE IT CAN AFFORD TO AND PREVENT OTHERS IN COMPANY THAT MAY WANT TO CREATE CAR SHARING IN A DIFFERENT WAY, LIKE CAR POOLING, FROM EVEN BEING ABLE TO ENTER THE MARKET? THERE'S NO ONE TO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE THE FIRST MOVER MADE A HUGE ADVANTAGE AND GOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND NOW THEY'RE BURNING MONEY IN ORDER TO PROTECT -- MR. RUBIO: THE TRUTH ABOUT THE NEW ECONOMY IS THE COMPETITOR TO UBER MAY NOT OFFER A DIRECT EXACT MODEL IT. WON'T BE JUST A CHEAPER VERSION OF UBER. IT WILL BE A NEW SYSTEM OR WAY OF USING SHARING THAT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MODEL UBER IS USING. WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF THIS ALL THE TIME. FIVE YEARS AGO, THREE YEARS AGO, WHATEVER IT MAY BE, THE CUTTING EDGE INDUSTRY OR THE CUTTING EDGE COMPANY OR FIRM HAS VERY MUCH BEEN REPLACED BY A NEW ONE THAT CAME IN AND DID KIND OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING BUT AN EVEN BETTER AND MORE CREATIVE WAY. I DON'T THINK THAT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN THAT REALM IS GOING TO LEAD TO THE SORT OF INNOVATION. WHAT IT'S GOING TO END UP DOING IS SETTING AND CONCRETE AND DRYING THE EXISTING INNOVATION THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. >> YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE A 20TH CENTURY GOVERNMENT BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND CHANGE AND SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE REGULATORS ARE REACTING AS OPPOSED TO STAYING AHEAD. IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT, WHERE IT DOES NEED TO REGULATE, FOR EXAMPLE, AIRLINES, MAKING SURE THEY'RE SAFE, STAYS AHEAD OF THE TECHNOLOGY? PLANES RIT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, AREN'T CONNECTED 24/7, WE STILL CHASE AFTER BLACK BOXING WHEN THEY CRASH. THERE IS A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT TO STAY AHEAD OF TECHNOLOGY. BESIDES JUST CUTTING THE REGULATORS' BUDGET AND LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF REGULATION, HOW DO WE KEEP THE GOVERNMENT ON A 21ST CENTURY PATH. MR. RUBIO: THE GOVERNMENT STILL HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN PUBLIC SAFETY. IF YOU'RE AN UBER -- I KEEP GOING BACK TO THE SAME COMPANIES, I DON'T WANT TO PICK ON ANYBODY. BUT THOSE USUAL CARS ARE REGULATED. BEFORE THAT CAR IS ON THE ROAD IT'S BEEN INSPECTED, GONE THROUGH THE TESTING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES FOR MOTOR VEHICLES. IT HAS REGULATIONS LOCALLY ABOUT HOW FAST YOU CAN DRIVE, WHAT THE SAFETY FEATURES NEED TO BE, RULES OF THE ROAD, ALL THOSE THINGS ARE STILL IN PLACE. WE'RE NOT SAYING UBER DRIVERS DON'T HAVE TO OBSERVE TRAFFIC SIGNALS. THEY STILL HAVE TO FOLLOW ALL OF THOSE RULES. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. THE ISSUE IS THE INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR. IT'S A BUSINESS MODEL NOT BEING REGULATED. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD EVER KEEP UP WITH INNOVATE ON A REGULATORY FRONT IT. CAN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH -- INNOVATION ON A REGULATORY FRONT. IT CAN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH. >> I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REGULATION WHEN VOLKSWAGEN IS ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEIR SOFTWARE AND BASICALLY LIE TO THE WORLD ABOUT THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR CARS. SOMEBODY HAS TO HAVE THE BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T DO THAT. IF YOU CUT REGULATION, IT ISN'T JUST GOING ALLOW FOR INNOVATIVE COMPANIES, IT MAY CREATE DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY. MR. RUBIO: A REGULATORY BUDGET IS NOT JUST ABOUT CUTTING REGULATIONS. A REGULATORY BUDGET IS DESIGNED TO FORCE PRIORITIZATION. THROUGH A COST-BENEFIT ANAL SILLS. ALL IT SAYS IS THAT -- ANALYSIS. ALL IT SAYS IS THAT A CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS CANNOT EXCEED A CERTAIN. A MONEY. THESE AGENCIES MUST DECIDE WHICH REGULATIONS ARE WORTHY. IF WE ONLY CAN HAVE X NUMBER OF REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE THE ONES WE REALLY NEED AND WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT AREN'T JUSTIFIED. THAT'S WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO. >> ON A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS, SOME PEOPLE WITH A SAY GET RID OF GAS EMISSIONS BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER TO MAKE CARS THAT DON'T SAVE AIR POLLUTION. A HUGE COST TO THE ENVIRONMENT. MR. RUBIO: THEN THOSE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THAT DECISION WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR ELECTORATE . WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN KEEP ADD AING NEW REGULATIONS WITHOUT REMOVING EXISTING ONES. IT'S A SYSTEM OF PERPETUAL REGULATORY GROWTH. WITHOUT ANY COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. MANY REGULATIONS ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE BECAUSE OF THE THEORETICAL VALUE OF THE REGULATION OR BECAUSE SOMEONE HIRED THE RIGHT PERSON TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. >> WE'LL START TAKING SOME QUESTIONS. I JUST HAVE ONE MORE. THE WHITE HOUSE RECENTLY LAUNCHED A PROGRAM CALLED THE U.S. DIGITAL SERVICE. WHICH IS TO BRING THE NATION'S TOP ENGINEERS TO WORK INSIDE GOVERNMENT, TO FIX PROBLEMS. FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THE V.A. BACKLOG. AND SAVE MONEY. IN FACT, SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON OLD ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY SPENDS. IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM AND WOULD YOU EXPAND IT? MR. RUBIO: WE WANT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS FIRST. IT'S BEEN OFFERED AS A PILOT INITIALLY. A VERY SMALL AMOUNT. $0 MILLION. BUT I THINK IF IT PROVES TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S EFFECTIVE, WHERE WE CAN ATTRACT SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN THE COUNTRY TO DEDICATE THEMSELVES TO PUBLIC SERVICE FOR X NUMBER OF YEARS, TO CREATE SOLUTIONS TO HOW GOVERNMENT PROVIDES SERVICES, THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE OPEN TO. >> I WANT TO ASK EVERYBODY TO PLEASE HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS REMAIN ON THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S TALK, IF YOU COULD. QUESTIONER: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I VERY MUCH ENJOY YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY. ESPECIALLY YOU MENTIONED THE AMERICAN DREAM. I'M A DACA RECIPIENT. DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVAL. I HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC. I AM IN THE TECH INDUSTRY. YOU'VE SAID OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON WHETHER YOU HAVE A RELATIVE HERE RATHER THAN MARRIED. AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO FIX THE LOTTERY SYSTEM TO ATTRACT AND KEEP THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST TALENT IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY FOR TECH? MR. RUBIO: FIRST OF ALL, DO I BELIEVE WE NEED REFORMS TO. THAT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SOME OF IT IS BEING ABUSED BY EXISTING COMPANIES AND THE OTHER PART OF IT IS SOMETIMES THE VISA, IS WITHIN THREE DAYS ALL THE SLOTS ARE GONE. COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA ARE DELIBERATELY TARGETING TO STEAL AWAY SOME OF THE BEST TALENT GRADUATING FROM OUR UNIVERSITIES BY BRAGGING THAT YOU CAN GET THE WORK FORCE TO LIVE IN CANADA BUT NOT IN THE U.S. I HAVE A PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT EXPANDS THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO CREATES RULES AND REGULATIONS SO IT CAN'T BE ABUSED AND USED AGAINST THE AMERICAN WORKER. BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS ON THE -- WE ADMIT A MILLION PEOPLE TO THE -- A MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR TO THE UNITED STATES PERMANENTLY. MY ARGUMENT IS, IF YOU'RE IN THE BEST -- IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST PEOPLE AT WHAT YOU DO, I DON'T WANT YOU TEMPORARILY HERE, I WANT YOU HERE PERMANENTLY. I WANT TO YOU BECOME AN AMERICAN. I WANT YOU TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY AND BECOME INGRAINED IN OUR SOCIETY AND A CULTURE. WHAT I'VE ARGUED IS THAT THE PERMANENT LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BECOME MORE MERIT-BASED. WE START ADMITTING PEOPLE TO THIS NATION PERMANENTLY, PRIMARILY A ON THE BASIS WHAT HAVE THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE ECONOMICALLY, NOT SIMPLY ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A RELATIVE LESKING HERE THAT SERVES AS -- RELATIVE LIVING HERE THAT SERVES AS THE MAGNET THAT BRINGS YOU IN. THAT'S WHY I'VE ARGUED FOR A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM. IT REFLECTS THE 21ST CENTURY MUCH MORE ACCURATELY. QUESTIONER: HI, I'M DANIELLE THOMPSON. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU REGARDING OPEN GOVERNMENT. AND GOVERNMENT AS PLATFORM. OPEN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT CITIZENS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE DATA, LAWS AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING GOVERNMENT. AND GOVERNMENT AS PLATFORM, AN IDEA THAT BELIEVES GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR CITIZENS TO PLUG AND PLAY INTO THEIR GOVERNMENTS IN ORDER TO GOVERN THEMSELVES BETTER. AS PRESIDENT, HOW WOULD YOU PROMOTE INITIATIVES SUCH AS OPEN GOVERNMENT, WHICH, COMING FROM A CONSERVATIVE UPBRINGING, WHO BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GOVERN THEMSELVES LOCALLY, HOW WILL YOU SUPPORT INITIATIVES OF OPEN GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AS PLATFORM? MR. RUBIO: ONE OF THE PLATFORMS OUT THERE IS ABOUT THE ONLINE BUDGETING INITIATIVES OR OTHER IDEAS TO MAKE MORE TRANSPARENT THE WAY GOVERNMENT OPERATES, PARTICULARLY SPENDING MONEY. BY PROVIDING THAT ON AN EASY TO USE PLATFORM WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN AC A SESS THE MYSTERIOUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND UNDERSTAND WHERE IT'S SPENDING MONEY, HOW THE MONEY'S BEING SPENT, WHAT THE SALARIES OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ARE, WHAT THE SPENDING PRIORITIES ARE. SO I WOULD BE OPEN TO LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY SO THAT ON AN A ONGOING BASIS INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE WAY GOVERNMENT OPERATES AND THE WAY GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY AND THE SIZE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS, AGENCIES, ETC. I THINK TECHNOLOGY HAS EASY SOLUTIONS FOR THAT IF WE'RE WILLING TO IMPLEMENT IT. QUESTIONER: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. CRAIG AARON FROM FREE PRESS. VERY INTERESTED, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING IN THIS DIALOGUE, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT COMPANIES, USERS AND INDIVIDUALS. I THINK THERE'S BEEN THIS INCREDIBLE UPSWING IN INTERNET ACTIVISM IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, UNITING PEOPLE ACROSS PARTY LINES, AROUND ISSUES OF PERSONAL CONTROL. THEY DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR ONLINE EXPERIENCE. BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO HANDFUL OF BIG CORPORATIONS EITHER. I'M CURIOUS AS PRESIDENT WHAT YOU WOULD DO TO PROTECT PRIVACY, PEOPLE'S INFORMATION AND LEAVE THEM IN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN ONLINE EXPERIENCE. MR. RUBIO: THAT'S IMPORTANT. PART OF IT IS WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S LARGELY -- YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WAY YOUR INFORMATION IS USED AS OPPOSED TO THE PRESUMPTION BEING THE OTHER WAY. THERE'S THIS DEBATE BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH SAYS, IF WE CAN'T SELL CONSUMER INFORMATION, THEN WE CAN'T OFFER ALL THESE SERVICES. THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS THAT MANY AMERICAN USERS, PEOPLE EVEN AROUND THE WORLD ARE NOT AWARE THAT THEIR INFORMATION, UNLESS THEY OPT OUT, IS BEING USED AND SOLD AS A MARKETABLE GOOD. THAT TENSION IS VERY REAL. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF WE'RE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BOTH, I'D STILL ERR ON THE SIDE OF PRIVENESY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS TO OPT IN TO THE WAY THEIR INFORMATION IS USED. THAT MEETS ENORMOUS RESISTANCE, ESPECIALLY FROM BANKS, WHO FIND THEIR CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS OF THEIR CLINES VERY VALUABLE -- CLIENTS VERY VALUEBLE. BUT GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN THESE TWO, I THINK WE ALWAYS ARE ON THE SIDE OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION PROTECTED, FROM BEING USED IN WAYS THEY'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF. >> ON THAT TOPIC IN PARTICULAR, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THIS, BUT IN BANKRUPTCY THE CREDITORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN THE TERMS OF SERVICE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY SIGNED EVEN IF PEOPLE OPTED OUT WHEN THEY SIGNED ON. MR. RUBIO: MEANING IF YOU HAVE A LOAN OR BANK ACCOUNT AND YOU OPTED OUT OF THE INFORMATION, ONCE SOMEONE BUYING YOUR DEBT, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY -- >> YEAH, ANY OF THESE SERVICES. THE COMPANIES COLLECTED ALL THAT DATA AND IF FOR SOME REASON THAT COMPANY GOES BANKRUPTCY, -- BANKRUPT, THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO THAT PRIVACY. MR. RUBIO: THIS IS A 21ST CENTURY ISSUE THAT WE'LL HAVE TO CONFRONT. QUESTIONER: IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THESE RIG TO -- REGULATORY BATTLES THAT COMPANIES FIGHT HAPPEN TO BE LOCAL IN NATURE. AIRBNB IN SAN FRANCISCO OR UBER IN FLORIDA. HOW DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GET IN THERE WHILE PRESERVING SOME OF THESE LOCAL -- MR. RUBIO: IT DOESN'T ON THE LOCAL ISSUES. YOU'RE RIGHT. A LOT OF THESE ARE BEING FOUGHT AT MULTIPLE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOTHING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN COULD -- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO TELL A CITY, YOU HAVE TO ALLOW UBER TO OPERATE. WHERE WE HAVE A ROLE IS IN THE TAX TREATMENT AND EMPLOYMENT ISSUES THAT I POINTED OUT ABOUT HOW DO YOU TREAT AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR -- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S A FEDERAL SOLUTION TO ALL OF THIS, BUT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES ARE CONDUCIVE TO INOVATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IN ADDITION TO CREATH CATEGORIES THAT ALLOW US TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEW EMPLOYMENT, MOST AMERICAN BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY SMALLER ONES, TODAY YOU PAY YOUR TAX RATE ON, THAT ON YOUR PERSONAL RATE, NOT ON THE CORPORATE RATE, SO THAT'S WHERE YOU FIND A LARGE ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY MIGHT BE PAYING VERY FEW TAXES. COMPARED TO A MUCH SMALLER COMPANY. I'VE ARGUED THAT ALL A BUSINESS INCOME, NO MATTER HOW YOU'RE STRUCTURED, ALL BUSINESS INCOME SHOULD BE TAXED AT ONE FLAT RATE OF 25% FOR EVERYONE. THAT INCLUDES THE MONEY YOU'RE MAKING IN A SUBCHAPTER S, YOUR BUSINESS INCOME WOULD ONLY BE TAXED AT 25%. NOT AT 39.5% OR 35% OR WHATEVER YOUR PERSONAL RATE MIGHT BE. THAT'S A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR A SMALLER BUSINESS. I WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO IMMEDIATELY EXPENSE ANYTHING THEY INVEST. AGAIN, A LARGE COOPERATION CAN AFFORD TO TAKE THAT DEDUCTION ON A SCHEDULED DEPRECIATION. A SMALL BUSINESS THAT MAY NOT BE AROUND IN FOUR YEARS THEY CAN'T EXPENSE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS UP FRONT RIGHT AWAY. THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF THINGS WE CAN DO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO CREATE A MORE EVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR NEW OPERATORS AND STARTUPS. QUESTIONER: GREG WALTMAN. I HAVE A QUEEN ENERGY ALTERNATIVE ANALYTICAL COMPANY DO INNOVATIONS IN SOCIAL COMBLEED, PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AS WELL. MR. RUBIO: THAT'S A PRETTY BROAD PORTFOLIO. QUESTIONER: GOING BACK TO ACCESS. I WAS WONDERING, MULTIBILLION DOLLAR WIRE FRAUD, THERE WAS A BIG LOSS IN LONDON. >> LET'S STAY ON TOPIC. QUESTIONER: JOURNALISTS SIT ON THE WIRE ALL DAY FOR A COMPANY LIKE TIME WARNER INC., CONTRIBUTING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THE ECONOMY AND TARGET PEOPLE BLOCKING SALES AND BUSINESS -- >> I'M SORRY. I WOULD LIKE TO YOU RESPECT -- IF YOU DON'T MIND. I WOULD REALLY LIKE -- QUESTIONER: [INAUDIBLE] WIRE FRAUD WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DEAL WITH FRAUD? THE ANSWER IS YOU CAN'T. YOU CHEATED ON YOUR WIFE IN FLORIDA AND -- >> I'M SORRY. QUESTIONER: I THINK YOU SHOULD DROP OUT OF THE RACE. YOUR POLLING NUMBERS ARE TOO LOW TO WIN. >> YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE. I APOLOGIZE. MR. RUBIO: ACTUALLY KINET OF -- KIND OF WEIRD ANYWAY. [LAUGHTER] >> BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING. PLEASE. QUESTIONER: I WAS ENJOYING THIS UNTIL THIS LAST SPEAKER. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE AND HAPPY TO LISTEN TO THIS DISCUSSION. BEING ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF INDEPENDENT TAXI OWNERS IN NEW YORK CITY, I DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO HAVE A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT TO MY BUSINESS. BUT I AM ABLE TO ADAPT. SHOULD UBER OR ANY OTHER COMPANY WHO HAS TAXI TECHNOLOGY, WHO HASN'T BOUGHT TAXI RIGHTS, BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE RIGHTS THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR WITHOUT PAYING? MR. RUBIO: I THINK THEY'RE IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODEL. THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS NOT THE SAME AS A TAXI CAB. IT CONNECTS THE USER ON A DIFFERENT PLATFORM AND A DIFFERENT WAY TO THE SERVICE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACQUIRE. AND THAT'S JUST THE RESULT OF AN ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. IT HAPPENS, IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO SOME PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT IS DISRUPTIVE. BUT EVERY TIME WE'VE HAD ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING IN THIS COUNTRY, IT HAS DISPLACED SOME PEOPLE. AND OUR OBLIGATION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED CAN QUICKLY ACCESS THE BENEFITS OF THE NEW ECONOMY OR THE NEW INNOVATION. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVENTION OF THE CAR WAS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THE HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE INDUSTRY, YET WE HAD TO FIGURE A WAY TO GET THOSE PEOPLE ONLINE, EITHER IN A FACTORY BUILDING CARS OR OTHER INDUSTRY THAT WAS CREATED, THAT ALLOWED THEM TO ONCE AGAIN RESTART THEIR LIVES AND GET GOING AND MOVING FORWARD. BUT WE CAN'T STAND IN THE WAY OF THESE INNOVATIONS. THEY'RE GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY'RE GOING TO HAPPEN IN AMERICA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. OUR JOB IS TO DO THE BEST WE CAN TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE CAUGHT IN THAT DISRUPTION, TO EITHER ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS OR ADD TO THEIR EXISTING SKILLS SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF THAT NEW INNOVATIVE ECONOMY. I THINK ANY EFFORT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF INNOVATION, NOT ONLY IS FRUITLESS, IT'S COUSHT PRODUCTIVE. >> GETTING WORKERS RETRAINED BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF EDUCATION. AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BEING BUILT ON THE 21ST CENTURY MODEL RATHER THAN THE -- 20TH CENTURY PRODDLE RATHER THAN THE 21ST -- MODEL RATHER THAN THE 21ST. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH FEDERAL MONEY FOR TEACHER TRAINING OR -- MR. RUBIO: PART OF IT IS, IF YOU'RE A NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT, YOU'RE LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN OR SOMEBODY WHOLES HAS TO WORK FULL TIME AND RAISE A FAMILY, YOU CAN'T DROP EVERYTHING AND SIT IN A CLASSROOM FOR TWO YEARS AND BE RETRAINED IN A GNAW PROFESSION OR ACQUIRE A NEW SKILL. COMPETENT IS HE-BASED PLERNING -- COMPETENCY-BASED LEARNING WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS. NUMBER ONE, IF YOU HAD AN ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITTING MODEL TO THE EXISTING SIX BIG ACCREDITTER TOS THEY WOULD ACCREDIT INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS. IF YOU HAVE 20 YEARS OF WORK EXPERIENCE, THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING. THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN COLLEGE EQUIVALENT CREDIT FOR. AND THEN WHATEVER YOU'RE MISSING YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PACKAGE FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. WHETHER IT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSE WORK, FREE ONLINE COURSES, PAID ONLINE COURSES, ADDITIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN PACKAGE TOGETHER THE EQUIVALENT OF A COLLEGE DEGREE OR THE EQUIVALENT OF A CERTIFICATE AWARD AND USE THAT. >> THAT'S AT THE HIGH LEVEL. MR. RUBIO: NO, THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. YOU CAN USE THAT TO RETRAIN PEOPLE TO BECOME PAR LEGALS OR RECEPTIONISTS, TO TO BECOME A PARALEGAL AT A LAW OFFICE. YOU CAN CREATE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE AND OTHER WORK EXPERIENCE TO BECOME A WELDER OR SOMEONE THAT WORKS IN FACTORY. >> WHAT ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS, WHERE THEY'RE UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERRESOURCED AND THERE AREN'T TEACHERS TO TRAIN SCIENCE AND MATH? MR. RUBIO: THE K-12 EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS A PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF THE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT. WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GETS INVOLVED ON OCCASION IS HELPING KEY SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION THROUGH FUNDING MECHANISMS, THROUGH THE TITLE 1 PROGRAMS, THROUGH HEAD START AND SO FORTH. MY ARGUMENT IS NOT TO CUT THOSE PROGRAMS. MIERING ARGUMENT IS THAT MONEY SHOULD -- MY ARGUMENT IS THAT MONEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE CHILD, NOT THE CHILD HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MONEY. I WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THAT MONEY TO ACCESS INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I TALKED ABOUT OPENING UP PELL GRANT TO DUAL ENROLLMENT. AT THE FRONT END I BELIEVE THAT PRE-K THROUGH 12 EDUCATION SHOULD REMAIN IN THE CONTROL OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. >> WHAT YOU COULD YOU DOZEN DO AS PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THERE'S -- WHAT COULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THERE'S MORE FUNDING FOR SCIENCE AND MATH? MR. RUBIO: I BELIEVE THAT K-12 EDUCATION BELONGS IN THEA AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. BOTH IN ITS RESPONSIBILITY AND ITS FUNDING. IT'S NEVER BEEN A FEDERAL OBLIGATION. YOU DON'T WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DICTATING THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THAT MONEY WILL ALWAYS COME WITH STRINGS. AND I WANT THE -- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL. YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET THE CREATION OF NEW PROGRAMS AND APPROACHES AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THAT'S WHERE K-12EDCATION PRIMARILY BELONGS. QUESTIONER:KY RESPOND? >> WE WANT TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. QUESTIONER: WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS. THERE'S A LIMIT TO REEDUCATING THESE PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE OLDER. USING THE -- DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR THESE PEOPLE AND CREATE A SAFETY NET? MR. RUBIO: YES. I BELIEVE IN A SAFETY NET. I DON'T THINK FREE ENTERPRISE WORKS WITHOUT A SAFETY NEFMENT FREE ENTERPRISE REQUIRES YOU TO TAKE A RISK IN MANY INSTANCES. IF IT FAILS, THE CONSEQUENCES CAN'T BE THAT YOU'RE DESTITUTE. I DON'T THINK THE SAFETY NET SHOULD BE A LIFE STAPLE OR WAY OF LIFE. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD TAKE OUR -- NUMBER TWO, I THINK OUR SAFETY NET IS FAILING IT. DOESN'T CURE POVERTY. THE PURPOSE OF OUR ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM SHOULD BE TO CURE PROPERTY, NOT TO TREAT ITS SYMPTOMS. THAT'S WHAT OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS HAVE BECOME. A BETTER APPROACH IS THE ONE I'VE ARGUED WHICH IS WE SHOULD TAKE OUR FEDERAL POVERTY MONEY AND ALLOW THEM TO BE SPENT AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL SO THEY CAN DESIGN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET THE CAUSES OR THE LEADING CAUSES OF THAT POVERTY IN THAT COMMUNITY. THE ONLY REQUIREMENT THAT I WOULD HAVE, UNLESS SOMEONE IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED AND LEGITIMATELY DISABLED, THE ONLY REQUIREMENT I WOULD HAVE IS THAT ANYONE WHO IS RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE WORKING OR GOING TO SCHOOL AND SO ANY SOLUTION TO POVERTY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING IT. HAS TO INVOLVE -- NOT JUST PAYING THEIR BILLS IN THE SHORT TERM, IT ALSO HAS TO INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF THE SKILLS KNEW TOAD BECOME EMPLOYABLE AND FIND A JOB -- SKILLS YOU NEED TO BECOME EMPLOYED AND FIND A JOB THAT PAYS MORE. I'VE ALSO ARGUED FOR A WAGE ENHANCEMENT CREDIT. WHICH WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL THAT ONLY MAKES $8 AN HOUR TO RECEIVE AN EXTRA $4 AN HOUR BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY'RE WORKING. THEY'RE NOT HOME UNEMPLOYED. NOW THAT BECOMES A STIGMA ON YOUR RESUME WHEN YOU GET HIRED YEARS LATER. THE LONGER YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED THE HARDER IT IS TO GET RE-EMPLOYED AGAIN. WE'VE OFFERED A NUM NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH. THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S A OBLIGATION ULTIMATELY IS TO CREATE SYSTEMS WHERE INDIVIDUALS WILL FALL ON HARD TIMES, CAN GET BACK UP AND TRY AGAIN. WE DON'T WANT -- WHAT CAN CANNOT BECOME IS WHAT IT IS NOW WHICH IS IN SOME CASES A LIFESTYLE AND IN OTHER CASES A SYSTEM THAT TRAPS YOU. IT MAKES YOU COMFORTABLE IN YOUR POSTBUT IT DOES NOTHING TO CURE IT. WE NEED TO CURE POVERTY. WE'RE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW. QUESTIONER: THANK YOU FOR YOUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION. I AM A TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION ENTREPRENEUR AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT SOMETIMES STARTUPS HAVE TROUBLE FINDING THE RIGHT TALENT TO FILL POSITIONS. OUR LOCAL UNIVERSITIES DO A PRETTY DECENT JOB TRAINING A LOT OF FOREIGN-IMPORTANT STUDENTS. SOME OF WHOM ARE UNDOCUMENTED, LIKE I HAVE BEEN SINCE THE FIRST GRADE. SO AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO HELP FOREIGN-BORN STUDENTS AND DREAMERS LIKE ME WHO WANT TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY, WHO WANT TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY? MR. RUBIO: I BELIEVE WE NEED TO PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT IN ONE MASSIVE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE REASON WHY I KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE I TRIED. WE DON'T HAVE THE VOTES. WE DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL SUPPORT. IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN HARDER TO DO IT THAT WAY. I THINK THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IS TO SAY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE 11 MILLION OR 12 MILLION PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY, WE HAVE TO STOP THE PROBLEM FROM CONTINUING TO GROW FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. SO STEP ONE HAS TO BE TO PROVE THAT WE'VE BROUGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MOVING FORWARD UNDER CONTROL. STEP TWO IS WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE OUR LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S MORE MERIT-BASED AND REFLECTS 291ST CENTURY. . I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE REASONABLE INCLUDING THE MAJORITY WOULD BE REASONABLE HOW YOU DEAL WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS BROUGHT HERE AS A CHILD WHO ISN'T A CRIMINAL, IF THEY'RE A CRIMINAL, THEY CANNOT STAY, BUT THEY ARE NOT A CRIMINAL, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH SOMEONE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. AND DEPENDING ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU HAVE TO COME FORWARD AND PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK AND BECOME PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH, START PAYING TAXES AND YOU GET A WORK PERMIT. A LEGAL STATUS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS. AFTER THAT PERIOD HAS EXPIRED I'M OPEN TO HAVING PEOPLE APPLY FOR A PERMANENT RESIDENCY. THAT WOULD HAVE MAJORITY SUPPORT IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THAT IS THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT. WE HAVE 12 MILL YOP HERE, IF WE DO IT THE WRONG WAY, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER 12 MILLION. AUDIENCE MEMBER: YES. TO BRING BACK YOUR REFRIGERATOR EXAMPLE, WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THE RIGHT TO REPAIR? JOHN DEERE PROHIBITS ONLY AUTHORIZED DEALERS TO REPAIR THINGS. SAME THING FOR APPLE. >> YOU LOSE YOUR WARRANTY. AUDIENCE MEMBER: THERE ARE RESTRICTIVE TERMS OF SERVICE, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU BROUGHT THE WRONG BRAND OF REFRIGERATOR. MANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE BUILDING SMALL REPAIR BUSINESSES, BUT IN TERMS OF SERVICES AND POLICIES OF THE MANUFACTURERS DON'T ALLOW THIRD PARTIES TO REPAIR. SENATOR RUBIO: I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IN DEPTH SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU A GREAT ANSWER. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT INNOVATION AND THESE SORTS OF SERVICES, THESE ARE THE ISSUES WE WILL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. ANY ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION, WHETHER TO THE WORK FORCE OR ISSUES LIKE YOU HAVE RAISED AND WE'LL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THESE. YOU CANNOT STAND IN THE WAY OF IT AND SAY HE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THE THINGS WERE. THAT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ONE. DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE SEAMLESS. I'M SURE WE CAN WORK THROUGH MANY OF THESE, BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DO SO. THIS IS THE U.S. ECONOMY AND ONLY GOING TO CHANGE FASTER THAN EVER AND WE NEED TO ADJUST TO IT QUICKLY. HOST: JUST DISCOVERED A NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT TERMS OF SERVICE. SENATOR RUBIO: ABSOLUTELY. SO IS YOUR REFRIGERATOR WORKING NOW? SENATOR RUBIO: I BOUGHT A NEW ONE. HOST: I HAVE A SITUATION, HE SAID KEEP THE OLD ONE AND WE'LL SEND YOU A NEW ONE, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. SENATOR RUBIO: THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE REFRIGERATOR I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT. HOST: THANK OUR SENATOR FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. [APPLAUSE] . [CAPTIONS",2015-11-07 18:01:11,2015-10-06,New York,New York

THE FLORIDA SENATOR SPOKE IN NEW YORK CITY TODAY TO MEMBERS OF THE TECH COMMUNITY ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACING BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF OUTDATED GOVERNMENT POLICIES. THIS IS ABOUT 50 MINUTES. MR. >> GOOD MORNING. WELCOME. FOR THOSE OF HOW HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE, CIVIC HALL IS A COMMUNITY CENTER AND EVENT SPACE FOCUSED ON CIVIC INNOVATION AND A COLLABORATIVE WORKSPACE FOR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. IT'S WITH GREAT PLEASURE TODAY THAT WE'RE ABLE TO HOST THIS EVENT AND SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM FLORIDA AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 2016, SENATOR MARCO RUBIO. [APPLAUSE] MR. RUBIO: THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS -- A LITTLE LOUD. IS THAT BETTER? SO I'M HERE TODAY NOT TO JUST TELL YOU MY IDEAS, BUT TO LISTEN TO YOURS. I THINK THAT THE BIG PART OF WHAT A CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT IS THE LISTENING PART. NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEEDS OF THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY AS WELL AS THOSE OF WHO YOU ARE BUILDING IT. COMING INTO THE DISCUSSION, HERE'S SOMETHING I CAN STATE TO YOU WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE. IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT MATTERS IN THE 21ST CENTURY, IT'S INNOVATION. IN ORDER TO BE THE LEADING ECONOMY ON EARTH, AMERICA MUST BE THE MOST INNOVATIVE ECONOMY ON EARTH. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT INNOVATION, WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PROBLEM SOLVING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FINDING WAYS TO DO THINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY, MORE AFFORDABLY AND MORE CONVENIENTLY THAN EVER BEFORE. I WANT TO BEGIN BY TELLING YOU ABOUT A PROBLEM THAT I HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT AMERICAN INNOVATORS, INCLUDING MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM, ARE ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE. AND THEN I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW. WHICH IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS OFTEN GETTING IN THE WAY OF SOLVING IT. SO MY PROBLEM WAS THIS. A FEW MONTHS AGO MY REFRIGERATOR AT MY HOME BROKE IT. JUST STOPPED WORKING IT. DIED OUNLS. WITH FOUR GROWING KIDS HOME FOR SUMMER BREAK IN FLORIDA, YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS FACING SOME PRESSURE TO GET IT FIXED. SO I GOOGLED APPLIANCE REPAIR COMPANIES IN MIAMI AND I MADE SOME CALLS. FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS FRUSTRATINGLY DIFFICULT TO GET ANYONE TO TAKE ME OFF HOLD OR EVEN TO CALL ME BACK. WHEN I FINALLY GOT IN TOUCH WITH A REAL PERSON THEY SAID, NO PROBLEM, WE CAN HAVE SOMEONE OUT TO YOUR HOUSE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO LOOK AT IT. THAT JUST CAN'T BE HOW OUR ECONOMY WORKS IN THE YEAR 2015. OTHER THINGS THAT TOOK THREE DAYS IN THE OLD ECONOMY NOW TAKE THREE MINUTES OR THREE SECONDS. WHAT STRUCK ME IN THAT MOMENT WAS THE FOLLOWING REALIZATION. INEVITABLY, SOMEWHERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM ME, THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS CAPABLE OF REPAIRING APPLIANCES, SOMEONE WHO IS JUST AS EAGER TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY THAT DAY AS I WAS EAGER TO HAVE A FUNCTIONAL REFRIGERATOR. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THIS PERSON AND I HAD NO WAY OF FINDING EACH OTHER OR CONNECTING. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WILL NOT EXIST WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO. AT LEAST NOT IF AMERICAN INNOVATORS HAVE THEIR WAY. THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY. THIS IS A REVOLUTION THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE OUR ISLES. ALSO KNOWN AS THE SHARING ECONOMY OR THE GIG ECONOMY. THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY IS ALLOWING MILLIONS OF PROFESSIONALS ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES TO CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH CONSUMERS. THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLES, FOLKS, ARE COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND AIRBNB. LAST WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT AMAZON AND GOOGLE WOULD BE ENTERING THE ON-DEMAND MARKET. RIGHT BEHIND THESE GIANTS ARE THOUSANDS OF SMALL INNOVATIVE STARTUPS AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THEM YET, JUST WAIT. THE ON-DEMAND PLATFORM IS ONE EXAMPLE OF AN IMPORTANT TRUTH FACING US IN THIS ELECTION. WHICH IS THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, AS THE GLOBAL ONE, IS FUNDAMENTALLY BEING TRANSFORMED. UBER DIDN'T EVEN EXIST WHEN OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE. AND TODAY IT IS WORTH OVER $51 BILLION. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMY IS CHANGING. THE FACT IS THAT THE ECONOMY IS CHANGING FASTER THAN IT HAS EVER CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, IT TOOK THE TELEPHONE 75 YEARS TO REACH 100 MILLION USERS. IT TOOK CANDY CRUSH ONE YEAR TO REACH 100 MILLION USERS. AND YET WHILE OUR ECONOMY IS CHANGING AND CHANGING FAST, OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS POLICIES ARE NOT. QUITE FRANKLY, BOTH PARTIES ARE TO BLAME. NEVER BEFORE, AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME, HAS THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT IN THIS COUNTRY BEEN MORE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAN IT IS TODAY. THE RESULT IS A WORSENING FRICTION BETWEEN OUR 20TH CENTURY GOVERNMENT AND OUR RAPIDLY CHANGING 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY. AND NOWHERE IS THAT FRICTION MORE APPARENT THAN IN THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY. HERE YOU HAVE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES WHO ARE RUNNING UP AGAINST AN ANTIQUATED TAX CODE, BURDENSOME REGULATION AND NUMEROUS, NUMEROUS OUTDATED POLITICIANS. THAT'S NOT ALL. THE COMPANIES ARE ALSO VICTIMS OF A COORDINATED ATTACK FROM ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES WHICH INFLUENCE THE POLITICAL PROCESS TO PASS NEW REGULATIONS THAT BLOCK COMPETITION. WE'VE SEEN THIS PLAY OUT WITH TAXI COMPANIES LOBBYING TO STOP UBER AND HERE IN NEW YORK THE GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING MILLIONS TO TRY AND STOP AIRBNB FROM THREATENING HOTEL CHAINS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE TODAY. I WANT TO TELL BUT A GROWING COMPANY BASED RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK THAT, LIKE ALL BUSINESSES IN THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY, IS FACING UNNECESSARY CHALLENGES. AS A RESULT OF THE OUTDATED GOVERNMENT. IT'S A COMPANY CALLED HANDY. AND ITS C.E.O. IS HERE TODAY. HANDY IS A ONLINE PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH HOME CLEANERS, HANDYMEN, PLUMBERS AND OTHER HOME SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. IT'S QUICKLY GROWING, IT'S NOW OPERATING IN 37 CITIES WITH OVER 11,000 PROFESSIONAL AS REGISTERED TO USE THE PLATFORM. HANDY IS GROWN BREAKING FOR CONSUMERS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. IT PROVIDES SIMPLE BOOKING AT THE TAP OF A FINGER, A RATING AND REVIEW PROCESS THAT HELPS PEOPLE FIND THE BEST CONTRACTOR FOR THEIR NEEDS, AND AN EASY ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES HAGGLING OVER PRICES. BUT IT ISN'T JUST GREAT FOR CONSUMERS. ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE MOST ABOUT THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY IS THE WAY IT PROMOTES UPWARD MOBILITY FOR THE PROFESSIONALS WHO USE IT. THROUGH HANDY, WORKERS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO START THEIR OWN CLEANING BUSINESS, THEY CAN NOW HAVE ALL THE INDEPENDENCE OF SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND THE CUSTOMER BASE OF A LARGE ESTABLISHED BUSINESS. PROFESSIONALS WHO USE HANDY CAN EARN AN AVERAGE OF $18 AN HOUR, WHICH IS MORE THAN THE TYPICAL WORKER IN THE FIELD. BEST OF ALL, THEY SET THEIR OWN HOURS. CHECKING INTO THE APP WHENEVER THEY HAVE TIME TO TAKE ON A JOB AND SIGNING OUT WHEN THEY HAVE OTHER OBLIGATIONS. MANY WORKERS USE THIS FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION, WHICH IS CENTRAL TO UPWARD MOBILITY IN THIS NEW CENTURY. OTHERS USE IT TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN OR WORK OTHER JOBS. INNOVATIONS LIKE HANDY ARE PART OF THE REASON WHY I'M SO OPTIMISTIC, NOT ONLY ABOUT SAVING THE AMERICAN DREAM IN THIS CENTURY, BUT ACTUALLY ABOUT EXPANDING IT. TO REACH MORE PEOPLE AND CHANGE MORE LIVES THAN EVER BEFORE. IN THE LAST CENTURY, MY MOTHER WORKED AS A MAID IN HOTELS. SHE HAD NO CONTROL OVER HER SCHEDULE. NO INFLUENCE OVER HOW MUCH SHE EARNED. AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SET HERSELF APART. AND YET SHE ACHIEVED THE AMERICAN DREAM. JUST THINK WHAT SHE COULD HAVE ACHIEVED CLEANING HOMES THROUGH A COMPANY LIKE HANDY. SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TOTAL CONTROL OVER HER OWN FINANCIAL LIFE. THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY IS A MIRACLE THAT ONLY AMERICAN FREE ENTERPRISE COULD PRODUCE. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO SHAMEFUL SHAT -- THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO THE GROWTH OF THIS PLATFORM IS OUR VERY OWN GOVERNMENT. IN FACT, THINK ABOUT THIS. I MET THE C.E.O. OF AN ON-DEMAND STARTUP A FEW WEEKS AGO AND HE ASKED ME NOT TO MENTION HIS BUSINESS TODAY OUT OF FEAR, OUT OF FEAR THAT HE WOULD ATTRACT ATTENTION FROM LEGISLATORS, FROM LAWYERS AND FROM COMPETITORS. WHAT DOES THIS SAY? DO WE WANT AMERICA TO BE A PLACE WHERE HONEST, INNOVATIVE BUSINESSES HAVE TO HIDE THEIR SUCCESS? OF COURSE WE DO NOT. WE NEED TO BE THE MOST BUSINESS FRIENDLY ECONOMY ON EARTH. BUT RIGHT NOW WITH THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD AND A REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT'S DIRECTLY HOSTILE TO INNOVATION, THAT'S QUITE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. HERE ARE SOME OF THE OBSTACLES THAT HANDY AND COMPANIES LIKE IT FACE EVERY DAY. FIRST, AN OUTDATED TAX CODE. COMPANIES LIKE HANDY HAVE ONLY TWO OPTIONS FOR HOW TO CLASSIFY THEIR PROFESSIONALS WHO UTILIZE THEIR SERVICES. THEY CAN EITHER BE CLASSIFIED AS FULL W-2 EMPLOYEES OR THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS 1099 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. BUT NEITHER ONE OF THESE MAKES PERFECT SENSE. IF HANDY'S C.E.O. CLASSIFIES THE WORKERS AS W-2 EMPLOYEES, THEN MUCH OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT MAKES WORKING WITH HANDY SO APPEALING WOULD DISAPPEAR. HE'D HAVE TO REGULATE THE WORKERS' HOURS AND HE'D HAVE TO COMPLY WITH A LITANY OF EXPENSIVE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD STUNT THE GROWTH OF THE COMPANY. SO INSTEAD THE C.E.O. MAKES SURE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP COMPLIES WITH THE 1099 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS. BUT THIS CAUSES OTHER COMPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY CAN'T PROVIDE TRAINING TO ITS CONTRACTORS. THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE RECOMMENDATION AS TO THEM BASED ON CUSTOMER FEEDBACK. THEY CAN'T EVEN ASK THEM TO WEAR A SHIRT OR UNIFORM WITH A HANDY LOGO ON IT. THE C.E.O. IS ALSO PREVENTED FROM PROVIDING THE PERKS AND BENEFITS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ATTRACT MORE HIGH QUALITY PROFESSIONALS TO THE PLATFORM. THINK ABOUT HOW AROONIC THAT IS. -- IRONIC THAT IS. OUR OUTDATED POLITICIANS BASH THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY FOR NOT TAKING BETTER CARE OF WORKERS YET OUR OUTDATED GOVERNMENT IS THE EXACT FORCE PRI PRESENTING IT FROM DOING -- PREVENTING IT FROM DOING SO. THAT'S WHY I'VE PROPOSED A COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM PLAN THAT IS BOTH PRO-GROWTH AND PRO-FAMILY AND TODAY I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH ALL OF A YOU SOME ADDITIONAL WAYS TO MAKE THE TAX CODE MORE WELCOMING TO ON-DEMAND COMPANIES. SOME IDEAS I'VE HAD ARE TO MAINTAIN THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE STANDARD FOR TAXATION A, FOR ONLINE PURCHASES. TO STOP DISCRIMINATORY TAXATION OF DIGITAL GOODS AND SERVICES LIKE APP DOWNLOADS AND TO ENSURE THAT THE INTERNET REMAINS TAX-FREE. BUT ON-DEMAND COMPANIES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES HURT BY OUR TAX CODE. THEY ALSO FACE THE UNCERTAINTY OF A VOLATILE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. JUST LAST WEEK, LAST FRIDAY ACTUALLY, THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SAID THAT THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY WOULD REQUIRE, QUOTE, TARGETED REGULATORY MEASURES, UNQUOTE. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT ALL THE BEST INNOVATION IN OUR ECONOMY IS HAPPENING IN THE UNREGULATED SPACE. YET WASHINGTON HAS IMPOSED 60,000 PAGES OF NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS JUST THIS YEAR, COSTING OUR PRIVATE ECONOMY ALMOST -- OVER OR ALMOST $70 BILLION IN TOTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS. AS PRESIDENT I WILL PUT AN END TO THIS. I WILL PLACE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF REGULATIONS -- ON THE AMOUNT REGULATIONS CAN COST OUR ECONOMY EACH YEAR. I WILL ALSO REQUIRE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD IMPACT COMPETITION AND OVATION. I BELIEVE THE MORE AMERICA REGULAR LATE -- REGULATES, THE MORE WE CREATE AN OPENING FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO DEREGULATE AND DRAW JOBS AWAY FROM OUR SHORES. OTHER NATIONS ARE ALREADY SCRAMBLING TO KATER TO THE ON-DEMAND ECONOMY. GERMANY, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS CREATED A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THIS CLASSIFICATION IS CALLED DEPEND CONTRACTORS -- DEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. IT ALLOWS PROFESSIONALS TO WORK FOR A SICKLE COMPANY, RECEIVE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS AND YET RETAIN CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN WORK. WHETHER THIS MODEL IS THE BEST OPTION FOR AMERICA OR NOT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT. BUT HERE'S WHAT I KNOW FOR SURE. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT IN THIS COUNTRY THINKS ABOUT THE NEW ECONOMY. RIGHT NOW THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE NEW ECONOMY DOESN'T FIT OUR CURRENT TAX CODE AND OUR CURRENT WAY OF DOING THINGS, SO THEY ASK THEMSELVES, HOW CAN WE FORCE THE NEW ECONOMY TO AA DAPT TO OUR OLD POLICIES -- TO ADOPT TO OUR POLE, OLD POLICIES RATHER THAN ASKING, HOW CAN WE CHANGE OUR OLD POLICIES TO ADAPT TO THE NEW ECONOMY? THIS HAS ALWAYS -- THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE AMERICAN WAY. WE ARE A UNIQUE NATION IN ALL THE WORLD'S HISTORY. A NATION FOUNDED ON THE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GET TO CHOOSE WHAT OUR ECONOMY LOOKS LIKE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR GET TO CHOOSE. AND GUESS WHAT? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN. THEY HAVE CHOSEN A CONVENIENT, FAST, TECH-DRIVEN ECONOMY, ONE WITH DIRECT LANE OF AC A SESS TO THE PRODUCT AND THE SERVICES THEY WANT AND NEED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN AN ECONOMY IN WHICH THE MOST VALUABLE RETAILER IN AMERICA, AMAZON, DOESN'T OWN A SINGLE STORE. THEY HAVE CHOSEN WHERE THE LARGEST TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, UBER, DOESN'T OWN A SINGLE VEHICLE. AND WHERE THE LARGEST ACCOMMODATION PROVIDER, AIRBNB, DOES NOT OWN A SINGLE HOTEL. FREE ENTERPRISE HAS BROUGHT US THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND FREE ENTERPRISE WILL BRING US EVEN MORE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD. IN FACT, I BELIEVE FREE ENTERPRISE WILL WORK BETTER IN THIS CENTURY THAN IT DID IN THE LAST CENTURY. BECAUSE THE NEW ECONOMY IS ALL ABOUT INNOVATION, CREATIVITY AND PRODUCTIVITY AND WE AMERICANS ARE THE MOST INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE ON THE EARTH. I BELIEVE THE 21ST CENTURY NOT ONLY CAN BE THE AMERICAN CENTURY, I BELIEVE IT WILL BE THE AMERICAN CENTURY. IT WILL BE AS LONG AS EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KEEPS DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND AS LONG AS WE CAN GET WASHINGTON TO STOP DOING WHAT ITS DOING AND START LOOKING FOR A BETTER WAY. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR IDEAS AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU FOR THE TUNAL OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> WE'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION. I'LL START. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION YOU'D LIKE TO ASK, IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES, THERE ARE TWO MICROPHONES IN THE AISLES. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BASED ON ANALITY AER NATING BETWEEN, SO I'LL GIVE YOU A SIGNAL WHEN WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE QUESTIONS. SENATOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO CIVIC HALL AND FOR TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF CASES WHERE INCUMBENT MARKET FORCES WHO HAVE POLITICAL INFLUENCE HAVE REACTED TO THE COMPETITION THAT THE SHARING ECONOMY COMPANIES ARE GIVING THEM. AND A THEY'RE USING THEIR POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO TRY AND STOP THESE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES. THIS IS ALL EVENTUALLY TIED TO MONEY AND POLITICS. IT'S GREAT, AND I HEAR YOU WHEN YOU SAY THAT GOVERNMENT IS TARGETING, BUT IF YOU FOLLOW THE MONEY, IT GOES BACK TO THE INCUMBENT MARKET. HOW DO YOU BREAK THAT CYCLE? MR. RUBIO: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. I THINK PART OF IT IS TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT EXPERIENCING AN ECONOMIC DOWN TURN. WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MASS OF ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING. IT'S LIKE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION HAPPENING EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO OUR POLICIES NEED TO REFLECT THAT. AND IN REFLECTING THAT, THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO ASCRIBE TO THE NEW ECONOMY ATTRIBUTES OF THE OLD ECONOMY. SO THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE A LIMITED GOVERNMENT IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. THE LARGER THE GOVERNMENT, THE MORE POWERFUL THE GOVERNMENT IS, THE MORE INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS OVER THE ECONOMY, THE MORE THE PEOPLE OR THE COMPANIES THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT WIN AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYBODY ELSE. SO YOU HAVE MASSIVE -- THAT'S WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORY BUDGET IS SO IMPORTANT. THE FAVORITE WAY OF ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES TO BLOCK AN INNOVATIVE COMPETITOR IS TO CREATE A REGULATORY IMPEDIMENT TO THAT COMPETITOR, TO ENTER THE SPACE. I ALWAYS USE THIS EXAMPLE, IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT, BUT IMAGINE A BLOCK BUST VOOR, IF YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND THIS ROOM, SOME OF YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, A BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO HAD CONVINCED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PASS A REGULATION SAYING, IN ORDER TO RENT MOVIES YOU MUST COME INTO A PHYSICAL STORE AND SHOW YOUR I.D. BUZZ WE WANT TO PREVENT UNDERAGE KIDS FROM RENTING RATED R MOVIE, THEY'D STILL BE IN BUSINESS AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE DOWNLOADING. THAT'S THE MENTALITY THAT EXISTS IN ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES. THEY FIND SOME SORT OF ARGUMENT AND THEY USE IT TO CREATE A ROAD BLOCK THAT THE INNOVATOR CAN'T MEET. >> THE REASON THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND CREATE THAT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS AND THAT ACCESS IS TIED TO GIVING MONEY TO POLITICAL DAND DATE CONSCIOUS CANDIDATES OR OFFICIALS. MR. RUBIO: PART OF IT IS ELECTING PEOPLE WHO WON'T FALL FOR THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S AN IMPEDIMENT TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT'S WHY THE REGULATORY BUDGET IS ONE OF THE PROPOSAL AS I HAVE. >> YESTERDAY A NEW REPORT CAME OUT FROM THE FREELANCERS UNION THAT STATES THAT 54 MILLION AMERICAN, ALMOST 1/3 OF THE WORK FORCE, IS DOING FREELANCE WORK. IT'S NOT JUST IN URBAN AREAS, IT'S IN RURAL AREAS, THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 86% OF THE NATION'S FREELANCERS ARE LIKELY TO VOTE IN 2016. 62% ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE WHO SUPPORTS FREELANCERS' INTERESTS. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY WORKING FOR HANDY OR FOR UBER OR ANY OF THE SHARING COMPANIES, THEY'RE JUST WORKING ON THEIR OWN BUT THEY CARE ABOUT THINGS LIKE RETIREMENT SAVINGS, HEALTH CARE, LEGAL SUPPORT FOR NONPAYMENT BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S NOT PAYING THEM. AND OTHER ISSUES UNIQUE TO THIS GROUP. WHATEVER A WORKER REALLY WANTS IS FLEXIBLE WORK BUT ALSO STABLE WORK. WHAT WOULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT -- MR. RUBIO: YOU RAISE A COUPLE OF INTERESTING POINTS. OUR 21ST CENTURY HEALTH CARE IS ON THE WORKER MODEL. WE WORK FOR SOMEBODY, THOSE PEOPLE OFFER YOU AN INSURANCE PLAN, THAT'S HOW YOU GET YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE. IN THE 2169 CENTURY, THAT CANNOT BE THE CORNER STONE OF OUR SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PORTABLE SYSTEM OF HEALTH INSURANCE, WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTROL THEIR OWN PRETAX HEALTH CARE MONEY, WHETHER IT'S AN EMPLOYER THAT GIVES IT TO YOU, WHETHER IT'S YOUR OWN MONEY OR A TAX A CREDIT. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE, AND YOU CAN USE IT TO BUY YOUR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE FROM ANY COMPANY THAT WILL SELL IT TO YOU. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'VE ARGUED WE SHOULD OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL RETIREMENT PLAN. THE CONGRESS, AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEDERAL 2015 SAVINGS PLAN. THAT'S ONLY AVAILABLE TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND IT'S A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY PERFORMS WELL. I'VE ARGUED WE SHOULD OPEN UP THAT PLAN TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE A RETIREMENT PLAN OFFERED TO THEM BY AN EMPLOYER. SO THEY TOO CAN PAY INTO AND HAVE ACCESS TO CONGRESSIONAL RETIREMENT PLAN AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT PROGRAM. I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PROVIDE THAT SORT OF STABILITY, THAT ONCE CAME FROM A TRADITIONAL EMPLOYER. IN THE 21ST CENTURY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF AMERICANS WON'T BE THAT -- BE THAT DRIGSLY EXPLODE -- TRADITIONALLY EMPLOYED. >> YOU CAME OUT AGAINST THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. IN THE SHARING ECONOMY, WHAT'S TO KEEP FROM US HAVING A RACE TO THE BOTTOM? THE PERSON WHO IS WILLING TO DELIVER FOOD FOR $4 IS BEATEN OUT BY THE PERSON WILLING TO DO IT FOR $3 AN HOUR. MR. RUBIO: I'M I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF GETTING RID OF THE MINIMUM WAGE COMPLETELY. I'VE ARGUED AGAINST INCREASING IT FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MACHINES. THE SECOND POINT, IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE ARE BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CANNOT PASS THROUGH THE COST, THAT WILL ADJUST TO A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE BY EITHER HIRING LESS PEOPLE, CUTTING HOURS, CUTTING BENEFITS. AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE HARMED BY. THAT I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY TO RAISE WAGES. I THINK THE BETTER WAY TO RAISE WAGES IS A COMBINATION OF CREATING AN DEME THAT -- AN ECONOMY THAT CREATES JOBS THAT PAY MORE BUT ALSO MAKING IT EASIER AND CHEAPER FOR PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE THE ADVANCED EDUCATION THEY NEED TO QUALIFY FOR THE BEST PAYING JOBS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, I'VE ARGUED ABOUT OPENING SPACE FOR COMPETENCY-BASED LEARNING. IN A BIPARTISAN BILL, WITH MIKE BENNETT OF COLORADO AND MYSELF HAVE OFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITTING MODEL THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET THE EQUIVALENT OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION BUT DO IT BY A MEANS THAT ALLOW YOU TO PACKAGE LEARNING FROM A VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES. WE SHOULD OPEN UP PELL GRANT AND STUDENT FINANCIAL AID TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO DUEL ENROLL. -- DUAL ENROLL. I ALSO THINK WE'LL HAVE TRADITIONAL FOUR-YEAR EDUCATION. BUT I'VE ARGUED THAT STUDENTS DESERVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THAT THANK SCHOOL WITH THAT DEGREE BEFORE THEY BORROW MONEY TO PAY FOR IT. SO I HAVE A BIPARTISAN BILL CALLED RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO WITH RON WHITE OF OREGON THAT THANK REQUIRES THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE OUT A LOAN, YOU ARE TOLD HOW MUCH PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THAT SCHOOL. THAT'S A BETTER WAY TO RAISE WAGES. IS TO BOTH CREATE THE POLICIES THAT ALLOW AMERICA TO BE THE EASIEST AND BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO CREATE BETTER PAYING JOBS AND MAKE IT EASIER, FASTER AND CHEAPER FOR PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE THE SKILLS THEY NEED FOR THOSE BETTER PAYING JOBS. >> YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANT TO LIMIT REGULATION BUT IN SOME CASES THESE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES HAVE FANTASTIC SERVICES BUT THERE ARE COLLATERAL EFFECTS. FOR EXAMPLE, AIRBNB, WHICH MANY PEOPLE LOVE, BOTH THE USERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TRANSACTION LOVE, BUT IN SOME CASES LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE USING AIRBNB TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR INCOMES. THEIR LANDLORDS ARE FINDING OUT, THEY'RE GETTING EVICTED. THE LANDLORD TAKES THAT APARTMENT TO MARKET RENT. LOW INCOME HOUSING DROPS. THERE'S A COLLATERAL EFFECT. YOU CAN PROBABLY FOLLOW A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES' PATH AND START SEEING A WAKE OF COLLATERAL EFFECT WHICH MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE SO GREAT, SO IF YOU HAVE NO REGULATION, HOW DO YOU PREVENT COLLATERAL EFFECTS FROM COMING BACK AND BITING US? MR. RUBIO: I WANT THE WE -- I WANT THE WATER WE DRINK TO NOT BE POISONED. I FLY ON PLANES, I'M GLAD THEY'RE REGULATED. I'M ARGUING THERE COMES A POINT WHEN REGULATIONS GO TOO FAR AND THEY BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT TO INNOVATION. IN THE CASE OF A PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER, IF I'M A PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER, I OWN MY OWN PROPERTY, I CAN PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON HOW TENANTS CAN USE PROPERTY. PEOPLE DO THAT ALL THE TIME. THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM A GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT PLACES THAT RESTRICTION ARTIFICIALLY, AS OPPOSED TO A CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTION. THAT'S A SITUATION YOU'RE FACING. STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN DISRUPTIVE. THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS DEEPLY DISRUPTIVE. WE HAD TO WORK THROUGH ISSUES OF CHILD LABOR AND SAFETY ISSUES AT FACTORIES THAT WE NEVER HAD BEFORE AS A SOCIETY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DISRUPTIONS WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WALK AWAY FROM THIS. THIS IS THE FUTURE. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO THE 20TH CENTURY. THE ONLY CHOICE BEFORE US IS DO WE EMBRACE THE FUTURE, HARNESS ITS PROMISE OR ALLOW IT TO LEAVE US BEHIND. THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE BEFORE US. THIS ARGUE AMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS OR THE WAY THINGS ONCE WERE IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IF WE DO WE'RE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND BY THE FEWER. >> SHARING ECONOMY HAS BECOME A BUZZ TERM. BUT DOESN'T FULLY EXPLAIN THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK IN AMERICA. COMPANIES LIKE AIRBNB AND LIFT AND UBER ARE EXAMPLES, AND EVEN HANDY, ARE MIDDLEMEN IN EFFECT BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO PROVIDE A SERVICE AND SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. WOULDN'T WE BE BETTER OFF JUST BUILDING COOPERATIVES WHERE THE PEOPLE CAN FIND EACH OTHER WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY A MIDDLEMAN TO DO THE TRANSACTION? BECAUSE ONCE YOU BUILD THAT PLATFORM -- MR. RUBIO: WHO'S GOING TO BUILD THAT PLATFORM? THE GOVERNMENT? >> CITIZENS COULD DO IT AND A MAKE IT MORE OPEN SO THE SHARE HOLD, -- MR. RUBIO: I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET INNOVATION THAT WAY. THE WAY YOU COME UP WITH GREAT IDEAS IS SOMEONE SAYS, I HAVE A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK I CAN MAKE MONEY ON, IT I'M GOING TO DO IT. EVERY MAJOR INNOVATION IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN DRISK THAN WAY. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING CERTAINS TO INDIVIDUALS. YOU MAY BELIEVE IN YOUR IDEA, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE REASON WHY IT'S CREATED IS BECAUSE THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE. SOMEBODY HAS MADE A DECISION, I THINK I CAN DO THIS FOR A LIVING AND SO THEY FOUND THESE IDEAS. I THINK IF YOU'RE COUNTING ON THE COLLECTIVE TO COME UP WITH IT ON ITS OWN, THE NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO MOVE INNOVATION. FREE ENTERPRISE HAS PROVEN THAT. THE GREAT COMPANY OF THE YEAR 2025 DOESN'T EXIST YET. SOMEONE IS PROBABLY 14 YEARS OLD PLAYING MINE CRAFT RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT -- THEY SHOULDN'T BE PLAYING RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THIS THING TOGETHER IN EIGHT OR NINE YEARS. BUT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE MONEY DOING IT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROFIT MOTIVE INVOLVED IN DRIVING THESE. >> FOSOME PEOPLE ARGUE THERE ARE NEW MONOPOLIES BEING CREATED BY NEW TECH COMPANIES NOW THAT ARE WILL PREVENT INNOVATION. MR. RUBIO: YOU CAN VERY MUCH BE A CREATURE OF THE NEW ECONOMY AND ONCE YOU ARE ESTABLISHED DECIDE YOU'RE AN INCUMBENT INDUSTRY. EVERY ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY WAS ONCE AN INNOVATOR. I'M NOT ARGUE AING THAT NEW ECONOMY CREATURES ARE GOING TO NOT BEHAVE IN THE SAME FASHION EVENTUALLY. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE IS A FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM THAT SAYS THIS NO MATTER HOW GREAT YOUR IDEA, IS YOU CAN BE OUT OF BUSINESS IN TWO YEARS IF SOMEONE COMES UP WITH A BETTER SERVICE, A BETTER IDEA AND CAN DELIVER IT AT A BETTER PRICE. >> WHAT IF A COMPANY LIKE UBER, FOR EXAMPLE, DECIDES TO CUT ITS PRICES BECAUSE IT CAN AFFORD TO AND PREVENT OTHERS IN COMPANY THAT MAY WANT TO CREATE CAR SHARING IN A DIFFERENT WAY, LIKE CAR POOLING, FROM EVEN BEING ABLE TO ENTER THE MARKET? THERE'S NO ONE TO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE THE FIRST MOVER MADE A HUGE ADVANTAGE AND GOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND NOW THEY'RE BURNING MONEY IN ORDER TO PROTECT -- MR. RUBIO: THE TRUTH ABOUT THE NEW ECONOMY IS THE COMPETITOR TO UBER MAY NOT OFFER A DIRECT EXACT MODEL IT. WON'T BE JUST A CHEAPER VERSION OF UBER. IT WILL BE A NEW SYSTEM OR WAY OF USING SHARING THAT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MODEL UBER IS USING. WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF THIS ALL THE TIME. FIVE YEARS AGO, THREE YEARS AGO, WHATEVER IT MAY BE, THE CUTTING EDGE INDUSTRY OR THE CUTTING EDGE COMPANY OR FIRM HAS VERY MUCH BEEN REPLACED BY A NEW ONE THAT CAME IN AND DID KIND OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING BUT AN EVEN BETTER AND MORE CREATIVE WAY. I DON'T THINK THAT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN THAT REALM IS GOING TO LEAD TO THE SORT OF INNOVATION. WHAT IT'S GOING TO END UP DOING IS SETTING AND CONCRETE AND DRYING THE EXISTING INNOVATION THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. >> YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE A 20TH CENTURY GOVERNMENT BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND CHANGE AND SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE REGULATORS ARE REACTING AS OPPOSED TO STAYING AHEAD. IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT, WHERE IT DOES NEED TO REGULATE, FOR EXAMPLE, AIRLINES, MAKING SURE THEY'RE SAFE, STAYS AHEAD OF THE TECHNOLOGY? PLANES RIT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, AREN'T CONNECTED 24/7, WE STILL CHASE AFTER BLACK BOXING WHEN THEY CRASH. THERE IS A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT TO STAY AHEAD OF TECHNOLOGY. BESIDES JUST CUTTING THE REGULATORS' BUDGET AND LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF REGULATION, HOW DO WE KEEP THE GOVERNMENT ON A 21ST CENTURY PATH. MR. RUBIO: THE GOVERNMENT STILL HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN PUBLIC SAFETY. IF YOU'RE AN UBER -- I KEEP GOING BACK TO THE SAME COMPANIES, I DON'T WANT TO PICK ON ANYBODY. BUT THOSE USUAL CARS ARE REGULATED. BEFORE THAT CAR IS ON THE ROAD IT'S BEEN INSPECTED, GONE THROUGH THE TESTING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES FOR MOTOR VEHICLES. IT HAS REGULATIONS LOCALLY ABOUT HOW FAST YOU CAN DRIVE, WHAT THE SAFETY FEATURES NEED TO BE, RULES OF THE ROAD, ALL THOSE THINGS ARE STILL IN PLACE. WE'RE NOT SAYING UBER DRIVERS DON'T HAVE TO OBSERVE TRAFFIC SIGNALS. THEY STILL HAVE TO FOLLOW ALL OF THOSE RULES. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. THE ISSUE IS THE INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR. IT'S A BUSINESS MODEL NOT BEING REGULATED. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD EVER KEEP UP WITH INNOVATE ON A REGULATORY FRONT IT. CAN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH -- INNOVATION ON A REGULATORY FRONT. IT CAN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH. >> I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REGULATION WHEN VOLKSWAGEN IS ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEIR SOFTWARE AND BASICALLY LIE TO THE WORLD ABOUT THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR CARS. SOMEBODY HAS TO HAVE THE BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T DO THAT. IF YOU CUT REGULATION, IT ISN'T JUST GOING ALLOW FOR INNOVATIVE COMPANIES, IT MAY CREATE DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY. MR. RUBIO: A REGULATORY BUDGET IS NOT JUST ABOUT CUTTING REGULATIONS. A REGULATORY BUDGET IS DESIGNED TO FORCE PRIORITIZATION. THROUGH A COST-BENEFIT ANAL SILLS. ALL IT SAYS IS THAT -- ANALYSIS. ALL IT SAYS IS THAT A CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS CANNOT EXCEED A CERTAIN. A MONEY. THESE AGENCIES MUST DECIDE WHICH REGULATIONS ARE WORTHY. IF WE ONLY CAN HAVE X NUMBER OF REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE THE ONES WE REALLY NEED AND WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT AREN'T JUSTIFIED. THAT'S WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO. >> ON A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS, SOME PEOPLE WITH A SAY GET RID OF GAS EMISSIONS BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER TO MAKE CARS THAT DON'T SAVE AIR POLLUTION. A HUGE COST TO THE ENVIRONMENT. MR. RUBIO: THEN THOSE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THAT DECISION WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR ELECTORATE . WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN KEEP ADD AING NEW REGULATIONS WITHOUT REMOVING EXISTING ONES. IT'S A SYSTEM OF PERPETUAL REGULATORY GROWTH. WITHOUT ANY COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. MANY REGULATIONS ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE BECAUSE OF THE THEORETICAL VALUE OF THE REGULATION OR BECAUSE SOMEONE HIRED THE RIGHT PERSON TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. >> WE'LL START TAKING SOME QUESTIONS. I JUST HAVE ONE MORE. THE WHITE HOUSE RECENTLY LAUNCHED A PROGRAM CALLED THE U.S. DIGITAL SERVICE. WHICH IS TO BRING THE NATION'S TOP ENGINEERS TO WORK INSIDE GOVERNMENT, TO FIX PROBLEMS. FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THE V.A. BACKLOG. AND SAVE MONEY. IN FACT, SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON OLD ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY SPENDS. IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM AND WOULD YOU EXPAND IT? MR. RUBIO: WE WANT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS FIRST. IT'S BEEN OFFERED AS A PILOT INITIALLY. A VERY SMALL AMOUNT. $0 MILLION. BUT I THINK IF IT PROVES TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S EFFECTIVE, WHERE WE CAN ATTRACT SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN THE COUNTRY TO DEDICATE THEMSELVES TO PUBLIC SERVICE FOR X NUMBER OF YEARS, TO CREATE SOLUTIONS TO HOW GOVERNMENT PROVIDES SERVICES, THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE OPEN TO. >> I WANT TO ASK EVERYBODY TO PLEASE HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS REMAIN ON THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S TALK, IF YOU COULD. QUESTIONER: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I VERY MUCH ENJOY YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY. ESPECIALLY YOU MENTIONED THE AMERICAN DREAM. I'M A DACA RECIPIENT. DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVAL. I HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC. I AM IN THE TECH INDUSTRY. YOU'VE SAID OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON WHETHER YOU HAVE A RELATIVE HERE RATHER THAN MARRIED. AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO FIX THE LOTTERY SYSTEM TO ATTRACT AND KEEP THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST TALENT IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY FOR TECH? MR. RUBIO: FIRST OF ALL, DO I BELIEVE WE NEED REFORMS TO. THAT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SOME OF IT IS BEING ABUSED BY EXISTING COMPANIES AND THE OTHER PART OF IT IS SOMETIMES THE VISA, IS WITHIN THREE DAYS ALL THE SLOTS ARE GONE. COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA ARE DELIBERATELY TARGETING TO STEAL AWAY SOME OF THE BEST TALENT GRADUATING FROM OUR UNIVERSITIES BY BRAGGING THAT YOU CAN GET THE WORK FORCE TO LIVE IN CANADA BUT NOT IN THE U.S. I HAVE A PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT EXPANDS THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO CREATES RULES AND REGULATIONS SO IT CAN'T BE ABUSED AND USED AGAINST THE AMERICAN WORKER. BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS ON THE -- WE ADMIT A MILLION PEOPLE TO THE -- A MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR TO THE UNITED STATES PERMANENTLY. MY ARGUMENT IS, IF YOU'RE IN THE BEST -- IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST PEOPLE AT WHAT YOU DO, I DON'T WANT YOU TEMPORARILY HERE, I WANT YOU HERE PERMANENTLY. I WANT TO YOU BECOME AN AMERICAN. I WANT YOU TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY AND BECOME INGRAINED IN OUR SOCIETY AND A CULTURE. WHAT I'VE ARGUED IS THAT THE PERMANENT LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BECOME MORE MERIT-BASED. WE START ADMITTING PEOPLE TO THIS NATION PERMANENTLY, PRIMARILY A ON THE BASIS WHAT HAVE THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE ECONOMICALLY, NOT SIMPLY ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A RELATIVE LESKING HERE THAT SERVES AS -- RELATIVE LIVING HERE THAT SERVES AS THE MAGNET THAT BRINGS YOU IN. THAT'S WHY I'VE ARGUED FOR A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM. IT REFLECTS THE 21ST CENTURY MUCH MORE ACCURATELY. QUESTIONER: HI, I'M DANIELLE THOMPSON. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU REGARDING OPEN GOVERNMENT. AND GOVERNMENT AS PLATFORM. OPEN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT CITIZENS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE DATA, LAWS AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING GOVERNMENT. AND GOVERNMENT AS PLATFORM, AN IDEA THAT BELIEVES GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR CITIZENS TO PLUG AND PLAY INTO THEIR GOVERNMENTS IN ORDER TO GOVERN THEMSELVES BETTER. AS PRESIDENT, HOW WOULD YOU PROMOTE INITIATIVES SUCH AS OPEN GOVERNMENT, WHICH, COMING FROM A CONSERVATIVE UPBRINGING, WHO BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GOVERN THEMSELVES LOCALLY, HOW WILL YOU SUPPORT INITIATIVES OF OPEN GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AS PLATFORM? MR. RUBIO: ONE OF THE PLATFORMS OUT THERE IS ABOUT THE ONLINE BUDGETING INITIATIVES OR OTHER IDEAS TO MAKE MORE TRANSPARENT THE WAY GOVERNMENT OPERATES, PARTICULARLY SPENDING MONEY. BY PROVIDING THAT ON AN EASY TO USE PLATFORM WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN AC A SESS THE MYSTERIOUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND UNDERSTAND WHERE IT'S SPENDING MONEY, HOW THE MONEY'S BEING SPENT, WHAT THE SALARIES OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ARE, WHAT THE SPENDING PRIORITIES ARE. SO I WOULD BE OPEN TO LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY SO THAT ON AN A ONGOING BASIS INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE WAY GOVERNMENT OPERATES AND THE WAY GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY AND THE SIZE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS, AGENCIES, ETC. I THINK TECHNOLOGY HAS EASY SOLUTIONS FOR THAT IF WE'RE WILLING TO IMPLEMENT IT. QUESTIONER: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. CRAIG AARON FROM FREE PRESS. VERY INTERESTED, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING IN THIS DIALOGUE, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT COMPANIES, USERS AND INDIVIDUALS. I THINK THERE'S BEEN THIS INCREDIBLE UPSWING IN INTERNET ACTIVISM IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, UNITING PEOPLE ACROSS PARTY LINES, AROUND ISSUES OF PERSONAL CONTROL. THEY DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR ONLINE EXPERIENCE. BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO HANDFUL OF BIG CORPORATIONS EITHER. I'M CURIOUS AS PRESIDENT WHAT YOU WOULD DO TO PROTECT PRIVACY, PEOPLE'S INFORMATION AND LEAVE THEM IN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN ONLINE EXPERIENCE. MR. RUBIO: THAT'S IMPORTANT. PART OF IT IS WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S LARGELY -- YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WAY YOUR INFORMATION IS USED AS OPPOSED TO THE PRESUMPTION BEING THE OTHER WAY. THERE'S THIS DEBATE BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH SAYS, IF WE CAN'T SELL CONSUMER INFORMATION, THEN WE CAN'T OFFER ALL THESE SERVICES. THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS THAT MANY AMERICAN USERS, PEOPLE EVEN AROUND THE WORLD ARE NOT AWARE THAT THEIR INFORMATION, UNLESS THEY OPT OUT, IS BEING USED AND SOLD AS A MARKETABLE GOOD. THAT TENSION IS VERY REAL. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF WE'RE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BOTH, I'D STILL ERR ON THE SIDE OF PRIVENESY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS TO OPT IN TO THE WAY THEIR INFORMATION IS USED. THAT MEETS ENORMOUS RESISTANCE, ESPECIALLY FROM BANKS, WHO FIND THEIR CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS OF THEIR CLINES VERY VALUABLE -- CLIENTS VERY VALUEBLE. BUT GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN THESE TWO, I THINK WE ALWAYS ARE ON THE SIDE OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION PROTECTED, FROM BEING USED IN WAYS THEY'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF. >> ON THAT TOPIC IN PARTICULAR, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THIS, BUT IN BANKRUPTCY THE CREDITORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN THE TERMS OF SERVICE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY SIGNED EVEN IF PEOPLE OPTED OUT WHEN THEY SIGNED ON. MR. RUBIO: MEANING IF YOU HAVE A LOAN OR BANK ACCOUNT AND YOU OPTED OUT OF THE INFORMATION, ONCE SOMEONE BUYING YOUR DEBT, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY -- >> YEAH, ANY OF THESE SERVICES. THE COMPANIES COLLECTED ALL THAT DATA AND IF FOR SOME REASON THAT COMPANY GOES BANKRUPTCY, -- BANKRUPT, THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO THAT PRIVACY. MR. RUBIO: THIS IS A 21ST CENTURY ISSUE THAT WE'LL HAVE TO CONFRONT. QUESTIONER: IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THESE RIG TO -- REGULATORY BATTLES THAT COMPANIES FIGHT HAPPEN TO BE LOCAL IN NATURE. AIRBNB IN SAN FRANCISCO OR UBER IN FLORIDA. HOW DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GET IN THERE WHILE PRESERVING SOME OF THESE LOCAL -- MR. RUBIO: IT DOESN'T ON THE LOCAL ISSUES. YOU'RE RIGHT. A LOT OF THESE ARE BEING FOUGHT AT MULTIPLE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOTHING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN COULD -- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO TELL A CITY, YOU HAVE TO ALLOW UBER TO OPERATE. WHERE WE HAVE A ROLE IS IN THE TAX TREATMENT AND EMPLOYMENT ISSUES THAT I POINTED OUT ABOUT HOW DO YOU TREAT AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR -- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S A FEDERAL SOLUTION TO ALL OF THIS, BUT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES ARE CONDUCIVE TO INOVATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IN ADDITION TO CREATH CATEGORIES THAT ALLOW US TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEW EMPLOYMENT, MOST AMERICAN BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY SMALLER ONES, TODAY YOU PAY YOUR TAX RATE ON, THAT ON YOUR PERSONAL RATE, NOT ON THE CORPORATE RATE, SO THAT'S WHERE YOU FIND A LARGE ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY MIGHT BE PAYING VERY FEW TAXES. COMPARED TO A MUCH SMALLER COMPANY. I'VE ARGUED THAT ALL A BUSINESS INCOME, NO MATTER HOW YOU'RE STRUCTURED, ALL BUSINESS INCOME SHOULD BE TAXED AT ONE FLAT RATE OF 25% FOR EVERYONE. THAT INCLUDES THE MONEY YOU'RE MAKING IN A SUBCHAPTER S, YOUR BUSINESS INCOME WOULD ONLY BE TAXED AT 25%. NOT AT 39.5% OR 35% OR WHATEVER YOUR PERSONAL RATE MIGHT BE. THAT'S A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR A SMALLER BUSINESS. I WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO IMMEDIATELY EXPENSE ANYTHING THEY INVEST. AGAIN, A LARGE COOPERATION CAN AFFORD TO TAKE THAT DEDUCTION ON A SCHEDULED DEPRECIATION. A SMALL BUSINESS THAT MAY NOT BE AROUND IN FOUR YEARS THEY CAN'T EXPENSE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS UP FRONT RIGHT AWAY. THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF THINGS WE CAN DO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO CREATE A MORE EVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR NEW OPERATORS AND STARTUPS. QUESTIONER: GREG WALTMAN. I HAVE A QUEEN ENERGY ALTERNATIVE ANALYTICAL COMPANY DO INNOVATIONS IN SOCIAL COMBLEED, PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AS WELL. MR. RUBIO: THAT'S A PRETTY BROAD PORTFOLIO. QUESTIONER: GOING BACK TO ACCESS. I WAS WONDERING, MULTIBILLION DOLLAR WIRE FRAUD, THERE WAS A BIG LOSS IN LONDON. >> LET'S STAY ON TOPIC. QUESTIONER: JOURNALISTS SIT ON THE WIRE ALL DAY FOR A COMPANY LIKE TIME WARNER INC., CONTRIBUTING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THE ECONOMY AND TARGET PEOPLE BLOCKING SALES AND BUSINESS -- >> I'M SORRY. I WOULD LIKE TO YOU RESPECT -- IF YOU DON'T MIND. I WOULD REALLY LIKE -- QUESTIONER: [INAUDIBLE] WIRE FRAUD WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DEAL WITH FRAUD? THE ANSWER IS YOU CAN'T. YOU CHEATED ON YOUR WIFE IN FLORIDA AND -- >> I'M SORRY. QUESTIONER: I THINK YOU SHOULD DROP OUT OF THE RACE. YOUR POLLING NUMBERS ARE TOO LOW TO WIN. >> YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE. I APOLOGIZE. MR. RUBIO: ACTUALLY KINET OF -- KIND OF WEIRD ANYWAY. [LAUGHTER] >> BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING. PLEASE. QUESTIONER: I WAS ENJOYING THIS UNTIL THIS LAST SPEAKER. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE AND HAPPY TO LISTEN TO THIS DISCUSSION. BEING ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF INDEPENDENT TAXI OWNERS IN NEW YORK CITY, I DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO HAVE A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT TO MY BUSINESS. BUT I AM ABLE TO ADAPT. SHOULD UBER OR ANY OTHER COMPANY WHO HAS TAXI TECHNOLOGY, WHO HASN'T BOUGHT TAXI RIGHTS, BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE RIGHTS THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR WITHOUT PAYING? MR. RUBIO: I THINK THEY'RE IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODEL. THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS NOT THE SAME AS A TAXI CAB. IT CONNECTS THE USER ON A DIFFERENT PLATFORM AND A DIFFERENT WAY TO THE SERVICE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACQUIRE. AND THAT'S JUST THE RESULT OF AN ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. IT HAPPENS, IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO SOME PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT IS DISRUPTIVE. BUT EVERY TIME WE'VE HAD ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING IN THIS COUNTRY, IT HAS DISPLACED SOME PEOPLE. AND OUR OBLIGATION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED CAN QUICKLY ACCESS THE BENEFITS OF THE NEW ECONOMY OR THE NEW INNOVATION. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVENTION OF THE CAR WAS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THE HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE INDUSTRY, YET WE HAD TO FIGURE A WAY TO GET THOSE PEOPLE ONLINE, EITHER IN A FACTORY BUILDING CARS OR OTHER INDUSTRY THAT WAS CREATED, THAT ALLOWED THEM TO ONCE AGAIN RESTART THEIR LIVES AND GET GOING AND MOVING FORWARD. BUT WE CAN'T STAND IN THE WAY OF THESE INNOVATIONS. THEY'RE GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY'RE GOING TO HAPPEN IN AMERICA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. OUR JOB IS TO DO THE BEST WE CAN TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE CAUGHT IN THAT DISRUPTION, TO EITHER ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS OR ADD TO THEIR EXISTING SKILLS SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF THAT NEW INNOVATIVE ECONOMY. I THINK ANY EFFORT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF INNOVATION, NOT ONLY IS FRUITLESS, IT'S COUSHT PRODUCTIVE. >> GETTING WORKERS RETRAINED BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF EDUCATION. AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BEING BUILT ON THE 21ST CENTURY MODEL RATHER THAN THE -- 20TH CENTURY PRODDLE RATHER THAN THE 21ST -- MODEL RATHER THAN THE 21ST. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH FEDERAL MONEY FOR TEACHER TRAINING OR -- MR. RUBIO: PART OF IT IS, IF YOU'RE A NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT, YOU'RE LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN OR SOMEBODY WHOLES HAS TO WORK FULL TIME AND RAISE A FAMILY, YOU CAN'T DROP EVERYTHING AND SIT IN A CLASSROOM FOR TWO YEARS AND BE RETRAINED IN A GNAW PROFESSION OR ACQUIRE A NEW SKILL. COMPETENT IS HE-BASED PLERNING -- COMPETENCY-BASED LEARNING WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS. NUMBER ONE, IF YOU HAD AN ALTERNATIVE ACCREDITTING MODEL TO THE EXISTING SIX BIG ACCREDITTER TOS THEY WOULD ACCREDIT INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS. IF YOU HAVE 20 YEARS OF WORK EXPERIENCE, THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING. THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN COLLEGE EQUIVALENT CREDIT FOR. AND THEN WHATEVER YOU'RE MISSING YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PACKAGE FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. WHETHER IT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSE WORK, FREE ONLINE COURSES, PAID ONLINE COURSES, ADDITIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN PACKAGE TOGETHER THE EQUIVALENT OF A COLLEGE DEGREE OR THE EQUIVALENT OF A CERTIFICATE AWARD AND USE THAT. >> THAT'S AT THE HIGH LEVEL. MR. RUBIO: NO, THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. YOU CAN USE THAT TO RETRAIN PEOPLE TO BECOME PAR LEGALS OR RECEPTIONISTS, TO TO BECOME A PARALEGAL AT A LAW OFFICE. YOU CAN CREATE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE AND OTHER WORK EXPERIENCE TO BECOME A WELDER OR SOMEONE THAT WORKS IN FACTORY. >> WHAT ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS, WHERE THEY'RE UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERRESOURCED AND THERE AREN'T TEACHERS TO TRAIN SCIENCE AND MATH? MR. RUBIO: THE K-12 EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS A PRIMARY OBLIGATION OF THE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT. WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GETS INVOLVED ON OCCASION IS HELPING KEY SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION THROUGH FUNDING MECHANISMS, THROUGH THE TITLE 1 PROGRAMS, THROUGH HEAD START AND SO FORTH. MY ARGUMENT IS NOT TO CUT THOSE PROGRAMS. MIERING ARGUMENT IS THAT MONEY SHOULD -- MY ARGUMENT IS THAT MONEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE CHILD, NOT THE CHILD HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MONEY. I WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THAT MONEY TO ACCESS INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I TALKED ABOUT OPENING UP PELL GRANT TO DUAL ENROLLMENT. AT THE FRONT END I BELIEVE THAT PRE-K THROUGH 12 EDUCATION SHOULD REMAIN IN THE CONTROL OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. >> WHAT YOU COULD YOU DOZEN DO AS PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THERE'S -- WHAT COULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THERE'S MORE FUNDING FOR SCIENCE AND MATH? MR. RUBIO: I BELIEVE THAT K-12 EDUCATION BELONGS IN THEA AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. BOTH IN ITS RESPONSIBILITY AND ITS FUNDING. IT'S NEVER BEEN A FEDERAL OBLIGATION. YOU DON'T WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DICTATING THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THAT MONEY WILL ALWAYS COME WITH STRINGS. AND I WANT THE -- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL. YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET THE CREATION OF NEW PROGRAMS AND APPROACHES AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THAT'S WHERE K-12EDCATION PRIMARILY BELONGS. QUESTIONER:KY RESPOND? >> WE WANT TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. QUESTIONER: WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS. THERE'S A LIMIT TO REEDUCATING THESE PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE OLDER. USING THE -- DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR THESE PEOPLE AND CREATE A SAFETY NET? MR. RUBIO: YES. I BELIEVE IN A SAFETY NET. I DON'T THINK FREE ENTERPRISE WORKS WITHOUT A SAFETY NEFMENT FREE ENTERPRISE REQUIRES YOU TO TAKE A RISK IN MANY INSTANCES. IF IT FAILS, THE CONSEQUENCES CAN'T BE THAT YOU'RE DESTITUTE. I DON'T THINK THE SAFETY NET SHOULD BE A LIFE STAPLE OR WAY OF LIFE. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD TAKE OUR -- NUMBER TWO, I THINK OUR SAFETY NET IS FAILING IT. DOESN'T CURE POVERTY. THE PURPOSE OF OUR ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM SHOULD BE TO CURE PROPERTY, NOT TO TREAT ITS SYMPTOMS. THAT'S WHAT OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS HAVE BECOME. A BETTER APPROACH IS THE ONE I'VE ARGUED WHICH IS WE SHOULD TAKE OUR FEDERAL POVERTY MONEY AND ALLOW THEM TO BE SPENT AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL SO THEY CAN DESIGN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET THE CAUSES OR THE LEADING CAUSES OF THAT POVERTY IN THAT COMMUNITY. THE ONLY REQUIREMENT THAT I WOULD HAVE, UNLESS SOMEONE IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED AND LEGITIMATELY DISABLED, THE ONLY REQUIREMENT I WOULD HAVE IS THAT ANYONE WHO IS RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE WORKING OR GOING TO SCHOOL AND SO ANY SOLUTION TO POVERTY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING IT. HAS TO INVOLVE -- NOT JUST PAYING THEIR BILLS IN THE SHORT TERM, IT ALSO HAS TO INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF THE SKILLS KNEW TOAD BECOME EMPLOYABLE AND FIND A JOB -- SKILLS YOU NEED TO BECOME EMPLOYED AND FIND A JOB THAT PAYS MORE. I'VE ALSO ARGUED FOR A WAGE ENHANCEMENT CREDIT. WHICH WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL THAT ONLY MAKES $8 AN HOUR TO RECEIVE AN EXTRA $4 AN HOUR BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY'RE WORKING. THEY'RE NOT HOME UNEMPLOYED. NOW THAT BECOMES A STIGMA ON YOUR RESUME WHEN YOU GET HIRED YEARS LATER. THE LONGER YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED THE HARDER IT IS TO GET RE-EMPLOYED AGAIN. WE'VE OFFERED A NUM NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH. THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S A OBLIGATION ULTIMATELY IS TO CREATE SYSTEMS WHERE INDIVIDUALS WILL FALL ON HARD TIMES, CAN GET BACK UP AND TRY AGAIN. WE DON'T WANT -- WHAT CAN CANNOT BECOME IS WHAT IT IS NOW WHICH IS IN SOME CASES A LIFESTYLE AND IN OTHER CASES A SYSTEM THAT TRAPS YOU. IT MAKES YOU COMFORTABLE IN YOUR POSTBUT IT DOES NOTHING TO CURE IT. WE NEED TO CURE POVERTY. WE'RE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW. QUESTIONER: THANK YOU FOR YOUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION. I AM A TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION ENTREPRENEUR AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT SOMETIMES STARTUPS HAVE TROUBLE FINDING THE RIGHT TALENT TO FILL POSITIONS. OUR LOCAL UNIVERSITIES DO A PRETTY DECENT JOB TRAINING A LOT OF FOREIGN-IMPORTANT STUDENTS. SOME OF WHOM ARE UNDOCUMENTED, LIKE I HAVE BEEN SINCE THE FIRST GRADE. SO AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO HELP FOREIGN-BORN STUDENTS AND DREAMERS LIKE ME WHO WANT TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY, WHO WANT TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY? MR. RUBIO: I BELIEVE WE NEED TO PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT IN ONE MASSIVE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE REASON WHY I KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE I TRIED. WE DON'T HAVE THE VOTES. WE DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL SUPPORT. IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN HARDER TO DO IT THAT WAY. I THINK THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IS TO SAY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE 11 MILLION OR 12 MILLION PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY, WE HAVE TO STOP THE PROBLEM FROM CONTINUING TO GROW FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. SO STEP ONE HAS TO BE TO PROVE THAT WE'VE BROUGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MOVING FORWARD UNDER CONTROL. STEP TWO IS WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE OUR LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S MORE MERIT-BASED AND REFLECTS 291ST CENTURY. . I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE REASONABLE INCLUDING THE MAJORITY WOULD BE REASONABLE HOW YOU DEAL WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS BROUGHT HERE AS A CHILD WHO ISN'T A CRIMINAL, IF THEY'RE A CRIMINAL, THEY CANNOT STAY, BUT THEY ARE NOT A CRIMINAL, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH SOMEONE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. AND DEPENDING ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU HAVE TO COME FORWARD AND PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK AND BECOME PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH, START PAYING TAXES AND YOU GET A WORK PERMIT. A LEGAL STATUS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS. AFTER THAT PERIOD HAS EXPIRED I'M OPEN TO HAVING PEOPLE APPLY FOR A PERMANENT RESIDENCY. THAT WOULD HAVE MAJORITY SUPPORT IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THAT IS THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT. WE HAVE 12 MILL YOP HERE, IF WE DO IT THE WRONG WAY, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER 12 MILLION. AUDIENCE MEMBER: YES. TO BRING BACK YOUR REFRIGERATOR EXAMPLE, WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THE RIGHT TO REPAIR? JOHN DEERE PROHIBITS ONLY AUTHORIZED DEALERS TO REPAIR THINGS. SAME THING FOR APPLE. >> YOU LOSE YOUR WARRANTY. AUDIENCE MEMBER: THERE ARE RESTRICTIVE TERMS OF SERVICE, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU BROUGHT THE WRONG BRAND OF REFRIGERATOR. MANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE BUILDING SMALL REPAIR BUSINESSES, BUT IN TERMS OF SERVICES AND POLICIES OF THE MANUFACTURERS DON'T ALLOW THIRD PARTIES TO REPAIR. SENATOR RUBIO: I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IN DEPTH SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU A GREAT ANSWER. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT INNOVATION AND THESE SORTS OF SERVICES, THESE ARE THE ISSUES WE WILL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. ANY ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION, WHETHER TO THE WORK FORCE OR ISSUES LIKE YOU HAVE RAISED AND WE'LL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THESE. YOU CANNOT STAND IN THE WAY OF IT AND SAY HE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THE THINGS WERE. THAT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ONE. DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE SEAMLESS. I'M SURE WE CAN WORK THROUGH MANY OF THESE, BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DO SO. THIS IS THE U.S. ECONOMY AND ONLY GOING TO CHANGE FASTER THAN EVER AND WE NEED TO ADJUST TO IT QUICKLY. HOST: JUST DISCOVERED A NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT TERMS OF SERVICE. SENATOR RUBIO: ABSOLUTELY. SO IS YOUR REFRIGERATOR WORKING NOW? SENATOR RUBIO: I BOUGHT A NEW ONE. HOST: I HAVE A SITUATION, HE SAID KEEP THE OLD ONE AND WE'LL SEND YOU A NEW ONE, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. SENATOR RUBIO: THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE REFRIGERATOR I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT. HOST: THANK OUR SENATOR FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. [APPLAUSE] . [CAPTIONS",2015-11-07 18:01:37,2015-10-02,Davie,Florida

THIS IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: GOOD AFTERNOON. STUDENTS, FACULTY AND STUDENTS. PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE. AND I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, MRS. HILLARY CLINTON! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN FLORIDA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I NEVER TOOK MUCH INTEREST WHO WAS RUNNING IN PRESIDENT. MY FAMILIES SUPPORTED DEMOCRATS AND WHOEVER ALIGNED THEMSELVES WAS GOING TO ALIGN THEMS. IT WASN'T UNTIL MY 12TH GRADE I MET MY GOVERNMENT TEACHER WHO COUNSELED STUPID TO NOT ONLY LOOK WHAT A DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN MEEPS BUT RESEARCH THE CANDIDATE WHO ARE GOING TO BE INFLUENCING THE POLICIES AND ULTIMATELY DECIDES WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE FUTURE. WITH THAT, I CAN PROUDLY STAND HERE AND SAY, THAT I CHOOSE HILLARY! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> WE MADE HISTORY AND HOLD OFFICE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] . >> I WAS TOO YOUNG IN 2008 AND 2012 TO HELP ELECT BRALKBRALK AS PRESIDENT. AND NOW I HAVE MY CHAPS TO MAKE HISTORY BY VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON WITH OUR HELP WILL BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO PRESENT TO YOU MY CHOICE TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S NOMINEE AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, HILLARY CLINTON! SECRETARY CLINTON: DIDN'T HE DO A GREAT JOB? I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I AM SO PLEASED TO BE HERE AT BROWARD COLLEGE, THIS GREAT CAMPUS, 30,000 STUDENTS HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] . SECRETARY CLINTON: AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING ME. I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HIS CHOICE AND I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TO HELP US GET ORGANIZED IN FLORIDA SO WE WIN THE PRIMARY AND THAT WE WIN THE ELECTION. I THINK CONGRESSMAN DEUTCH IS HERE AND I THANK ALL THE OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS AND EXCITED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN AND BRING UP THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE AND TO ALL OF YOU. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT DARNELL IS DOING, AND THAT IS REGISTERING TO VOTE, BEING ACTIVE IN THE CAMPAIGN, WORKING TO ELECT YOUR CANDIDATE, HOPEFULLY, ME -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SLIPTSLINT AND WHY THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT. I WANT TO SAY THAT MY CAMPAIGN IS FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THE ECONOMY WORKS TO RAISE INCOMES AND PROVIDE JOBS TO EVERYBODY WILLING TO WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND I SAY THIS, BECAUSE I KNOW THE FACTS BACK ME UP, THE ECONOMY WORKS BETTER FOR AMERICA AND AMERICANS WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE! WHAUPWHAUP SECRETARY CLINTON: YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THE STATISTICS, THEY GO BACK A LONG WAY. UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER. INCOMES ARE HIGHER. EVEN THE STOCK MARKET IS HIGHER. AND, IN FACT, WHEN A REPUBLICAN IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU ARE FOUR MORE TIMES LIKELY TO HAVE A RECESSION. NOW, I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO ALL THE BEGINNING OF OUR COUNTRY TO PROVE THIS. THE PAST 35 YEARS. THREE REPUBLICANS AND TWO DEMOCRATS, I'M PRIVILEGED TO HAVE KNOWN BOTH OF THOSE DEMOCRATS -- [APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: EACH OF THEM GOT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. IN MY HUSBAND'S PLACE, IT WAS FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO RONALD REAGAN, CIVIL WAR, LOTS OF OTHER STUFF GOING ON AND TWO TEMPERATURES OF RONALD REAGAN AND ONE TERM OF GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND THE DEFICIT HAD GONE WAY UP AND LOOKED LIKE THERE WERE PROBLEMS. RESESSIONARY PROBLEM. MY HUSBAND SAID IT'S SO MUCH WORSE AND SOMEBODY ASKED HIM, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU UNIQUE BRING TO WASHINGTON? AND HE SAID, MATH. [LAUGHTER] SECRETARY CLINTON: WE ARE GOING TO WORK FOR AMERICANS AND AT THE END OF EIGHT YEARS, 23 MILLION NEW JOBS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST PEOPLE AT THE TOP, PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, WORKING PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE, AND WE ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. ALONG CAME ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. AND THEY WEPT BACK TO THE FAILED POLICY OF TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMY. THE DEBT WAS BACK UP AND WE WERE FACING THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THEY TOOK THEIR OFF OFF THE MARKETS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. SHORTLY AFTER THE 2008 ELECTION, I GOT A CALL FROM PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA AND HE ASKED ME TO SEE HIM IN CHICAGO. I DIDN'T KNOW WHY. HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. WHEN I GOT THERE. HE SAID IT'S SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. I HEARD THAT BEFORE. AND INDEED, IT WAS. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. ALL THOSE JOBS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE PRESIDENT SAID WE HAVE BIG JOBS PROBLEMS AT HOME. HE SAID YOU DEAL WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE ISSUES AND I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID. THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO HAVE A CASE OF COLLECTIVE AMNESIA AND FORGET IT WAS THEIR FAILED POLICIES THAT PUT US IN THAT BIG DITCH. SO NOW, NOW WE HAVE DUG OUR WAY OUT, WE RECOVERED 13 MILLION JOBS. WE HAVE HAD GOOD GROWTH RATES THE LAST QUARTER. SO WE'RE STANDING BUT NOT YET RUNNING AGAIN. NOW, I'M NOT RUNNING FOR MY HUSBAND'S THIRD TERM, I'M RUNNING FOR MY FIRST TERM BUT I'M GOING TO WORK FOR WHAT WORKS FOR THE ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE GOT TO GET WAGES GOING UP AGAIN. PEOPLE HAVE TO FEEL THAT THEIR HARD WORK IS PRODUCING SOMETHING FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WE HAVE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. NOBODY WHO WORKS FULL-TIME ON A MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE MEYERED IN A MINIMUM WAGE. WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WORK HARD AND THEIR WORK PRODUCE PROFITS, THOSE PROFITS ARE NOT JUST SHARED WITH THE C.E.O.'S BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WORKED TO PRODUCE THEM. I HAVE A WHOLE ECONOMIC PLAN THAT IS FOCUSED ON RAISING INCOMES AND I WANT TO SEE US CREATE SOME REALLY GOOD JOBS FOR PEOPLE AGAIN. ONE OF THE WAYS WE ARE GO TO GO DO IT IS COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY TRANGSING TO CLEAN JOBS AND BUSINESSES AND YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS, IT OUGHT TO BE THE PEOPLE IN FL. YOU ALL ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF ALL THESE WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE PESSIMISTIC BUT BE DETERMINED ABOUT IT. SOME STATES ARE MOVING TOWARDS CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN IOWA, AS YOU MIGHT GUESS, AND THEY ARE GETTING 30% OF THEIR ELECTRICITY FROM WIND. I CAME FROM MASSACHUSETTS, WHICH IS NOT KNOWN AS A SUNNY STATE AND THEY RANK NUMBER FOUR IN THE COUNTRY AS SOLAR POWER. I'M HOPING FLORIDA GETS ON TRACK WHEN IT COMES TO WIND, SOLAR AND ADVANCED FUELS AND SOME PEOPLE SAY, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST, MY RESPONSE IS TALK TO A SCIENTIST AND HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY, BECAUSE THIS IS AN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, IT SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS A DRAG BUT A WAY TO LIFT OUR SIGHTS AND DO WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND ACTUALLY CREATE JOBS, MAKE BUSINESSES AND MAKE MONEY DOING IT. I HAVE SET TWO BIG GOALS. I WANT TO INSTALL HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS AND BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM, ENOUGH SOLAR POWER. I'M EXCITED BY THIS CHALLENGE AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN THINK IN YOUR HOME AND BUSINESS WORKING IN YOUR CITY AND STATE. SOMETHING ELSE WE ARE GOING TO DO TO CREATE JOBS. I WANT AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK, A WAY TO FUND WHAT WE OUT TO DO TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN ROADS. WE HAVE BRIDGES THAT ARE FALLING APART. WE HAVE SEWER LINES, WATER LINES, GAT PIPELINES, WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S GOOD WORK AND WE ARE IGNORING IT. SOME OF YOU ARE ORIGINALLY FROM NEW YORK. COMMAUPCHAUP SECRETARY CLINTON: A STATE I WAS PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND A LOT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS 70 TO 150 YEARS OLD. SOME OF THE PIPES AND/OR THINGS GOING UNDER THE GROUND, THEY ARE OLD AND SOME OF THEM ARE EXPLODING. YOU MIGHT READ THAT FROM TIME TO TIME. YOU OUGHT TO GET AHEAD OF IT. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GROWING OUR ECONOMY AND INCREASING INCOME, THEN WE FINALLY ONCE AND FOR ALL, HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: YOU KNOW. THAT'S RIGHT. LET'S BREAK THE GLASS CEILING AND BREAK IT IN EVERY WORKPLACE IN AMERICA. NOBODY AT WORK SHOULD BE DISADVANTAGED. AND I GET LETTERS ALL THE TIME FROM WOMEN WHO ARE REALLY FRUSTRATED AND MAYBE THEY ARE THE SOLE SUPPORTER AND THEY ASKED ME WHAT TO DO AND HOW THEY CAN BE TREATED FAIRLY AND EQUALLY. I WANT TO MAKE THIS POINT. THIS IS A WOMEN'S ISSUE. BUT IT'S A FAMILY ISSUE AND AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. WE WILL GROW OUR ECONOMY MORE IF WE ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANY WAY. REPUBLICANS ARE ALWAYS SAYING WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT THIS, THERE SHE GOES, PLAYING THE GENDER CARD. IF ADVOCATING FOR EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK IS PLAYING THE CARD, THAT IS A HAND THAT I WILL PLAY! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF WHAT I WANT TO DO AS PRESIDENT, EDUCATION, FOR EXAMPLE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO WHAT WE MUST DO TO IMPROVE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION AND LISTENING TO AND RESPECTING TEACHERS WHO ARE IN THE CLASSROOM! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: THEY ARE THE ONES THERE WITH THE KIDS ALL DAY AND THEY HAVE THE IDEAS. THEY SHOULD BE FIRST IN LINE AND WILL BE IN ANY TABLE I'M AT. BUT WE WILL NOT BE AS COMPETITIVELY KEAGS NEAL AS WE WANT TO BE IF WE DON'T HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THOSE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THOSE LITTLE KIDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. I HAVE AN AMAZING, WONDERFUL GRANDCHILD AND WE READ AND TALK AND SING TO HER. HER FIRST WORDS, WE LOVE TO DO IT AND WE DO IT BECAUSE IT BUILDS BRAIN CELLS. 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. I WANT EVERY KID TO HAVE THE SAME SHOT, THE SAME CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. WE NEED A UNIVERSAL PRE- KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AND THE KIDS HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES AND BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME SO EVERY KID HAS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD TO CLIMB THAT LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY. I THINK THAT EVERY PERSON SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER RIGHT GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. SO I'M GOING TO DO ALL I CAN TO MAKE SURE OUR SMALLEST, YOUR YOUNGEST CITIZENS HAVE A CHANCE. ON THE OTHER END, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE GOING TO GIVE ALL OF YOU THE CHANCE TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT DEBT AND BRING DOWN THE COSTS YOU ARE PAYING. IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE OR CAR PAYMENT, WHY CAN'T YOU REFINEANCE YOUR STUDENT DEBT AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE A PROFIT OF LENDING YOU MONEY TO PURSUE YOUR EDUCATION. AND I'M A BIG FAN OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO IMPLEMENT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FREE SO YOU CAN AFFORD TO GO. WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE, I'M GOING TO DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I'M GOING TO DEFEND IT. IT'S WORKING. 18 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GETTING HEALTH CARE AND YOUNG PEOPLE GET TO STAY ON THEIR YOUNG FAMILIES' HEALTH CARE PLAN. OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE TOO HIGH. AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WENT UP 12%. I HAVE PUT FORTH A PLAN TO BRING THEM DOWN. A LOT OF DRUG MANUFACTURERS AREN'T HAPPY WITH ME, BUT IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING THAT WHEN I ROLLED MY PLAN OUT, IT WAS THE SAME DAY THAT A HEDGE FUDGE MANAGER DECIDED TO RAISE THE PRICE OF A LIFE-SAVING DRUG TOP $750 A PILL. A $5,000% INCREASE. WE CAN'T SUSTAIN THAT. WE HAVE TO GET A HAPPENED WILL ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH DRUG COMPANIES TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN. JUST THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE. YOU KNOW, TAXPAYERS, YOU AND I, WE PAY FOR THE N.I.H. AND THE CLINICAL TRIALS. WE PAY FOR THE F.D.A. WHETHER A DRUG IS EFFECTIVE AND WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES FOR THOSE DRUGS. IF YOU ARE IN CARNEDA, YOU GET A NEGOTIATED PRICE, BUT NOT IN AMERICA. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN FROM NORTHERN NEW YORK. WHEN I WAS YOUR SENATOR AND I WOULD SEE BUSLOADS OF PEOPLE TO BUY THE VERY SAME DRUGS FOR A LOWER COST. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE FOR THE DRUGS. WE HAVE GOT TO BRING IN THIS IN. I HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, IT IS DISTRESSING TO ME THAT FLORIDA, AMONGST SOME OTHER STATES, REFUSE TO EXPAND MEDICAID TO COVER MORE PEOPLE. IN FACT, I'M LOOKING HERE. IN FLORIDA, AS MANY AS 650,000 PEOPLE COULD HAVE GOTTEN COVERAGE UNDER MEDICAID. FEWER PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE MEANS FEWER PEOPLE WHO GET PREVENTIVE CARE. MORE VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. IT MAKES NO SENSE ECONOMICALLY. AND I HOPE THAT FLORIDA WOULD RECONSIDER THAT, BUT YOUR GOVERNOR AND THE REPUBLICANS IN TALLAHASSEE -- BOO. SLINTSLIPT THEY SAID NO TO FAMILIES AND NO TO FAIRNESS. AND BECAUSE THEY SAID NO AND REFUSE TO EXPAND MEDICAID, PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. PARTICULARLY WORKING POOR PEOPLE, PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LEFT OUT. IT MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE. IT MAKES NONE. THE STATES WHO HAVE EXPANDED IT, HAVE SEEN LOWER NURNS RATE INCREASES AND NOT SEEING EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND OTHER EXPENSES, PROBLEMS. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE REPUBLICANS KILL IT. THEY VOTED TO REPEAL IT 54 TIMES. I WILL CERTAINLY STAND IN THEIR WAY, BUT I WANT TO IMPROVE IT. I'M GOING TO TASK A LOT OF COSTS AND THREE OTHER ISSUES I WANT TO MENTION. ONE, WE ARE HAVING A CAREGIVING CRISIS, ALEDS I'MER'S. FAMILIES ARE TAKING CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. I BET SOME OF YOU ARE. WE GIVE SO LITTLE HEP. WE NEED RESPITE CARE AND DAY CARE. LET'S HELP THE CAREGIVERS GET THE CARE THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: WE HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN AMERICA. HEROIN, METH, OTHER PRESCRIPTION DUGS AND PEOPLE ARE DYING. WE LOSE 18 TO 22 VETERANS A DAY FROM SUICIDE. A LOT OF THEM CAME BACK AND DIDN'T GET THE CARE THEY NEEDED BUT GOT HANDED A BUNCH OF PILLS AND THEY GOT HOOKED. OUR JOB HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE TREATMENT AND MORE SUPPORT SO PEOPLE CAN GET INTO RECOVERY. 23,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED, ONE IN 10 CAN GET COVERAGE. UNTREETED MENTAL HEALTH IS AN EXPENSIVE PROBLEM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE END UP IN PRISON AND THEY SELF-MED INDICATE. THESE ARE EXPENSIVE AND HEARTBREAKING PROBLEMS. I'M CONVINCED WE CAN TACKLE THEM TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO OUR CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO PULL THEM BACK. SO I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND I WILL FIGHT AGAINST DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD! AND I WILL DEFEND AND FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND AGAINST DISCRIMATION! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: AND I WILL FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY AND AGAINST STATES THAT ARE TRYING TO RESTRICT THEM! AND I WILL FIGHT TO FIGHT CITIZENS UNITED WHICH HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO DARK UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY. I WILL FIGHT TO FIGHT FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY. I WILL MOVE AWAY FROM MASS INCARCERATION BECAUSE BLACK LIVES MATTER! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: I WILL TELL YOU, I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR NEW, EFFECTIVE GUN CONTROL MEASURES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT IS JUST HEARTBREAKING, IT IS SICKENING TO ME TO SEE ANOTHER MASSACRE. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO GO TO COLLEGE LIKE THIS ONE OR GO TO THE MOVIE THEATER OR GO TO BIBLE STUDY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH US THAT WE CAN'T STAND UP TO THE N.R.A. AND THE GUN LOBBY AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SECRETARY CLINTON: THIS IS NOT JUST TRAGIC. WE JUST DON'T NEED TO PRAY FOR PEOPLE BUT TO ACT AND NEED TO BUILD A MOVEMENT. IT'S INFURIATINGS, ANOTHER TIME THERE IS A MASSACRE, REPUBLICANS IN THE N.R.A. SAYS NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK TO GUNS. YES IT IS. IT IS TIME TO ACT. BUT REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY PUT THE N.R.A. AHEAD OF AMERICAN FAMILIES. IT IS WRONG AND WE NEED TO MAKE EVERY POLITICIAN WHO SIDES WITH THEM TO LOOK INTO THE EYES OF PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND EXPLAIN WHY THEY LISTEN TO THE GUN LOBBYISTS INSTEAD. I'M WELL AWARE THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB. BUT YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU DON'T START BY CALLING IT OUT. AND WE HAVE HAD TOO MANY MURDERS, TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER GOTTEN GUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE, TAKING OUT WHATEVER THEIR RAGE, THEIR FURY, THEIR MENTAL PROBLEMSR BY KILLING OTHER PEOPLE. AND I WILL, AS YOUR PRESIDENT, NEVER RELENT ON TRYING TO WORK ON THIS. BUT WE NEED A NATIONAL MOVEMENT. HERE'S WHAT THE OTHER SIDE COUNTS ON. I DON'T THINK THEY REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS OR MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS, BUT THEY COUNT ON REALLY HAVING AN INTENSE, DEDICATED GROUP THAT SCARE POLITICIANS AND SAY, WE WILL VOTE AGAINST YOU. AND PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE HEARTSICK, HEARTBROKEN, DISGUSTED. WE CARE ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST. BUT EACH OF US HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL GUN RESTRICTION. HE PASSED THE BRADY BILL AND ELIMINATED ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR 10 YEARS. SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM ON. WE TOOK THEM IN THE 1990'S AND TAKE THEM ON AGAIN. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THAT'S WHY WE ARE GETTING STARTED HERE IN FLORIDA, HERE AT BROWARD COLLEGE, AND I WANT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE TO HAVE AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE AND REACH AS MANY PEOPLE WE CAN TO MAKE THE CHANGE WE WANT TO SEE. TO BUILD ON WHAT HAS WORKED AND TAKE IT FURTHER. AND NOT LET THE REPUBLICANS RIP THE PROGRESS WITH THEIR OUT OF DATE, OUT OF TOUCH JDS OF IDEAS AND TURN US BACK. NOW, I AM AWARE WE HAVE CHALLENGES AROUND THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY I THINK, MY SPREPS AS SECRETARY OF STATE, AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK IS ESPECIALLY PERTINENT TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE REMAIN SAFE AND SECURE. WE LEAD WITH OUR VALUES AND IN PURSUIT OF OUR INTERESTS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU FOR ME WHAT GETS ME UP AND KEEPS ME GOING IS THE THOUGHT OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND NOT WHAT KIND OF LIFE SHE HAS BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE SURE LIFE AS POSITIVE AS IT CAN BE. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WILL SHE BECOME AN ADULT IN. WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL BE WAITING FOR HER? I'M THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER. MY GRAD GRANDFATHER WORKED HARD AND HE DID IT TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY AND WANTED HIS SONS TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE. THEY ALL WENT TO COLLEGE. HE WORKED HARD AND GAVE US A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFESTYLE AND I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR ME FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN AMERICA. WHATEVER YOUR DREAM MIGHT BE. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT OR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HER POTENTIAL, IT SHOULD APPLY TO FACTORY WORK TRIES AND IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY WORKING TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD AND EVERY YOUNG PERSON HAS THAT ARE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. IF YOU HELP ME, THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH! [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE",2015-11-07 18:01:55,2015-10-02,Davie,Florida
http://www.c-span.org/video/?328620-2/presidential-candidate-bernie-sanders-congressional-hispanic-caucus-institute,Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders at Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute,Bernie Sanders,"HAVE A TOTAL DISTRUST FOR CONGRESS RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE DIDN'T EARN IT, BECAUSE MOST LIKELY WE DID, BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. >> BACK NOW LIVE TO THE CONVENTION CENTER IN WASHINGTON, DC, THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS INSTITUTE, ABOUT TO HEAR FROM SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. >> TO THE NEXT PART OF THIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FORUM. I GOT THE DISTINCT PLEASURE OF HAVING AN AUDIENCE WITH THE VERY IMPRESSIVE SENATOR AT THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS. I KNOW LIKE ME YOU'RE GOING TO FIND SENATOR SANDERS INSPIRING AND READY TO GO ON SO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT. AND WITH THAT, LET ME READ YOU A LITTLE ABOUT THE SENATOR. HE'S SERVE HIS SECOND TERM IN THE U.S. SENATE AFTER WINNING REELECTION IN 2012 WITH 71% OF THE VOTE. HIS PREVIOUS 16 YEARS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MAKE HIM THE LONGEST SERVING INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF CONGRESS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. SENATOR SANDERS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST PERSISTENT VOICES REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND STANDING UP TO CORPORATE STRUCTURES. THROUGHOUT HIS POLITICAL CAREER AS FOUR-TERM MAYOR OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT AND VERMONT'S CONGRESSMAN FOR 16 YEARS AND SENATOR FOR EIGHT YEARS, BERNIE HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE AND ARTICULATE FIGHTER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE. HE'S WORKED TIRELESSLY IN HIS TENURE IN CONGRESS ON ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT GOVERNMENT OFTEN IGNORES: WORKING FAMILIES, THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE ELDERLY, THE CHILDREN, THE POOR, AND I'M GOING TO ADD, AND TOO MANY MINORITY FAMILIES. SENATOR SANDERS, OR BERNIE AS HE IS KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF VERMONT, PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED PRIMARY CARE HEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY THROUGH A MAJOR EXPANSION OF HEALTH CENTERS AND AN EXPANSION OF WHAT WE KNOW AS COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE. WITHOUT THAT EXPANSION, MY STATE, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD HAVE INADEQUATE ACCESS FOR MINORITY POPULATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AND FRONTIER COMMUNITIES. SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT VISION IN THE DEBATE FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YOU ARE INVITED TO JOIN HIM RIGHT HERE UP FRONT AT THE STAGE FOR A MEET AND GREET AFTER HIS REMARKS. NOW, PLEASE WELCOME THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THANK YOU. WELL, LET ME THANK CONGRESSWOMAN GRISHAM FOR THAT WARM INTRODUCTION. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK CONGRESS WOMEN LINDA SANCHEZ AND ESTHERING ING AAGUILLERA AND THANK ALL OF YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THE REASON I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS THAT THIS COUNTRY FACES SOME ENORMOUSLY SERIOUS PROBLEMS. ONE COULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU INCLUDE THE CRISIS REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE, THERE ARE MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS TODAY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND I KNOW THAT MUCH OF THE MEDIA THINGS OF POLITICS AS HOW MUCH HONEMONEY YOU RAISE, YOUR STANDING IN THE POLLS, WHAT KIND OF DUMB THING YOU SAID LAST NIGHT. BUT ALL OF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT POLITICS IS IN FACT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY, WHAT HAPPENS TO TENS AND TENS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM ARE HURTING TODAY. AND WHAT I HOPE ALL OF YOU UNDERSTAND, AND I KNOW YOU DO, OR YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE TONIGHT, YOU WOULD NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS, IS THAT IF WE DO NOT BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, IF WE DO NOT ENGAGE PEOPLE IN SERIOUS DISCUSSION, IF WE DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE VOTER TURNOUT, NOT GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. SO WHAT I ASK OF ALL OF YOU IS TO ENGAGE IN THAT DEBATE. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUTS IN THE WORLD, NOT ONE OF THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUTS, AND THAT WE IN FACT START ADDRESSING SOME OF THE REAL PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY. WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS TOUCH ON A FEW OF THOSE ISSUES. AND THE FIRST ONE I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE NEED FOR REAL IMMIGRATION REFORM. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STAIN OF RACISM WHICH HAS EXISTED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE WORLD FOR GOD KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC REALITY WHICH FACES OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT IS, WE HAVE A MIDDLE CLASS WHICH FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS HAS BEEN DISAPPEARING, AND WE HAVE MASSIVE LEVELS OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAT WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS. NOW, AS EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS, THROUGHOUT HISTORY, AND FOR WHATEVER REASON, AND I'M NOT A PSYCHIATRIST, WE HAVE LIVED WITH A STAIN OF RACISM ON ALL OF HUMAN EXISTENCE. NOW, IN MY OWN CASE, I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RACISM AND WHAT IT MEANS. MY FATHER LOST MUCH OF HIS FAMILY IN EUROPE AS A RESULT OF THE HOLOCAUST. AND HE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF 17 NOT SPEAKING A WORD OF ENGLISH. SO I THINK THE FIRST POINT THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE IS A COMMITMENT TO END INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS FOR A MOMENT. THERE CAN BE DISAGREEMENTS AMONG HONEST PEOPLE ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU IN A MOMENT WHAT MY VIEW IS. BUT WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IS DEMAGOGUERY. WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IS ATTEMPTING TO DEFINE WHAT GROUP OF PEOPLE, QUOTE UNQUOTE, AS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF DEBATE AND DISCUSSION WE NEED IN AMERICA TODAY. THAT IS RACISM. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND THAT HAS GOT TO BE REJECTED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> ONE OF THE GREAT STRENGTHS OF AMERICAN, PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD DON'T REALIZE IT, IS IN FACT, WE ARE A NATION OF MANY, MANY, PEOPLE, OF MANY COLORS, OF MANY BACKGROUNDS, OF MESSENGER LANGUAGES. AND IN MY VIEW, THAT MAKES US A STRONGER NATION, NOT A WEAKER NATION. THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. MY DAD CAME FROM POLAND. MANY OF YOUR PARENTS CAME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. BUT WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER AS A PEOPLE AND WE BRING OUR DIFFERENT CULTURES TOGETHER, WE CREATE A NATION OF EXTRAORDINARY CAPABILITIES WHICH BECOME STRONGER BECAUSE OF OUR DIVERSITY, SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. [ APPLAUSE ] AS HE MENTIONED, MY FATHER CAME FROM POLAND WITHOUT A NICKEL IN HIS POCKET. COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. AND HE NEVER MADE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. I GREW UP IN A THREE AND A HALF ROOM RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK. MY MOTHER'S DREAM WAS THAT SOMEDAY SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO OWN HER OWN HOUSE. SHE DIED YOUNG, NEVER ACHIEVED THAT DREAM. BUT MY DAD WAS THE PROUDEST AMERICAN YOU COULD EVER SEE, BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD THE EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS GREAT COUNTRY GAVE HIM AND HIS FAMILY. AND THE FACT THAT A VERY POOR YOUNG MAN FROM POLAND COULD SEE HIS TWO KIDS GO TO COLLEGE WAS SOMETHING OF ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCE FOR OUR FAMILY. TODAY, AS ALL OF YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 11 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. 99% OF WHOM CAME TO THIS COUNTRY TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES, TO ESCAPE OPPRESSION, TO FLEE DESPERATE POVERTY AND VIOLENCE. AND LET US BE FRANK ABOUT AN ISSUE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ENOUGH, AND THAT IS THAT TODAY'S UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS PLAY AN EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR ECONOMY. WITHOUT THESE WORKERS, IT IS LIKELY THAT MUCH OF OUR AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM WOULD COLLAPSE. A SIMPLE REALITY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> TODAY, UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE DOING THE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WORK OF HARVESTING OUR CROPS, BUILDING OUR HOMES, COOKING OUR MEALS, AND CARRYING FOR OUR CHILDREN. IN FACT, THEY ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] AND LET ME JUST TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH -- ONE OF MY EXPERIENCES WITH UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. BACK IN 2007, I LEARNED ABOUT THE HORRENDOUS EXPLOITATION IN FLORIDA. ANYBODY HERE FROM FLORIDA? YOU GUYS HEARD OF IMOCLE? IT'S NEAR NAPLES. IT TURNS OUT THAT IN IMOCLE, FLORIDA, THAT IS A TOWN WHERE A LOT OF THE TOMATOES ARE GROWN, LOW GRADE TOMATOES THAT ARE USED IN McDONALD'S AND IN BURGER KING. AND THE PEOPLE WHO HARVEST THOSE CROPS ARE BY AND LARGE UNDOCUMENTED. ON THE DAY THAT I ARRIVED, THE DAY THAT I CAME TO IMOCLE, FLORIDA, COINCIDENTALLY ENOUGH, THE U.S. ATTORNEY WAS ANNOUNCING AN INDICTMENT OF SOME CONTRACTORS THERE WHO EMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELDS ON THE GROUNDS OF SLAVERY. THIS IS THE YEAR 2007. PEOPLE WERE BEING HELD IN IN INVOLUNTARILY SERVITUDE. I SAW THE CONDITIONS THE WORKERS WORK UNDER. THEY WORK VERY LOW AND IRREGULAR HOURS FOR VERY LOW WAGES. THEIR HOUSING WAS ABYSMAL. AND THE REALITY OF THEIR LIVES AND WHY THEY WERE ABLE TO BE EXPLOITED WAS THEY COULD NOT STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO LEGAL STATUS. AND THAT'S THE SIMPLE FACT OF IT. NOW, THIS STORY HAS A SOMEWHAT HAPPY ENDING, IN THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HOLD A HEARING ON THIS ISSUE, AND THIS WAS WHEN THE LATE TED KENNEDY WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE, AND HE AND I WORKED TOGETHER. WE HAD A HEARING. WE BROUGHT SOME PEOPLE UP THERE. THE END OF IT ALL IS FOR A LOT OF REASONS, A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE DOING GREAT WORK, WE ENDED UP IMPROVING WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS. BUT TODAY, 11 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY REMAIN UNDOCUMENTED AND ARE HAVING AND STRUGGLING TO ADEQUATELY FEED THEIR FAMILIES. THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY TO ESCAPE GAININGNG VIOLENCE AND DESPERATE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. LET ME ALSO BE CLEAR ON RAISING AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT TALKED ABOUT VERY MUCH, AND THAT5amn IS WHEN PEOPLE COME ACROSS THE BORDER, THEY KNOW FULL WELL THAT THERE ARE EMPLOYERS WHO WILL HIRE THEM. AND IF ANYONE THINKS THAT EMPLOYERS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE WORKERS THAT THEY ARE HIRING AND IN MANY CASES EXPLOITING ARE UNDOCUMENTED, THEN YOU DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF AMERICA FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? I SUPPORTED THE 2013 COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM LEGISLATION IN THE U.S. SENATE. WHILE IT IS A COMPLICATED PIECE OF LEGISLATION, AND IT IS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT CAN AND MUST BE IMPROVED, I BELIEVE THAT IT PROVIDED A RESPONSIBLE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP SO INDIVIDUALS COULD IN FACT COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND PEOPLE CAN WALK THE STREETS WITH SAFETY. PEOPLE CAN HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGH. PEOPLE CAN HAVE THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW AND PARTICIPATE FULLY AND WITHOUT FEAR IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. TO TELL YOU A STORY, I WAS IN PHOENIX PHOENIX A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. A COUPLE OF LATINO KIDS CAME UP, WE CHATTED A WHILE. THERE WERE TEARS COMING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS AS THEY TALKED ABOUT THEIR FEAR OF BEING DEPORTED OR OF HAVING THEIR PARENTS BEING DEPORTED. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF EXISTENCE, THE KIND OF FEAR THAT WE WANT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY, TO EXPERIENCE. AND THAT IS WHY WE MUST PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOW, AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THE SENATE BILL ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IMPORTANT GOAL. AND IN MY VIEW, THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE FOR MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO END THE DEMAGOGUERY AND IN FACT TAKE UP SERIOUS IMMIGRATION REFORM. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THE SENATE BILL CONTAINED THE PROVISIONS OF THE DREAM ACT, WHICH I STRONGLY SUPPORT. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO COMPRISE THE DREAMERS FOR WHAT THEY ARE. THEY ARE AMERICAN KIDS WHO DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE IN THE COUNTRY THEY KNOW AS HOME. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOW, THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT I DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT CRITICISMS OF THIS LONG AND VERY COMPLICATED PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I BELIEVE THE PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP WAS UNNECESSARILY LINKED TO BORDER SECURITY TRIGGERS, MEASURES THAT MANY BELIEVE WERE PUT IN PLACE SO THAT THE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP WOULD BE DELAYED OR EVEN DENIED FOR THE MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS HERE. AND I WANT TO CHANGE THOSE PROVISIONS. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE PENALTIES AND FINES IN THE BILL WOULD BE A BAR, AN IMPEDIMENT FOR LOW-INCOME PEOPLE, ESSENTIALLY PREVENTING THEM FROM ACCESSING THE PATH TO LEGAL RESIDENCY AND EVENTUAL CITIZENSHIP. TO BE MEANINGFUL, A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVABLE FOR MILLIONS OF WORKERS AT THE LOWER END OF THE ECONOMIC LADDER. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THESE AND OTHER BARRIERS IN THE BILL, INCLUDING THE TIME IT TAKES, OFTEN MORE THAN A DECADE, MAKES IT A FLAWED PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. IN FAIRNESS, IN A BIPARTISAN WAY, AT LEAST THE SENATE DID SOMETHING. THE TIME IS VERY LONG OVERDUE FOR THE HOUSE TO ACT. [ APPLAUSE ] >> NOW, UNTIL WE CAN PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, AND I HOPE THAT IS SOONER THAN LATER, WE MUST BE AGGRESSIVE IN PURSUING POLICIES THAT ARE HUMANE AND SENSIBLE, AND THAT KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER. THIS INCLUDES TAKING MEASURES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, INCLUDING USING THE PRESIDENTIAL POWER OF EXECUTIVE ORDER WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE. WHILE THE SENATE PASSED THE DREAM ACT IN ITS IMMIGRATION BILL, AND WHILE THE HOUSE HAS NOT ACTED, I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA DID EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING THROUGH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS. D.A.C.A. D.A.C.A. AND DEFERRED ACTION FOR PARENTS OF AMERICANS AND LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS WERE GOOD FIRST STEPS, BUT SHOULD BE IN MY VIEW EXPANDED. DEFERRED ACTION SHOULD INCLUDE THE PARENTS OF DREAMERS. WE SHOULD BE PURSUING POLICIES THAT UNITE FAMILIES, NOT TEAR THEM APART. [ APPLAUSE ] >> OBVIOUSLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE, DEEPLY CONCERNED ISSUING OF RACISM. BUT LIKE EVERY OTHER GROUP IN AMERICA, THE LATINO COMMUNITY, MAYBE MORE THAN MOST, IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM. AND LET ME TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO TOUCH UPON THAT. THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF AMERICA TODAY IS THAT, YES, WE WERE DOING BETTER THAN WE DID SEVEN YEARS AGO, WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH LEFT OFFICE, AND WHEN WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH, WHEN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE, AND WE WERE RUNNING UP THE LARGEST DEFICIT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE ARE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN WE WERE THEN. BUT, AND HERE IS THE BIG ""BUT,"" WHAT WE SHOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE IS THAT FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS, 40 YEARS, THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS OF THIS COUNTRY, ONCE THE ENVY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD, HAS BEEN DISAPPEARING. AND THAT HAS ACCELERATED SINCE THE WALL STREET CRASH OF 2008. AND WHILE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TODAY ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES, AND WHILE YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH, AND WHILE YOUNG PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND WHILE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH, THERE IS ANOTHER ECONOMIC REALITY THAT IS TAKING PLACE WHICH NEEDS A LOT OF DISCUSSION, AND THAT IS THAT THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS ARE DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL, AND ALMOST ALL OF THE NEW INCOME AND WEALTH BEING CREATED ARE GOING TO THE TOP 1%. NOW, THAT'S A FACT. AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE GET UNEASY AND UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT TALKING ABOUT IT. BUT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE PUT ON THE TABLE. BECAUSE WE NEED TO CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US, WORKS FOR SENIORS, WORKS FOR THE CHILDREN, WORKS FOR WORKING FAMILIES, AND NOT JUST AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR THE TOP 1%. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AT A TIME WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS TO BRING IN ENOUGH INCOME AND HEALTHCARE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES, IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT LATINOS MAKE UP MORE THAN 16% OF OUR POPULATION, BUT HAVE ONLY 2.2% OF THE NATION'S WEALTH. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY HAS REACHED TRAGIC PROPORTIONS. AND I WANT TO SAY A WORD ON THAT, BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS TOO RARELY DISCUSSED. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I ASKED SOME ECONOMISTS TO DO A STUDY FOR ME. AND THE STUDY IS, TELL ME WHAT THE REAL RATE OF YOUTH, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA IS. AND THIS IS WHAT THEY REPORTED BACK. IF YOU ARE A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE, NOT A DROPOUT, A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 17 AND 20, IF YOU ARE WHITE, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS 33%. IF YOU ARE HISPANIC, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS 36%. IF YOU ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS 51%. NOW, WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE HAVE MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES, START A CAREER, MAKE SOME MONEY, BECOME INDEPENDENT, BECOME ADULTS, AND YET THEY HAVE NO EDUCATION. AND IF ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THINGS THAT IT IS A COINCIDENCE THAT WHEN WE HAVE 5.5 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL AND ARE NOT WORKING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH, IF YOU THINK THAT'S A COINCIDENCE, YOU WOULD BE SORELY MISTAKEN. IN MY VIEW IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION, INVEST IN JOBS, RATHER THAN IN JAILS AND INCARCERATION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE. AND BY THE WAY, I WANT TO APPLAUD THE PRESIDENT FOR JUST YESTERDAY ANNOUNCING THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR KNOLL VIOLENT CRIME WILL BE RELEASED. AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. [ APPLAUSE ] >> TOGETHER WE MUST END THIS DUBIOUS DISTINCTION OF THE UNITED STATES HAVING MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. AND WE MUST MOVE TO THE DISTINCTION OF HAVING THE BEST EDUCATED POPULATION ON EARTH. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND AS PART OF THAT WHOLE ISSUE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, A HUGE ISSUE, I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ELIMINATE PRIVATELY RUN JAILS AND IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND BY THE WAY, WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE ENDING THE QUOTA FOR DETAINING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> CORPORATIONS SHOULD NOT BE MAKING PROFITS ON THE INCARCERATION OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND WHERE IT IS TODAY, IT IS FIRST OF ALL THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. TODAY IN AMERICA, THE TOP 1/10th OF 1% OWNS ALMOST AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. GOT THAT? TOP 1/10th OF 1% OWNS ALMOST AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. TODAY IN AMERICA, WITH PEOPLE WORKING INCREDIBLY LONG HOURS, PEOPLE WORKING 50, 60 HOURS A WEEK, 58% OF ALL NEW INCOME IS GOING TO DO TOP 1%. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN AMERICA, THE 14 WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SAW THEIR WEALTH INCREASE, WEALTH INCREASE BY $156 BILLION. THAT WEALTH INCREASE IN TWO YEARS IS MORE WEALTH THAN IS OWNED BY THE BOTTOM 130 MILLION AMERICANS. ""WOW"" IS THE RIGHT RESPONSE. BUT IT'S MORE THAN ""WOW."" IT IS IMMORAL. IT IS UNSUSTAINABLE. AND WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A RIGGED ECONOMY WHICH SAYS, HEADS THEY WIN, TAILS YOU LOSE. AND WE NEED AN ECONOMY, AND WE CAN BUILD AN ECONOMY, WHICH WORKS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT TOGETHER WE HAVE GOT TO DO. BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, IT IS NOT JUST THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAT HAS TO CHANGE. IT IS ALSO THE REALITY THAT IF YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS, AND LET ME TELL YOU A STORY HERE, I WAS IN DES MOINES, IOWA A FEW MONTHS AGO, AND I TALKED TO A GUY WHO WORKS FOR A CHURCH GROUP AT A FARMER'S MARKET. WHAT HE WAS DOING IS COLLECTING THE FOOD THAT WAS NOT SOLD AND TAKING IT TO AN EMERGENCY FOOD SHELTER. AND I ASKED HIM, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE FOLKS THAT GO TO THAT EMERGENCY FOOD SHELF ARE WORKING? AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HIS ANSWER WAS? 90%. IN OTHER WORDS, IN DES MOINES AND ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING REALLY, REALLY HARD, BUT THEY'RE NOT EARNING ENOUGH MONEY TO ADEQUATELY FEED THEIR KIDS. AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE A FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF $7.25 AN HOUR. NOW, YOU COULD DO THE ARITHMETIC AS WELL AS I CAN. MULTIPLY 7.25 TIMES 40 HOURS A WEEK, 52 WEEKS A YEAR. AND WHAT YOU WILL FIND IS THAT WAGE IS TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR ANYBODY TO SURVIVE WITH A SHRED OF DIGNITY. IN MY VIEW, WHEN YOU HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS A STARVATION WAGE, WE HAVE GOT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO A LIVING WAGE. THAT IS $15 AN HOUR OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND BY THE WAY, WHILE EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY, ALL LOW INCOME WORKERS WOULD BENEFIT, NEARLY 60% OF LATINO WORKERS WOULD GET A RAISE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY, WE'VE ALSO GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE LIVE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AND IF WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, WE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKFORCE THAT WE CAN. AND IN THAT REGARD, IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME THAT TODAY WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE WELL IN SCHOOL, WHO ARE QUALIFIED TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT CANNOT GO TO COLLEGE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ALONE, AND THAT IS THEIR FAMILIES LACK THE MONEY. THAT IS ABSURD FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS TERRIBLY UNFAIR TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO SAY TO THEM, YOU'RE PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BECOME AN ENGINEER, A DOCTOR, A SCIENTIST, A TEACHER, WHATEVER, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT, BECAUSE YOUR FAMILIAR LACKS THE MONEY TO GET YOU A HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT IT IS ALSO ABSURD FOR OUR COUNTRY WHICH NEEDS TO DEVELOP THE BEST INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL THAT WE CAN. AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AND WOULD FIGHT TO MAKE HAPPEN AS PRESIDENT THAT EVERY PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN THIS COUNTRY BE TUITION-FREE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND THE REASON WHY THAT IS A BIG DEAL IS OBVIOUSLY IT WILL HELP SO MANY WORKING CLASS AND MIDDLE CLASS AND LOWER INCOME FAMILIES, BUT IT DOES SOMETHING ELSE. IT TELLS CHILDREN IN THE FOURTH GRADE OR THE SIXTH GRADE NOT TO GIVE UP, TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR SCHOOLWORK, TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK, BECAUSE WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT ANY CHILD IN AMERICA, REGARDLESS OF HIS OR HER INCOME, WILL IN FACT BE ABLE TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THAT IS A BIG DEAL. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH IS OF ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCE TO THIS COUNTRY AND TOUCHES ON EVERY OTHER ISSUE. AND THAT IS THE FACT THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DISASTROUS CITIZENS UNITED SUPREME COURT DECISION, OUR CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM HAS BECOME CORRUPT, AND I USE THAT WORD ADVISEDLY. AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS BEING UNDERMINED. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME THAT WE HAVE A CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM WHICH TODAY ALLOWS MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES TO CONTRIBUTE AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY WANT INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS IN ORDER TO ELECT CANDIDATES WHOSE JOB IN LIFE WILL BE TO REPRESENT THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL. WHEN YOU HAVE ONE FAMILY, THE KOCH BROTHERS, WORTH SOME $85 BILLION, WHEN THIS ONE EXTREME RIGHT WING FAMILY WILL BE SPENDING SOME $900 MILLION IN THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE, WHICH IS MORE MONEY THAN EITHER THE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL BE SPENDING, WHEN YOU HAVE ONE FAMILY OUTSPENDING EITHER OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES IN THIS COUNTRY, MY FRIENDS, YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT OLIGARCHY. AND THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ELECTION REFORM, I TRUST THAT ALL OF YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE OVERTLY PARTISAN HERE, BUT I HAVE TO BE, THAT IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY, IN REPUBLICAN STATES, ONE STATE AFTER ANOTHER, THERE IS A VERY CONCERTED EFFORT TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE, TO MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR, FOR LOW-INCOME PEOPLE, FOR OLDER PEOPLE, FOR STUDENTS, TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. AND THEY DO THIS UNDER THE GUYS OF TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR STATES FROM VOTER FRAUD. VOTER FRAUD IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. FORTUNATELY, IT HARDLY EXISTS IN AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THE INTENTION IS OF THOSE VOTER SUPPRESSION EFFORTS. WHAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES ARE SAYING IS, WE DON'T WANT A FAIR ELECTION. WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO PREVENT PEOPLE WHOSE VIEWS ARE DIFFERENT THAN OURS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. NOW, I'VE RUN FOR OFFICE MANY, MANY TIMES IN THE STATE OF VERMONT. OFTEN I'VE WON. SOMETIMES I'VE LOST. BUT IT HAS NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO FIGURE OUT OUT WAY TO DENY PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH ME THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SO WHAT WE NEED IS FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT MAKES IT CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT ANY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY WHO IS 18 YEARS OF AGE HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE, DISCUSSION ENDED. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WE HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS. LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TODAY IS THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH, THE ONLY ONE, THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE PAID FAMILY SXHAND MEDICAL LEAVE. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE ARE WOMEN TODAY WHO ARE GIVING BIRTH. IF THOSE MOMS AND THAT FAMILY HAVE SUFFICIENT INCOME, MOM AND MAYBE DAD WILL BE ABLE TO STAY HOME WITH THE BABY, GET TO LOVE THE BABY, KNOW THE BABY, NURTURE THE BABY IN A WAY THAT BABIES DESERVE. BUT IF THAT MOTHER IS LOW INCOME OR WORKING CLASS, THE LOOKED LIKE IS THAT ONE WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AFTER SHE GIVES BIRTH, SHE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK IN ORDER TO EARN INCOME TO TAKE CARE OF HER FAMILY. NOW, YOU HEAR A WHOLE LOT IN THIS COUNTRY ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. SEPARATING A MOTHER FROM A NEWBORN BABY BECAUSE SHE LACKS THE INCOME TO STAY HOME IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE. IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF A FAMILY VALUE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> NOW, IN MY VIEW, WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN THIS COUNTRY AGAINST TREMENDOUS IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITION IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. AND WE DID THAT THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE YOUNG OR UNDER 26 CAN STAY ON YOUR PARENTS' INSURANCE POLICY. IF SOME OF YOU OR YOUR PARENTS HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, WE HAVE ENDED THE OBSCENITY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES SAYING, OH, YOU HAVE CANCER, YOU HAD CANS ARE FIVE YEARS AGO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO INSURE YOU FOR CANCER. WE HAVE ENDED THAT OBSCENITY. AND WE HAVE PROVIDED INSURANCE FOR SOME 15 MILLION AMERICANS WHO PREVIOUSLY LACKED HEALTH INSURANCE. ALL OF THAT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. BUT WHAT WE HAVE NOT DONE, AND I HOPE ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT, IS WE HAVE NOT ENDED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF BEING THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH, THE ONLY ONE, THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE HEALTHCARE TO ALL PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. AND TODAY WE HAVE 29 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE ZERO HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANY MORE WHO ARE UNDERINSURED, WITH HIGH PREMIUMS AND HIGH DEDUCTIBLES. SO COUNT ME IN AS SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE, AND THAT WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARD A MEDICARE FOR ALL SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM. [ APPLAUSE ] >> LET ME CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BY ASKING TWO FAVORS OF YOU. NOT FOR ME, BUT FOR OUR COUNTRY. NUMBER ONE, WHEN FOLKS TELL YOU, WHEN YOUR FRIENDS TELL YOU, WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME GOING TO MEETINGS WHERE THEY ARE DISCUSSING ALL THESE BORING ISSUES LIKE IMMIGRATION OR JOBS OR HEALTHCARE OR CLIMATE CHANGE, WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME WHEN YOU COULD BE OUT PARTYING? YOU TELL THEM THAT WHEN THE SECOND WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY IS SPENDING $900 MILLION ON THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU TELL THEM THAT POLITICS IS IN FACT VERY IMPORTANT. AND WHO IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, WHO CONTROLS THE U.S. HOUSE, WHO CONTROLS THE SENATE, WHO CONTROLS GOVERNORSHIPS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY IS OF ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCE TO THEIR LIVES, THEIR PARENTS' LIVES, AND TO THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES. SO MY FIRST REQUEST OF YOU IS DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN TO ENGAGE PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. [ APPLAUSE ] WE HAD AN ELECTION LAST NOVEMBER. 63% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE. 80% OF YOUNG PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE. SO ORDINARY PEOPLE, BY THE TENS OF MILLIONS, DO NOT VOTE. TRUST ME, THAT VOID IS FILLED BY VERY WEALTHY AND POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS. BIG CAMPAIGN DONORS WHO ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT YOU TO VOTE. THEY WANT YOU TO THINK THAT POLITICS IS A JOKE, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. THEY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN GIVE TAX BREAKS TO MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES, SO THAT WE CAN GIVE TAX BREAKS TO CORPORATIONS SO THEY CAN SHUT DOWN THEIR FACTORIES AND MOVE ABROAD, BUT IF YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE HEALTHCARE TO ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, THAT WE ADDRESS THE PLANETARY CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THAT WE END SEXISM AND RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY, IF YOU THINK THOSE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT, THEN YOU BETTER GET INVOLVED VERY DEEPLY IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS, BECAUSE WE NEED YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> AND THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU THAT YOU LIVE TODAY IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, TODAY. AMERICA IS THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE ALL HAVE GOT TO THINK BIG, NOT SMALL. PLEASE DO NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THESE DEBATES THAT TAKE PLACE HERE ON CAPITOL HILL ABOUT WHETHER WE CUT EDUCATION BY 2% OR RAISE IT BY 1%. THAT'S THINKING SMALL. WHAT I WANT YOU TO ASK YOURSELVES IS WHY IS IT THAT IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH. WHY IS THAT? WHY IS IT IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE EARTH DOESN'T GUARANTEE HEALTHCARE TO PEOPLE AS A RIGHT OR HAS PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE? WHY ARE WE THE ONLY COUNTRY? WHY ARE WE THE COUNTRY ON EARTH, MAJOR COUNTRY, THAT HAS MORE INCOME AND WEALTH DISPARITY THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY? WHY IS IT THAT IN GERMANY AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL AND MEDICAL SCHOOL TUITION-FREE WHILE IN AMERICA HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE WHILE OTHERS BY THE MILLIONS GRADUATE SCHOOL DEEPLY, DEEPLY IN DEBT? WHY IS THAT? AND IN MY VIEW, WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES, IT COMES DOWN TO THE REALITY THAT WE HAVE A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE, PEOPLE I CALL THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS, WHOSE GREED HAS NO END. THEY WANT IT ALL. THEY WANT ALL OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF OUR SOCIETY. THEY WANT TO CONTROL THE POLITICAL LIFE OF OUR SOCIETY. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, THESE PEOPLE ARE ENORMOUSLY, ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL. THEY FUND POLITICIANS OF BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES. THEY CONTROL MUCH OF OUR MEDIA. IN MY VIEW, THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US RATHER THAN JUST THE TOP 1%, IS TO BRING ABOUT WHAT I CALL A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. AND WHAT THAT MEANS, ESSENTIALLY, IS THAT ALL OF US BECOME ENGAGED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS, THAT ALL OF US DEMAND THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CONGRESS START REPRESENTING THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE AND NOT JUST THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] >> SO WITH THAT I WOULD LOVE TO WELCOME MANY OF YOU TO THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION. AND THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR HEARING ME OUT. THANK YOU.

WE WILL TAKE YOU LIVE NOW TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH REMARKS FROM JEB BUSH ON HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES. INTRODUCTIONS ARE UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW. >> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE KEVIN HARRINGTON STUDENT AMBASSADORS THAT HELP TO RUN THE INSTITUTE AND MAKE EVERY EVENT'S SUCCESS. JEB BUSH SERVED AS GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA FROM 1999 TO 2007. AS GOVERNOR, HE ENACTED REFORMS THAT HELPED BUSINESSES SAVE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF MONEY PER YEAR. HE MADE FLORIDA'S ECONOMY WORK FOR ITS RESIDENTS. GOVERNOR BUSH CHAMPIONED REFORM AND HIS -- IN HIS GOVERNMENT. AFTER HE LEFT OFFICE, HE RETURNED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, WHERE HE REESTABLISHED HIS CAREER AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, ENTREPRENEUR, AND INVESTOR. FINALLY, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, JED AND HIS WIFE, COLUMBA, ARE PROUD PARENTS AND VERY PROUD GRANDPARENTS TO FOUR GRANDCHILDREN. PLEASE GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO JEB BUSH. [APPLAUSE] JEB BUSH: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THIS GREAT UNIVERSITY. THIS IS MY THIRD OR FOURTH VISIT. THE PRIMARY SEASON IS YOUNG. I'LL BE BACK, I'M SURE. IT IS A JOY TO BE WITH YOU ALL. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HOW TO RETURN WHAT WE HAVE INTO A 21ST CENTURY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM? NOT JUST INSURANCE, BUT THE SYSTEM ALTOGETHER. HOW CAN WE ENVISION WHAT A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CAN LOOK LIKE IN 2025, RATHER THAN PROTECT THE VERSION OF 1975, WHICH IN EFFECT IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW. AMERICA, REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IS A PLACE OF DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION. IF WE FIX A FEW BIG THINGS, WE CAN TRANSFORM OURSELVES BECAUSE WE ARE THE MOST DYNAMIC COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF POLICY TO MAKE POLICY BETTER FOR OURSELVES, OUR CHILDREN, AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. THIS WILL REQUIRE A NEW APPROACH ON HOW WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAY HEALTHY, HEALTHY REWARD THAT -- HOW WE REWARD THAT. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME PERSONAL ANECDOTES. NEXT WEEK, OR THE WEEK AFTER NEXT, ON THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY IS AN EVENT THAT MY WIFE, COLUMBA, AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH TWO O FIGHT CYSTIC FIBROSIS. TODAY, IF YOU ARE BORN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS, THERE ARE MEDICINES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE LAST 3-4 YEARS, AND MORE ON THE WAY, THAT WILL ULTIMATELY ALLOW SOMEONE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS TO LIVE AS LONG AS EVERYBODY ELSE HERE ARE GRANDCHILDREN, BEING BORN TODAY, IF WE GET THIS RIGHT, WILL LIVE WAY BEYOND 100 YEARS. IT CREATES CHALLENGES, BUT IT IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM OUR SOCIETY FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE LIVES OF PURPOSE AND MEANING. WE CANNOT STICK WITH THE STATUS QUO. WE CANNOT LEAVE THIS UP TO THE LOBBYISTS AND POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY, OBAMACARE, IN ITS CURRENT FORM, WAS WRITTEN BY THE SPECIAL INTERESTS FOR THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WAS PROMISED AND WHAT WE GOT INSTEAD. PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED THAT PREMIUMS WOULD FALL FOR FAMILIES. IT IS ESTIMATED, BY THE PRESIDENT'S OWN TEAM, THAT THEY WILL INCREASE OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. RIGHT HERE, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BASED ON THE RATE FILINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE, NEXT YEAR PREMIUMS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ANYWHERE FROM 20%-50%. PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. BASED ON PROJECTIONS, EVEN AFTER SPENDING ONE TRILLION'S OF DOLLARS, THERE WILL STILL BE PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE. IT TURNS OUT THAT BEING ON MEDICAID IS NOT NECESSARILY A BETTER DEAL THAN BEING UNINSURED. FOR THOSE POLICY WONKS IN THE CROWD, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE OREGON STUDY THAT ANALYZED PEOPLE WITH INSURANCE, AND THOSE RECEIVING MEDICAID. THEY FOUND THAT THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE ASK A GOT BETTER QUALITY CARE. THE NOTION THAT ACCESS TO INSURANCE YIELDS BETTER RESULTS MAY NOT BE THE CASE IF YOU LOOK AT THE POOR QUALITY OF MEDICAID THAT IS TIED DOWN MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF REGULATIONS AND RULES IMPOSED BY WASHINGTON, D.C. THE OBAMACARE WEBSITE, ONE OF THE CLASSIC DISASTERS IN MODERN HISTORY, HAS NOW BEEN OVERHAULED AT THE COST OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO GOT AN OBAMACARE SUBSIDY FOUND OUT LATER THAT THEY OWED AN AVERAGE OF $730 TO THE IRS. PEOPLE WHO SIGNED UP FOR AN OLD OBAMACARE PLAN ARE FIGHTING THAT ONE THIRD OF THE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ARE NOT IN THEIR NETWORKS. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE JUMPING OUT OF THE PLAN, ACCORDING TO ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" STORY THAT I READ YESTERDAY IS GROWING AS PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY OUT OFF POCKET COST, AND IT IS BETTER TO PAY THE FINE. YOU COULD NOT ESCAPE THIS EVEN IF YOU WEAR O WHERE ON MEDICAID BECAUSE THE MANDATES ARE CREATING IMPOSITIONS FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES. ALL OF THIS IS BEING DONE WITH THE LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN MODERN HISTORY. ON THE BACKS OF BUSINESSES AND AMERICAN WORKERS. HE OPPOSED THESE ROLES THAT REQUIRE COMPANIES TO REDUCE HOURS FOR WORKERS. MARKETS WORK THIS WAY. THE MINUTE YOU CREATE SOME SORT OF ROLE OR IMPOSITION, MARKETS ADJUST. THAT MEANS MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN HOURS ARE GONE. IT IS QUITE A LEGACY, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE WRECKAGE, IT MAKES YOU WONDER, HOW COULD ANYBODY SUPPORT THIS NOW? WELL, HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTS IT, AND SO DOES BERNIE SANDERS, AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS. THE DEBATE TONIGHT IN LAS VEGAS WILL PROBABLY PROVE THAT THEY WILL BE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS TOP-DOWN PROGRAM THAT IS STIFLING OUR ABILITY TO RISE UP. FOR THE DEMOCRATS, THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. THIS IS WHAT THEY LIKE. THEY LIKE THE POWER DECIDING THESE THINGS FROM UP ABOVE. I BELIEVE THE TOP DOWN APPROACH IS NOT THE ONE FOR OUR COUNTRY. WHETHER IT IS ENERGY POLICY, HEALTH CARE POLICY, ACROSS THE BOARD, WE ARE A BOTTOM-UP NATION. WE DO MUCH BETTER WHEN WE EMPOWER PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES, RATHER THAN GET IN LINE, AND BE TOLD WHAT TO DO. THAT IS WHAT OBAMACARE IS. THERE IS NO WAY TO FIX IT, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. YOU CANNOT FIX SOMETHING THAT WAS A FAILURE FROM THE START. WE HAVE TO START OVER. WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE WITH A SYSTEM THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE THE SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISES AND SYSTEMS OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY. LET ME TELL YOU HOW I WILL GET IT DONE. I WILL FOCUS ON HOW HEALTH CARE SHOULD LOOK LIKE. WE NEED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR 2025 NOT 1975. POSITIVE DISRUPTION SHOULD BE OUR FRIEND, NOT OUR ADVERSARY. WE SHOULD LIBERATE OUR SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR MORE INNOVATION TO TAKE PLACE. THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE SMARTPHONES THAT CAN VIDEO CHAT WITH OUR DOCTORS AND CAREGIVERS. WE HAVE GENOMIC MEDICINE. WE HAVE 3-D PRINTERS. MEDICINE HAS CHANGED. IT IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING. WE HAVE TO GET WASHINGTON OUT OF THE WAY, STOP ITS MICROMANAGEMENT, SO WE CAN HAVE AN EXPLOSION OF DYNAMIC RESPONSES TO THE GREAT CHALLENGES WE FACE, AND TURN THEM INTO OPPORTUNITIES, NOT JUST FOR OUR BETTER HEALTH, BUT FOR ECONOMIC PROGRESS FOR ALL OF US. I BELIEVE, AS I HOPE YOU DO, LIVES ARE SAVED BY BOLD INNOVATION. WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE WASHINGTON DOES NOT GET IN THE WAY. IF WE RELY ON THE REGULATORS OF WASHINGTON, D.C. TO DECIDE WHAT HEALTH CARE WE SHOULD GET, WE WILL CONTINUE TO GET FRUSTRATION, HIGHER COST, AND A LOT MORE COMPLEXITY, OR WORSE. LOOK AT THE V.A. SCANDAL THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND MANY ON THE LEFT HAVE USED THE V.A. HOSPITAL SYSTEM AS A MODEL FOR A GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED HEALTH CARE, BRAGGING ABOUT HOW GREAT IT IS. THE DELAYS AND DECEPTIONS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. WE HAVE BEEN WARNED. IF THAT IS THE BEST THAT WASHINGTON CAN DO, I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WE NEED TO UNLEASH THE POWER OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, DOCTORS, NURSES, ENTREPRENEURS, WHO ARE INVENTING THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE. ADVANCE SCREENINGS ONLY REQUIRE THE STATE OF A FINGER. GENOMIC MEDICINE, SO TREATMENTS MATCH EACH PERSON'S PHYSIOLOGY. ANDN APP ON YOUR SMART PHONE THAT CALLS A DOCTOR TO YOUR DOOR, JUST LIKE IT DOES A CARD TO PICK YOU UP. I WHAT ALL OF US TO EMBRACE THIS CHANGE SO WE CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WITH CONFIDENCE. DID THE PATIENT GET THE CARE HE OR SHE NEEDED? DID HER HEALTH IMPROVE? WAS THERE A MORE EFFICIENT OR AFFORDABLE WAY TO GET TO THE BEST RESULT? MY PLAN, THEREFORE, FOCUSES ON FIVE KEY STEPS. FIRST, REPEAL OBAMACARE. THAT MEANS ALL OF ITS MANDATE, PENALTIES, NEW SPENDING, THE ARBITRARY PICKING AND CHOOSING OF THE PARTS OF THE LAW THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED, AND THE ONES THAT DON'T. ALL OF THAT GOES AWAY. ESPECIALLY THE NEW TAXES ON MEDICAL DEVICES, DRUGS, AND INSURANCE, ALL OF WHICH DRIVE UP THE COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR MIDDLE INCOME AMERICANS. SECOND, INSTEAD OF PUNISHING INNOVATION, WE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON IT. I PLAN WOULD AGGRESSIVELY SUPPORT GROUNDBREAKING WORK AT THE NIH AND OUR COUNTRY'S F FINENESS RESEARCHERS. IF WE STARTED FROM SCRATCH, IF WE DID NOT HAVE A SYSTEM OF HOW WE ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES FOR THE RESEARCH THAT GOES ON, AND IF WE START FROM SCRATCH WITH THE FDA, I CAN PROMISE YOU IT WOULD BE A LES MORE STRATEGIC. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO MAKE MEDICAL RECORD KEEPING EFFICIENT, SHAREABLE, AND SECURE. THE PRESIDENT HAD A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS, BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUNDING, THROUGH THE STIMULUS, WAS NOT FOCUSED ON MAKING A SHARED PLATFORM FOR ALL OF US TO BENEFIT. WE HAVE HUGE COMPLICITY -- COMPLEXITY IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND THAT IS NOT SHARED. WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS OF DRUG PRODUCTION AND APPROVAL SO POTENTIAL DRUGS CAN REACH PATIENTS MORE SAFELY AND QUICKLY. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO CREATE A CONSENSUS, AS WE DID IN THE 1960'S, WHEN JOHN F. KENNEDY SUGGESTED WE LAUNCH A MAN TO THE MOON. I THINK WE NEED TO DO THE SAME THING AS WE CREATE AN ASPIRATIONAL GOAL TO INVESTIGATE AND EXPLORE THE BRAIN. THINK OF ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY TODAY BECAUSE WE LIKEA BEHIND ON UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BRAING OPERATES. AUTISM, ALZHEIMER'S, MENTAL ILLNESS. ALL OF THESE ILLNESSES IN A COUNTRY LIKE OURS WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF RESOURCES LIKE OURS -- IF WE WERE STRATEGIC, WE NEED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ASPIRATIONAL AND STRATEGIC AND HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THIS. INNOVATION LED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL BE AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING WE DO. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET BETTER CARE AT LOWER COST. WE NEED TO SEX WHERE THE INTERN -- WE NEED TO FIX WORTHY WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE. IN MY SIDE, WE WOULD PROPOSE TAX CREDITS TO THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE SO THEY CAN PAY FOR AFFORDABLE AND PORTABLE INSURANCE THAT PROVIDES PREVENTATIVE CARE AND ALSO COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE FOR MAJOR MEDICAL EVIDENCE. THIS WILL HELP MIDDLE-CLASS HOUSEHOLDS WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY QUALIFY FOR OBAMA CARE SUBSIDIES AND HAVE BEEN SLAMMED BY HIGHER PREMIUMS OUT ABOUT MY OBAMACARE. WE WILL MAKE IT USER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO GET COVERAGE. TODAY, AS A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON, IT IS EITHER OR. EITHER YOU PROVIDE COVERAGE, OR YOU DON'T. A BETTER APPROACH WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOWER COST BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE CARE, BUT IF THEY WANTED TO B PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET THEIR OWN CARE IN A LESS MEDITATIVE FORM OF ACCESS TO CARE, THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT, AND THAT SHOULD BE A TAX WRITE OFF FOR THEM. WE WILL GIVE PEOPLE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED FOR MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEIR OUT OF COST PAYS AND CO-PAYS. THE SYSTEM WOULD WORK FAR BETTER. NAME A SYSTEM WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CONSUMER ENGAGED IN MAKING DECISIONS, YOU GET A GOOD RESULT. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. THE BEST SYSTEM IS ONE WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY ENGAGED, WHERE WE HAVE TRANSPARENT INFORMATION FOR THEM TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEMSELVES. WHERE THERE IS SUPPORT FOR THEM TO HAVE THE KINDS OF INSURANCE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO GROW AND PROSPER, ALONG WITH A HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT, SO THEY ARE REWARDED FOR HEALTHY DECISIONS THEY MAKE GOING FORWARD. WHERE EVER THEY DON'T SPEND, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY. WE WILL GIVE THEM REAL TRANSPARENCY TO DECIDE WHICH HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WILL PROVIDE THE BEST VALUE. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WILL BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR RESULTS, AND THEY WILL REALLY COMPETE TO DESIGN THE NEW WAYS TO DELIVER CARE. THIS WILL REQUIRE SOME MAJOR CHANGES ON HOW WE REGULATE HEALTH INSURANCE. STATE, RATHER THAN WASHINGTON, D.C., ARE MUCH BETTER EQUIPPED TO SET THE STANDARDS. HERE IS WHAT I PROPOSE. WE WILL OPEN UP STATE INSURANCE MARKETS TO MUCH BROADER COMPETITION AND CHOICE. RIGHT NOW, OBAMACARE LOCKS IN A SMALL HANDFUL OF ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL MANDATED POLICIES ENGINEERED AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WE NEED TO BREAK UP THE MONOPOLY AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO DECIDE WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT. FOR EXAMPLE, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT WANT TO BUY A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN FOR UNEXPECTED EVIDENCE, THE TRUE FORM OF INSURANCE THAT SHOULD BE THE NORM, BUT MAYBE THEY WOULD WANT ALSO TO HAVE ONE THAT ADDS PREVENTATIVE CARE AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT WITH NO COST CARRY AT ALL. OR, PHYSICIANS MAY WANT TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT USES PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE THAT IDENTIFIES A CURE FOR CANCER. THE POSSIBILITY FOR INNOVATION ARE ENDLESS IF WE TRUST THE MARKETPLACE TO DO WHAT IT DOES SO WELL. IF PEOPLE ARE INFORMED, AND THEY MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE PROPER INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE, IF THE SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT, THE PROVIDERS OF INSURANCE AND CARE WILL RESPOND WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INNOVATION. PLANS TO PROTECT YOU IN CASE YOU GET SICK, AND PLANS WITH A FOCUS ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS LIKE HEART DISEASE WOULD BECOME THE NORM. PLANS THAT ARE PERFECT FOR DIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE, WHETHER THEY ARE SINGLE, WHETHER THEY HAVE A FAMILY, OR WHETHER THEY ARE RETIRED. LET ME BE CLEAR. EVERYONE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE TAX CREDITS THAT WILL HELP THEM BUY INSURANCE THAT PROTECTS THEM FROM LOSING THEIR LIFE SAVINGS FROM MAJOR MEDICAL EVIDENCE. THAT SHOULD BE THE NATIONAL FOCUS, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE SO THEIR LIVES ARE NOT TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BY AN ADVERSE EVENT THAT COULD HAVE TRAGIC RESULTS FOR THEIR FAMILY. WHATEVER THEY WANT INSURANCE TO COVER, PA THEY SHOULD BUY THAT. FRANKLY, THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS PART OF OBAMACARE, THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO DO THINGS AGAINST HER OWN CONSCIENCE. WE WOULD GET RID OF THAT. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE WILL ENSURE. WE WILL EXPECT THAT AFFORDABLE AMERICANS, REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MAKE, GET THE CARE AND OUTCOMES THEY DESERVE. HILLARY CLINTON SAYS THAT WILL HAPPEN UNDER MEDICAID. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WAS GOVERNOR FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA, I THINK WE HAVE THE FOURTH-LARGEST MEDICAID LAND. I CAN ROB US YOU THAT STATES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY FRUSTRATED WITH THE STATE PARTNERSHIP THAT IS MEDICAID. SPENDING MORE THROUGH A BROKEN SYSTEM IS NOT THE ANSWER. LET'S TRY A NEW APPROACH. LET'S LET THE STATES CREATE A SAFETY NET FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. IF WE TOOK THE MONEY THAT GOES TO MEDICAID, AND TO THE SUBSIDIES THAT GO TO OBAMACARE, AND PUT ASFCHIP IN THE MIX, I CAN PROMISE YOU WE WILL GET A BETTER RESULT. YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW? I DID A VERSION OF THAT IN OUR STATE OF FLORIDA WITH OUR MEDICAID PLAN. WE HAD A PILOT PLANT IN FORT LAUDERDALE AND JACKSONVILLE. WE CREATED TIERED PREMIUMS, WHERE WE EMPOWER THEM TO MAKE CHOICES. THIS NOTION THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT WITH THEIR FAMILIES -- WE OUGHT TO START REJECTING THAT. AMERICA DOES NOT DO THIS RIGHT, THIS TOP-DOWN BELIEVE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SMART, AND SOME PEOPLE AREN'T, I REJECT IT, AND I HOPE YOU DO AS WELL. I MEDICAID PLAN THAT EMPOWERS PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES, WILL GET FAR BETTER RESULTS. IMAGINE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU REWARD MAKING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE DECISIONS BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE MONEY TO MAKE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE DECISIONS NEXT YEAR, WHERE THERE IS COMPETITION, CHOICES WHERE PEOPLE TAKES THE PLAN FOR THEM. MAYBE THE HAVE A CHILD WITH ASTHMA. THEY ARE EMPOWERED TO MAKE MORE CHOICES BECAUSE THEY GET MORE FOR THE PREMIUM DOLLARS THAT THEY HAD. A SYSTEM THAT IS FOCUSED ON PEOPLE, RATHER THAN ON GOVERNMENT, WILL YIELD A FAR BETTERTHE NET RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT WE DIDN'T AT A LOWER COST THAN THE OLD MEDICAID PLAN. WE DID IT WITH HIGHER QUALITY. THE EFFICIENCY IS BASED ON OUTSIDE OBSERVATION STUDY SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS FAR BETTER FOR THEM. I BELIEVE THE STATES ARE THE PLACES WILL HAPPEN. WASHINGTON HAS HAD ITS CHANCE. IT HAS FAILED US MISERABLY. TRYING TO GET ANY CHANGE WITH WASHINGTON, IT NEARLY TAKES AN ACT OF GOD. WE BEGIN TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS IN A BETTER WAY. I WILL NOT ACCEPT THE STRAWMAN ARGUMENT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE OPPOSITE OF OBAMACARE IS NO CARE. THERE IS A BETTER WAY. IT DOES NOT MEAN WE GO TO THE WAY THINGS USED TO BE. WE ALSO HAVE ONE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS FOR OUR ECONOMY. AS YOU KNOW, MY ASPIRATION FOR THIS COUNTRY IS TO GROW IS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. IF WE WERE DOING THAT, I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT THE DEMANDS ON GOVERNMENT WILL SUBSIDE. THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE PEOPLE. THEY WILL BE WORKING FOR COMPANIES THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR PAY. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PUSH OFF THEIR HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE GREATEST OPPRESSION OF WAGES TODAY IS OBAMACARE. IT IS NOT WORKING. MORE OF THE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED AND PUT ON THE BACKS OF EMPLOYEES. TAKE-HOME PAY HAS DECLINED. WE ARE IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF A RECOVERY. DISPOSABLE INCOME IS LESS THAN IT WAS THE DAY RECOVERY STARTED. HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE PART OF THIS. MOVING TO A DIFFERENT SYSTEM WOULD MAKE IT WORK. ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE REPEALING OBAMACARE WOULD INCREASE GDP GROWTH I POINT 77%. OVER FIVE YEARS. THAT IS A BIG PART OF REACHING THE GOAL OF GROWTH. REPEALING OBAMACARE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED. IT HAS AN EQUIVALENT OF 4 MILLION FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT JOBS TO OUR ECONOMY. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING PART-TIME. THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME, THEY ARE STUCK IN A SYSTEM, BECAUSE OF THESE RULES, HAVING THESE ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED. NO MATTER HOW YOU EARN A LIVING, MY PLAN WILL GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL OVER HEALTH CARE. I REJECTED THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU HEAR FROM THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT, WHETHER IT IS SENATOR SANDERS OR HILLARY CLINTON, OR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT AMERICANS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS. THAT IS NOT THE AMERICAN WAY. IF YOU INFORM PEOPLE AND EMPOWER THEM WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION AND MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT SYSTEM I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT PEOPLE ARE SMART, THEY WILL ACT ON THEIR SELF INTEREST WHICH IS LOWER COST AND HIGHER QUALITY FOR THE FAMILY. I AM NOT AFRAID OF GIVING PEOPLE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE. I GOT TO DO THAT AS THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AS WELL. THE FIRST THING TO PUT ONLINE IS ALL THE COST AND PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL. HOSPITALS AT FIRST THOUGHT THIS WAS A RADICAL IDEA. THEN THEY REALIZE WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS? THEN THEY STARTED OFFERING CARE AND PROMOTING THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES AT LOWER COST. THINK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. THINK ABOUT THIS. IS IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE ECONOMY WHERE LOW-COST AND HIGHER QUALITY IS ASSUMED TO BE POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE? THE REST OF THE ECONOMY DOES THIS DAILY. ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIFE PUSHES THROUGH LOWER COST AND INNOVATION TO CREATE MORE MONEY, MORE PROSPERITY HIGHER QUALITY. HEALTH CARE NEEDS TO GET TO THAT AS WELL. THERE WILL BE AN EXPLOSION OF BENEFITS OR CONSUMERS AND FOR PEOPLE IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMY AND BETTER HEALTH IF WE TEAR DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT ARE SO COMMON SENSE AND EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY. FOR SOME ODD REASON PEOPLE CANNOT SEE HOW LOWER COST AND IMPROVE IF YOU DO THE RIGHT WAY. WE PREVENT ILLNESS AND WE CREATE A BETTER CHANCE FOR PEOPLE. IT WILL REQUIRE LEADERSHIP TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. WHETHER IT IS REGULATION, OR TAXES, OR EMBRACING THE ENERGY REVOLUTION, OR REFORM -- REFORMING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION, YOUNG PEOPLE AREN'T TOO MUCH DEBT. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT DEGREES ARE OBTAINED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOUNG PEOPLE TO BEGIN THEIR JOURNEY IN LIFE. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE BROKEN AS WE HAVE NOT HAD THE LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO FIX THEM. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE DO THIS IN HEALTH CARE IT WILL BE THE MOST EXCITING TIME TO BE ALIVE. THIS IS A CENTRAL ELEMENT OF WHAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO DO. I BELIEVE I HAVE THE SKILLS TO DO IT. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE GET THIS RIGHT, AS I SAID, WE WILL HAVE OUR GRANDCHILDREN LIVING -- HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE INHABITED, IF YOU ARE MY AGE. WE WILL HAVE A SOCIETY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE ENVY OF THE PLANET. I THINK IT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. I HOPE YOU DO AS WELL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

I'M ALSO PROUDLY A CO-CHAIR, ONE OF THE CO-CHAIRS OF SENATOR RUBIO'S COMMITTEE FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE.

YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WATCHING ON TV FOR YEARS ON C-SPAN, AND NOW I'M ACTUALLY ON IT. SO THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. YOU WALK IN, IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH OR ACOUSTIC PERFORMANCE, BECAUSE IT HAS THAT FEEL TO IT. I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THAT INTRODUCTION AND ALL OF YOU FOR COMING. THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS ACTUALLY, AS YOU WALK IN, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU'VE DONE THIS NOW, IT REALLY STRIKES YOU THAT THE PRESIDENCY IN THE UNITED STATES IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL OFFICE ON THE PLANET, AND YET THE PROCESS TO GET THERE BEGINS HERE IN PLACES JUST LIKE THIS, WHERE OUR FELLOW CITIZENS GET TO ENGAGE US AND ASK US QUESTIONS AND HEAR FROM US, AND SO IT'S REALLY REWARDING PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN, AND ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE THINGS THAT DIE. IT'S LIKE DOING AN EDITORIAL MEETING FIVE TIMES A DAY, BUT THE EDITORIAL BOARD ARE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE GOING SERVE IF THEY GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE, SO I'M GRATEFUL TO ALL OF OF YOU FOR BEING A PART OF THIS. SO I THINK I'LL BEGIN BY TELLING WHY YOU I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT ANYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE TO ANSWER. THE REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE I WANT THIS TO CONTINUE TO BE A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE CAN DO FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHAT MY PARENTS DID FOR ME AND WHAT YOUR PARENTS DID FOR YOU. FOR OVER TWO CENTURIES, UNIQUE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN A PLACE WHERE NO MATTER WHERE YOU STARTED OUT, NO MATTER HOW POOR YOUR PARENTS WERE, HOW DISCONNECTED FROM POWER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN, THIS WAS THE PLACE WHERE, IF YOU WORKED HARD AND YOU PERSEVERED, YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO GO AS FAR AS YOUR TALENT AND YOUR WORK WOULD TAKE YOU. THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE, THROUGH HARD WORK AND PERSEVERANCE, COULD ACHIEVE NOT JUST A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES, BUT AN EVEN BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND THE RESULT IS THE AMERICAN MIRACLE, EXEMPLIFIED BY THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND THAT'S WHY, FOR OVER TWO CENTURIES, WE HAVE BEEN A NATION WHERE EACH GENERATION HAS LEFT THE NEXT BETTER OFF THAN THEMSELVES. THAT AMERICAN DREAM IS WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL. EVEN THE POOREST COUNTRY ON THE PLANET HAS THE RICH. WHAT MAKES AMERICA SPECIAL IS PEOPLE WHO DON'T COME FROM WEALTH AND PRIVILEGE AND WHO MAY NEVER BE RICH STILL ACHIEVE HAPPINESS BECAUSE THEIR HARD WORK AND PERSEVERANCE, THEY ACHIEVE THE LIFE THEY WANTED. IF WE LOSE THAT WE STOP BEING SPECIAL. WE WILL STILL BE RICH AND POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT BUT WE WON'T BE SPECIAL. IF WE EVER BECOME A COUNTRY LIKE THE OTHER PLACES, WHERE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR LIFE IS DETERMINED BY WHAT YOUR PARENTS WERE OR DID, WE STOP BEING UNIQUE AND EXCEPTIONAL. IT SHOULD CONCERN US THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THAT DREAM AND ATTRIBUTE IS NO LONGER WITHIN REACH. IT SHOULD CONCERN US THAT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DON'T BELIEVE IT IS HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION BUT THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL LIVE A LIFE AS IT IS AROUND. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? TWO REASONS. WE ARE LOOKING FOR A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL TRANSFORMATION. THIS ECONOMY LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ECONOMY I GREW UP IN. NOT TO MENTION THE ONE IN 50 YEARS AGO. YET WE HAVE GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT DO NOT REFLECT THE ECONOMY. WHICH LEADS TO THE SECOND REASON. UNDER THE MODERN HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN THE POLITICAL CLASS IS SO OUT OF TOUCH THAN IT IS TODAY. I WISH I COULD SAY IT IS ONE POLITICAL PARTY BUT IT IS BOTH. LEADERS AND BOTH ARE OUT OF TOUCH AND OUTDATED. WHO DO NOT REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK OR NEVER DID. WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO OUR THOUSANDS IN STUDENT LOANS OR HAVE FORGOTTEN. WHO DON'T KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE WITH ALL REGULATIONS AND BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT. THE RESULT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF FRUSTRATION. THAT IS WHY THIS ELECTION MATTERS MORE THAN MOST. THIS IS NOT JUST A CHOICE BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTIES. THIS IS NOT JUST A CHOICE BETWEEN IDEOLOGIES. THE ELECTION OF 2016 IS A GENERATIONAL CHOICE. ABOUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE WILL BE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. EACH GENERATION OF AMERICANS HAS CHOICE IN KEEPING AMERICA A SPECIAL COUNTRY. NOW THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE THE SAME CHOICE. THERE ARE ONLY TWO. WE WILL EITHER BE THE FIRST AMERICANS TO LEAVE OUR CHILDREN WORSE OFF THAN OURSELVES, OR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WILL BE THE FREEST AND MOST PROSPEROUS THAT HAVE EVER LIVED. I AM CONFIDENT I KNOW WHICH ROAD YOU WANT TO CHOOSE. I AM CONFIDENT I KNOW THE ROAD THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WANT TO CHOOSE. I BELIEVE WE WILL CHOOSE A FUTURE BETTER THAN OUR PAST. A LIFE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN BETTER THAN OUR OWN. THERE ARE THINGS WE WILL HAVE TO DO AND HAVE TO DO THEM RIGHT NOW. THE FIRST IS BECOME GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY. IT IS AN ECONOMY DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE WE HAD NOT SO LONG AGO. THIS WILL REPORT OR TO TURN PAGE ON LEADERS AND IDEAS THAT NO LONGER WORK. AND EMBRACE IDEAS AND LEADERS RELEVANT TO THE 21ST CENTURY. WHAT IS GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE? HAVING LEADERS THAT UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GROW THE ECONOMY, THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOES. YOU WOULD KNOW THAT BY WATCHING LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. I CAUGHT ENOUGH TO KNOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS MORE LIBERAL THAN IT HAS BEEN ITS MICHAEL DUKAKIS, MAYBE BEFORE. LEADERS THAT WERE ARGUING HE WILL GROW THE ECONOMY BECAUSE WE WILL BUILD MORE ROADS AND BRIDGES. I LIKE THOSE AND IT MAY HELP, BUT ONLY THE PRIVATE SECTOR CREATES MORE JOBS AND BETTER PAYING JOBS. JOBS THAT PAY MORE AND PROVIDE UPWARD MOBILITY. THE JOB OF GOVERNMENT IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO SUCCEED, TO MAKE AMERICA THE CHEAPEST, FASTEST, EASIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS THAT PAY MORE. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO WORK ON OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES. WE NEED A TAX CODE THAT MAKES US GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE. HAVE A TAX CODE THAT MAKES US AMONG THE MOST COMPETITIVE AND IN SOME PLACES IN THE WORLD TO START A BUSINESS OR EXPAND AN EXISTING ONE. WE NEED A REGULATORY CODE THAT IS FLATTENED OUT AND SOME FOR FIGHT AND LESS BURDENSOME. WE HAVE BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF REGULATORY COST. THIS IS CRIPPLING ON SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CANNOT AFFORD THE ARMY OF LAWYERS AND LOBBYISTS NECESSARY. WE CANNOT FOR OUR ECONOMY. WE HAVE A DEBT CRISIS AND WE WILL HAVE ONE AT SOME POINT. THE OH CLOSE TO $19 TRILLION WHICH IS MORE THAN THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY. THERE ARE NO PLANS TO ADDRESS IT. THAT'S WHY WE MUST DEAL WITH THE DRIVERS. THE DRIVERS IS NOT FOREIGN AID, LESS THAN 1% OF THE BUDGET. IT IS NOT DEFENSE WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OBLIGATION. THE DRIVER OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT IS THE WAY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SOCIAL SECURITY. I AM FROM FLORIDA. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE ON MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. ONE OF THEM HAPPENS TO BE MY MOTHER. I CAN SAY THIS UNEQUIVOCABLY, I AM AGAINST CHANGES THAT FOR MY MOTHER. I'M AGAINST CHANGES BAD FOR PEOPLE LIKE HER. WE CAN SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING FOR HER, PEOPLE LIKE HER THAT ARE RETIRED, OR PEOPLE ABOUT TO RETIRE. HERE'S THE TRUTH PEOPLE CAN STARTED NOTCHING. MY MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND FOR THOSE YOUNGER THAN ME WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN IT WORKS FOR OUR PARENTS AND PEOPLE ON IT NOW. IT HAS TO EITHER NOT EXIST OR BE DIFFERENT. WHAT ARMY BY DIFFERENT? I MAY HAVE TO RETIRE SOONER THAN MY PARENTS. MY BENEFITS IF I MADE MONEY WILL NOT GROW AS FAST AS THEY DID FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT NOW. MY MEDICARE BENEFITS COULD BE THE OPTION OF TAKING THAT AND USING IT TO BUY A PRIVATE PLAN I LIKE BETTER. THAT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK TO ME AT 44, AFTER EVERYTHING MY 85-YEAR-OLD MOTHER DID FOR US. I SET HER AGE, SHE WILL GET MAD. MY OLDER MOTHER SAYS, THAT IS PROBABLY NOT GOOD EITHER. SHE IS ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICAIR. IT WILL WORK DIFFERENTLY THAN IT DID FOR PEOPLE LIKE US OR PEOPLE THAT ARE RETIRED OR ABOUT TWO. WE CAN BRING STABILITY TO THIS PROGRAM AND THE LONG-TERM AND WE CAN SAY THAT AND BALANCE OUR BUDGET AND WE DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING FOR THE PEOPLE ON IT NOW OR ABOUT TO RETIRE. BE GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE, WE CAN UTILIZE OUR ENERGY RESOURCES. WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF OIL. WE SHOULD EXPLORE MORE AND EXPORTED. THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON THE WORLD'S DRAMATIC. THE WORLD WOULDN'T HAVE TO BUY IT FROM A GANGSTER IN MOSCOW. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BUY IT FROM A RADICAL SHIA CLERIC. THEY CAN BORROW IT FROM THE MOST STABLE AND FREEST CON THREE -- COUNTRY ON THE PLANET. THIS WON'T JUST LOWER THE COST OF LIVING BY MAKING IT CHEAPER TO POWER UTILITIES, IT WILL BE EASIER TO MANUFACTURE ENERGY COSTS. OVERHEAD IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF MANUFACTURING. IF ENERGY BECOMES MORE AFFORDABLE, HE WILL HAVE A MANUFACTURING RENAISSANCE WHICH MEANS WE CAN BE A COUNTRY THAT MAKES THINGS AGAIN. NOT SIMPLY A COUNTRY THAT DOES THINGS ONLY. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, IF WE WANT TO BECOME GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE, WE MUST REPEAL AND REPLACE OF OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] WE MUST ARE PLACING WITH A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS EVERY AMERICAN TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE INSURANCE AND IDEAS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR OWN TAX MONEY, WHETHER IT IS YOUR OWN THAT CAME FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR COMES FROM A TAX EDIT AND YOU CAN USE IT TO BUY INSURANCE YOU DECIDED YOU WANT FROM ANY COMPANY ACROSS STATE LINES THAT WILL SELL IT TO YOU. THIS WILL DRIVE CHOICES AND COMPETITION AND LOWER PRICES ENDING GOOD AND IMPROVE COVERAGE. IT IS BETTER THAN PUTTING THE GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE. AND BETTER THAN THE PROGRAM WE HAVE NOW. [APPLAUSE] I AM CONFIDENT IF WE CAN DO THESE THINGS, THE AMERICAN PRIVATE SECTOR WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST. THESE ARE THE MOST INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE, AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. THE AMERICAN PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTED BY MANY NOT ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY WILL NOT ONLY CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS IF WE ALLOW THIS COUNTRY TO BE GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE, THEY WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF BETTER PAYING JOBS, THAT PAY SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. THOSE NEW JOBS WILL REQUIRE MORE SKILLS THAN EVER. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO IS MODERNIZE. WHAT WE MEAN IS SOME OF THE BEST JOBS OF THE 21ST CENTURY, LESS THAN FOUR YEARS OF TRADITIONAL COLLEGE. THAT'S WHY WE MUST REINVIGORATE VOCATIONAL TRAINING. WE NEED TO STOP TELLING YOUNG AMERICANS. NOTHING CAN BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. WE NEED TO PRODUCE MORE WEA ELDERS, MACHINISTS, AIRPLANE MECHANICS. WE SHOULD OPEN FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID SO THE STUDENTS CAN DO THAT. WHEN THEY GRADUATE, THEY DON'T JUST GET A DIPLOMA, THEIR INDUSTRY CERTIFIED AND READY TO WORK. SOME OF THE FASTEST-GROWING JOBS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED MORE COMPETITION AND CHOICES. THAT IS WHY I THINK WE NEED TO OPEN IT UP FOR MORE COMPETITION, INNOVATION, AND FOR TECHNOLOGY TO ENTER THE EDUCATION SPACE. PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW SOMEONE WHO IS 30 YEARS OLD WHO HAS TO WORK FULL-TIME AND RAISE A FAMILY TO GET READY FOR WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW. WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU SIT IN THE CLASSROOM AND TAKE VERSES ON WHAT YOU MASTERED ON YOUR OWN THROUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE. YOU GET CREDIT FOR WHAT YOU CAN PROVE YOU KNOW ARE LEARNED. AND WHATEVER YOU ARE MISSING FOR YOUR DEGREE, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN IT FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. CREATING AN ALTERNATIVE OF CREDITING PROCESSES THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO PACKAGE LEARNING FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES EMMA OPEN HIGHER EDUCATION WHO HAVE TO WORK FULL-TIME WHO AFFORD TO DROP EVERYTHING AND SIT IN THE CLASSROOM FOR 2-4 YEARS TO BECOME A PARALEGAL OR A DENTAL HYGIENIST OR ANY OF THESE OTHER PROFESSIONS THAT PAY MORE THAN THE JOB SOME ARE TRAPPED IN. WE WILL HAVE FOR YOUR COLLEGES BUT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE PEOPLE BORROWING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY FOR DEGREES THAT DON'T LEAD TO JOBS. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, WE WILL PASS A LAW CALLED RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO AND I WILL SIGN IT. HERE'S WHAT THE LAW SAYS. BEFORE ANY STUDENT TAKES OUT THE STUDENT LOAN, THE SCHOOL HAS TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THAT SCHOOL WITH THAT DEGREE SO YOU CAN DECIDE IF YOU WILL BORROW 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TAKE ON A DEGREE. HE DESERVED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BORROW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WHETHER YOU CAN FIND A JOB. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BAN THESE DEGREES OR SAY NO ONE CAN STUDY POLITICAL SCIENCE OR GREEK PHILOSOPHY. STUDY WHATEVER YOU WANT BUT YOU DESERVE TO KNOW THE MARKET FOR PHILOSOPHERS HAS TIGHTENED OVER THE LAST 2000 YEARS. IF WE CAN DO THESE TWO THINGS, MAKE AMERICA GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE AND CREATE POLICIES THAT MAKE IT EASIER AND CHEAPER FOR PEOPLE TO BE GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NOT HAVE AN ECONOMICAL RECOVERY. WE WILL HAVE A RENAISSANCE. THE GROWTH OF PROSPERITY UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE SEEN. THAT WILL MATTER IF WE DON'T TO THE THIRD THING, KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE. IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OBLIGATION. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE REASON WE HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEY ARE INVOLVED IN ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAVE NO BUSINESS. THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS IN K-12, WE DON'T NEED A COMMON CORE, A NATIONAL SCHOOL BOARD. THERE'S SOMETHING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO DO THAT ONLY THEY CAN DO AND THAT IS KEEP A SAFE. IT IS FAILING AT EVERY LEVEL. IT IS FAILING TO PROTECT OUR SOVEREIGNTY AS YOU HAVE SEEN WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT HAS NOT IMPROVED. IT HAS ALSO FAILED TO PROTECT US ABROAD. LOOK AT THE WORLD AROUND US. YOU HAVE A LUNATIC IN NORTH KOREA WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. . IRAN ABOUT TO RECEIVE $150 BILLION IN SANCTIONS RELIEF WHICH THEY WILL USE TO BUILD VESSELS -- MISSILES. YOU HAVE A GANGSTER IN MOSCOW THREATENING NATO AND TO DIVIDE EUROPE AND SOWING INSTABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU HAVE RADICAL JIHADIST GROUPS ACROSS MULTIPLE CONTINENTS THAT ARE NOT JUST THREATENING NEIGHBORS, THEY ARE RECRUITING AMERICANS. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, YOU HAVE THE CHINESE RAPIDLY EXPANDING THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITIES, TAKING OVER THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND HACKING OUR COMPUTERS, STEALING OUR SECRETS. THE PRIVATE INFORMATION OF AMERICANS. IN THE FACE OF THESE THREATS, WHAT ARE WE DOING UNDER BARACK OBAMA? DEMORALIZING AND DESTROYING OUR MILITARY WITH A SHORTSIGHTED DEFENSE CUT THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET. THE SEQUESTER DOESN'T DO A THING, BECAUSE DEFENSE BENDING BEST SPENDING IS NOT -- IS IT IS THE REASON WHY ONE DAY WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE COMMITMENT WE MAKE TO OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM WHICH IS THIS, WE WILL NEVER PUT THEM IN A FAIR FIGHT, THEY WILL HAVE BETTER WEAPONS, BETTER TRAINING, AND BETTER INFORMATION THAN THEIR ADVERSARY. THIS IS A PROMISE WE HAVE MADE TO OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT PROMISE IF WE KEEP DESTROYING DEFENSE SPENDING. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, IT WILL BE MY HIGHEST PRIORITY TO RESTORE OUR MILITARY AND ENSURE IT HAS SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY. WHEN THEY COME HOME AFTER TAKING CARE OF US, WE WILL HAVE A BE A SYSTEM THAT TAKES CARE OF VETERANS. -- A VA SYSTEM THAT TAKES CARE OF VETERANS. A SYSTEM WHERE IT SOMEONE ISN'T DOING THEIR JOB THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET FIRED. I'M PROUD I PASSED A LAW THAT ALLOWS THE V.A. SECRETARY TO FIRE EXECUTIVES THAT ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. THEY HAVE ONLY FIRED ONE PERSON. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, PEOPLE WILL GET FIRED IF THEY DON'T DO THEIR JOBS. THE OTHER THING IS, WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS FOLLOWS THAT VETERANS, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE A VETERAN AND IF SOMEONE THERE CANNOT SEE YOU IN A TIMELY FASHION EMMA YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE BENEFITS TO ANY HOSPITAL OR PROVIDER THAT CAN SEE YOU AND WILL TAKE UPON THE PAYMENT WE NEED A FOREIGN POLICY OF CLARITY. IT MEANS THIS. OUR ALLIES KNOW THEY CAN TRUST US AND OUR ADVERSARIES KNOW NOT TO TEST US. WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THERE'S ONLY ONE PRO-AMERICAN FREE ENTERPRISE DEMOCRACY THERE, ISRAEL. TODAY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT TREATS THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL WITH LESS RESPECT THAN HE TREATS THE AYATOLLAH AND IRAN. IF I'M PRESIDENT, OUR ALLIES WILL KNOW THEY CAN RELY ON US AND OUR ADVERSARIES WILL KNOW NOT TO TEST US. IF WE CAN DO ALL OF THIS, PROTECT OUR COUNTRY FROM THREATS, IF WE CAN REBUILD OUR ECONOMY BY MAKING A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE, AND IF WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER, FASTER, AND CHEAPER FOR PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO BENEFIT FROM THE NEW ECONOMY, THE 21ST CENTURY WILL BE THE GREATEST ERA IN OUR HISTORY. IF WE FAIL, DO NOTHING, YOU AND I WILL BE PART OF THE FIRST GENERATION IN HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY THAT LEAVES OUR CHILDREN WERE SOFT -- WORSE OFF THAN OURSELVES. I APPOINTED AT ALL THESE CHALLENGES PRIMARILY TO LET YOU KNOW WE CAN FIX THEM ALL. HERE IS THE TRUTH, THIS IS NOT NEWS. THIS NATION HAS ALWAYS FACED GREAT CHALLENGES. OURS IS NOT THE STORY OF A COUNTRY THAT HAD IT EASY. OURS IS A STORY OF A NATION THAT FOR OVER TWO CENTURIES HAS ALWAYS CONFRONT A GREAT CHALLENGES AND HAS FACED THEM, OVERCOME THEM, AND EMBRACE THESE OPPORTUNITIES. A NATION FOUNDED OUT OF A GREAT CHALLENGE. DECLARE YOUR INDEPENDENCE FROM THE MOST HARMFUL EMPIRE AND THE WORLD, THAT WAS A GREAT CHALLENGE -- MOST POWERFUL EMPIRE AT THE TIME, GREAT CHALLENGE. THEN THIS WAS A NATION THAT HAD TO CONFRONT A GREAT WORLD WAR. AND A GREAT DEPRESSION. AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR. AND THE COLD WAR. AND THE 1960'S, WHERE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA, THE VIETNAM WAR, LYRICAL ASSASSINATIONS THAT HAPPENED ALL SEEMED TO RIP THE NATION AT THE SEAMS. AND TIME OFAND AGAIN THE NATION HAD TO DO WHAT IT HAD TO DO. WE RAISE OUR CHALLENGES AND EMBRACE OPPORTUNITIES. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TODAY INHERITED FROM THE AMERICAN SECOND BEFORE US NOT A PERFECT COUNTRY, BUT THE BEST ONE. AND THE NATION BETTER THAN WHAT THEY GREW UP IN. OUR TIME HAS COME. NOW THE TIME HAS COME FOR THIS GENERATION TO DO ITS PART. THAT IS WHY THIS ELECTION IS IMPORTANT. WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE JUST KEEP ELECTING THE SAME PEOPLE WITH THE SAME IDEAS. WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE KEEP PROMOTING THE NEXT PERSON IN LINE OR THE MOST FAMILIAR NAME WHAT A PERSON THE EXPERTS TELL US WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR. WE HAVE TO TURN THE PAGE AND ELEVATE NEW LEADERS WITH NEW IDEAS RELEVANT TO THE TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE BEING ASKED TO DO. THIS IS WHY SUPPORT TERM LIMITS AND WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WHY AFTER FOUR YEARS IN THE SENATE I CHOSE NOT TO RUN FOR REELECTION AND ASPIRE TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND. IF WE KEEP ELECTING THE SAME PEOPLE, NOTHING WILL CHANGE. WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR THE SENATE FOR AND HALF YEARS AGO, THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ALIGNED AGAINST ME ON BEHALF OF MY OPPONENT WHO WAS THE SITTING GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL, OBVIOUSLY. WHEN I CHOSE TO RUN, SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE CAME OUT AGAIN TO TELL ME IT WASN'T MY TURN. THAT I HAD TO WAIT IN LINE. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A LINE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE WAITING FOR. WE CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER FOUR YEARS LIKE THE LAST EIGHT. IF WE HAVE ANOTHER, THE SPEECH I JUST GAVE YOU, I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE IT. IT MAY NOT BE TRUE THAT WE CAN SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AVOID BIDDING OUR CHILDREN -- AVOID LEAVING OUR CHILDREN WORSE THAN OURSELVES. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS ARE CALLED TO DO OUR PART. SOME OF YOU HAVE. I CAN SEE FROM YOUR HATS AND SHIRTS THAT YOU ARE VETERANS THAT SERVED IN UNIFORM AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO DO IT IN PUBLIC OFFICE. I HAVE ALWAYS APPROACHED IT WITH ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT AMERICA DOESN'T ONLY A THING -- OWE ME A THING. I HAVE A DEBT TO AMERICA I WILL NEVER FULLY REPAY. FOR ME, IT IS NOT JUST THE COUNTRY I WAS BORN IN. THIS IS THE NATION THAT HAS CHANGED THE HISTORY OF MY FAMILY. NEITHER OF MY PARENTS WERE BORN IN AMERICA. THEY WERE BORN ON THE ISLAND OF CUBA. THE FAMILIES THAT WEREN'T RICH, POWERFUL, DISCONNECTED FROM PRIVILEGE. THEY CAME TO AMERICA IN 1956 BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONE PLACE ON EARTH WHERE PEOPLE LIKE THEM, THROUGH HARD WORK, HAD A CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE. MY FATHER HAD A DIFFICULT. WHEN HE WAS FOUR DAYS SHY OF HIS NINTH BIRTHDAY, HIS MOTHER PASSED AWAY. MY FATHER HAD TO STOP GOING TO SCHOOL. HE WOULD WORK TO THE NEXT 70 YEARS OF HIS LIFE. IN AMERICA, MY PARENTS HAD ALL SORTS OF JOBS. MY MOTHER BUILT ALUMINUM CHAIRS IN A FACTORY. AND SHE WAS A CASHIER AT A COFFEE SJOHOP. THEN A HOTEL IN MIAMI BEACH. THEN SHE WAS A MADE IN LAS VEGAS AND A STOCK CLERK IN MIAMI. MY FATHER WAS PRIMARILY A BARTENDER. HE WORKED ON NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. ON DAYS I'M SURE HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WORKING. THAT WASN'T THE DREAM HE WANTED FOR HIMSELF, HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR HIS WORK, BUT WHEN HE WAS YOUNG, HE HAD BIG DREAMS BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE DO. HIS DREAMS BECAME IMPOSSIBLE. WHEN THEY CAME TO AMERICA, THEY FOUND A NEW DREAM AND PURPOSE. TO GIVE US THE CHANCE TO DO THE THINGS THEY NEVER COULD. THEY DIDN'T WANT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM TO HAPPEN TO US. THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE DOORS THAT HAVE CLOSED FOR THEM WOULD BE OPEN FOR THEIR CHILDREN THAT'S WHY MY PARENTS WORKED SO HARD, MY FATHER IN PARTICULAR. HE STAYED BEHIND A SMALL PORTABLE BAR FOR DECADES SO I COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO BE WHATEVER MY TALENT AND WORK WITH ALLOW ME TO BE. THE JOURNEY FROM BEHIND THAT PORTABLE BAR TO WHERE I AM TODAY, FOR ME, THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. IT IS WHAT MAKES US A SPECIAL COUNTRY AND DIFFERENT. IT IS NOT JUST MY STORY, AS AMERICANS, IT IS OUR STORY. WHO AMONG US IS NOT JUST A GENERATION REMOVED? WE ARE ALL JUST A GENERATION OR TWO REMOVED FROM SOMEONE WHO MADE OUR FUTURE THE PURPOSE OF THEIR LIVES. IT REMINDS US THAT WHETHER OR NOT WE REMAIN A SPECIAL COUNTRY WILL BE DETERMINED BY WHETHER OR NOT THAT JOURNEY IS STILL POSSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT. THAT IS THE GREAT CALLING OF OUR TIME. WE MUST WANT TO SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM, BUT WE WANT TO EXPAND ITS WHAT IT REACHES MORE PEOPLE AND CHANGES MORE LIVES. THAT FUTURE IS WITHIN OUR REACH. I AM HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND DO WHAT IT TAKES TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT AND KEEP IT. AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO OUT AND FIND MORE PEOPLE. I BELIEVE IF WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER, WE WON'T JUST CHANGE OUR PARTY, WE WILL CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. IN SO DOING, WE WILL BE HELD TO SAY THAT OUR CHILDREN WERE LEFT WITH A COUNTRY BETTER THAN OUR OWN. AND THE 21ST CENTURY WASN'T AS GOOD AS THE 20TH, IT WAS BETTER. IT WAS A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY. THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO YOU. I LOOK FOR TO YOUR QUESTIONS. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GET STARTED. IS THERE ONE OR TWO MICROPHONES? WE HAVE TWO. PLEASE FIND THE YOUNG MAN AND YOUNG LADY WITH A FLAG. LET THEM FLAG YOU DOWN, I GUESS. YES SIR. >> MY QUESTION IS HOW DID YOUR FAITH AFFECT WHAT YOU DO? MR. RUBIO: IN TERMS OF MY LIFE FOR POLITICS? MY FAITH HAS A HUGE INFLUENCE ON ME. IT TEACHES ME TO CARE FOR THE LESS FORTUNATE. THE FIRST THING I LEARNED FROM MY FAITH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB I HAVE IS AS HUSBAND AND FATHER. THE MOST IN FULL UNTIL JOB I WILL EVER HAVE IS THE 15 THROUGH 17 YEARS I HAVE TO INFLUENCE MY CHILDREN. NOT JUST BY WHAT I SAY TO THEM BUT BY WHAT THEY SEE ME DO. PUBLIC SERVICE INFLUENCES ME AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED ON SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES. THE NOTION WE ARE CREATED EVE WILL -- EQUAL WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS, LIFE, LIBERTY, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS. I BELIEVE EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS AND THE JOB OF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT. BEYOND THAT I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I'VE COME TO BE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF FREE ENTERPRISE. IT IS THE ONLY ECONOMIC AND THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THE POTENTIAL EVEN IF THEY AREN'T BORN INTO GREAT WEALTH AND PRIVILEGE. TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD HERE IS WHAT YOU WILL FIND. THE MORE GOVERNMENT DOMINATES THE ECONOMY, THE MORE PEOPLE INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT AT THE SPENCER EVERYONE ELSE. YOU WILL FIND SOCIETIES WITH THE SAME RICH FAMILIES AND SAME BIG COMPANIES THAT DOMINATED THOSE COUNTRIES DECADE AFTER DECADE. ONLY IN FREE ENTERPRISE CAN AN EMPLOYEE BECOME AN EMPLOYER. ONLY IN FREE ENTERPRISE CAN SOMEONE THAT IS BORN INTO A FAMILY THAT ISN'T POOR OR CONNECTED, THROUGH HARD WORK, DISCIPLINE, SELF-CONTROL, AND TALENT ACHIEVE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND MAYBE PUT THEIR FORMER BOSS OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE YOU ARE BETTER. THAT IS WHY I LOVE FREE ENTERPRISE. THE ONLY WAY TO ERADICATE POVERTY IS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO FIND BETTER PAYING JOBS. FREE ENTERPRISE DOES THAT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MODEL IN THE WORLD. MY FAITH HAS INFLUENCED ME TO CARE ABOUT THE LESS FORTUNATE. I SUPPORT A SAFETY NET. I DON'T THINK IT WORKS WITHOUT ONE. I ALSO KNOW THE SAFETY NET CANNOT BE A WAY OF LIFE. IT CANNOT BECOME A LIFESTYLE. IT HAS BECOME THAT FOR MANY. MY FAITH TEACHES ME THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE SOUL OR FOR PEOPLE OR THEIR ASPIRATIONS. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I AM GLAD MY FAITH INFLUENCES MY ROLE IN GOVERNMENT AND HOW I GOVERN MYSELF. [APPLAUSE] >> WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS ASK YOU A QUESTION. I FEEL AND COMFORTABLE SAYING IT. I HAVE WATCHED YOUR SPEECH A COUPLE OF TIMES, I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING NEW SO I WANT YOU TO SAY SOMETHING NEW. MY QUESTION IS ABOUT NEW YEAR'S SPENDING. YOU SAID BEFORE AND I AGREE THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IS MILITARY. YOU ALSO SAID YOU WOULDN'T CUT YOUR MOTHER'S SOCIAL SECURITY. TWO THINGS I REALLY LIKE. I HAVE A HARD TIME BALANCING THE TWO AND THAT MILITARY SPENDING HAS BEEN CUT RECENTLY BUT WE ARE INVESTING IN SUPER JETS, WE HAVE MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF BASES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THERE'S A LOT OF WASTE IN OUR PENTAGON SPENDING. I DON'T WANT TAXES TO BE RAISED TO PAY FOR GOVERNMENT SPENDING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT IN THIS AUDIENCE THAT ARE GOING TO SUFFER WITH A CUT IN SOCIAL SECURITY. MR. RUBIO: THE ME BEGIN BY SAYING DEFENSE SPENDING IS NOT THE REASON WE HAVE THE DEBT. I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT WASTE. I DON'T LIKE IT IN ANY PROGRAM EVEN IF IT IS A SMALL PORTION OF OUR BUDGET. I DO SUPPORT REFORMS AND WE NEED MORE COMPETITION AND DEFENSE CONTRACTING. MANY OF YOU IN BUSINESS KNOW THIS, THERE'S ONLY ONE BIDDER ON THE PROJECT AND YOU WON'T GET A GOOD PRICE. NO DOUBT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE THREATS THIS NATION FACES ARE SIGNIFICANT. ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF GLOBAL INSTABILITY ARE GREATER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH, THE MOST IMPORTANT, THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, WE ARE ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED BY GLOBAL INSTABILITY. ONE THING THAT HELPS ENSURE STABILITY IS A STRONG U.S. MILITARY. IT PREVENTS WAR. EVERY TIME WE HAVE CUT DEFENSE SPENDING SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAD TO CUT BACK AND IT COST MORE MONEY. THE MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE DEBT, THE ISSUE ISN'T JUST THE SHEER AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WE GO, IT IS WHAT IT REPRESENTED AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR ECONOMY. IT IS TOO LARGE. THINK OF THE ECONOMY AS A PIE AND THE DEBT IS A SLICE. TODAY, THE DEBT IS AS BIG AS THE PIE. THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THAN AMICK AND SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, THAT MAKES THE ECONOMY BIGGER, BUT ALSO REFORMS OUR WHOLE LINE ON SPENDING INCREASES IN THE FUTURE. THE MAJORITY AS MANY INCREASES IN THE FUTURE WILL COME FROM MANDATORY SPENDING PROGRAMS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS WHEN THEY RETIRE, PEOPLE LIKE ME AND MY CHILDREN. THOSE PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD US IF WE DO NOT MAKE REFORMS ON HOW THEY WORK FOR US. THE GOOD NEWS IS, IF WE CAN MAKE THOSE REFORMS NOW, WE CAN BRING THOSE MANDATORY SPENDING PROGRAMS, THE ART OF THE SPENDING, UNDER CONTROL. WE ALSO HAVE TO DO THE ECONOMIC GROWTH PART OF IT, SWEAT TALKED ABOUT HOW WE CAN GROW THE ECONOMY. SEPARATE THE DEBT UNDER A MANAGEABLE LEVEL. IF OUR DEBT WAS TO CHILEAN DOLLARS, THAT 19 -- IF IT WAS $2 TRILLION, NOT $19 TRILLION, WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THE ECONOMY BIGGER AND HOLD THE LINE ON THE GROWTH AND OUR DEBT BY REFORMS TO THE MANDATORY SPENDING PROGRAMS. THAT BRINGS A SPENDING ON A ART THAT IS MORE SUSTAINABLE AND SUBMITTED IT BECOMES MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE. CUTTING DEFENSE SPENDING HAS NEVER WORKED, CUTTING WASTE ABSOLUTELY, BUT CUTTING DEFENSE SPENDING HAS NEVER WORKED, WE NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR LONG-RANGE BOMBER. ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR NUCLEAR TRIAD IS THE OHIO CLASS SUBMARINES, WE STILL NEED MORE THOSE SAYS THAT YOU MENTIONED BECAUSE CELL TECHNOLOGY HAS NEVER MATTERED MORE THAN THE -- IN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE ARE ON TRACK TO HAVE THE OLDEST AND STRONGEST NAME -- SMALLEST BABY IN THE COUNTRY AT A TIME WHEN OUR POTENTIAL ADVERSARIES IS EXPANDING THEIR OWN -- EXPANDING THEIR OWN CAPABILITIES. THE CHINESE ARE UNDERGOING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE MILITARY EXPANSION AND A HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE NORTH KOREANS POSSESSED DOZENS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND A LONG-RANGE MISSILE THAT CAN ALREADY HIT THE UNITED STATES. THE IRANIANS ARE ABOUT TO GET $150 BILLION IN SANCTIONS RELIEF , WHICH THEY WILL NOT USE TO BUILD BRIDGES -- BRIDGES AND HOSPITALS. THEY WILL USE IT TO BUILD LONG-RANGE MISSILES BACK AND HIT THE UNITED STATES, AND EVENTUALLY THEY WILL USE IT TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON OR BY ONE. THESE ARE REAL THREATS, AND THAT OF THESE THINGS I WILL TALK ABOUT MATTER IF WE ARE NOT SAFE AND MILITARY COMPONENT OF THIS IS CRITICAL. [APPLAUSE] YES, -- >> WHILE YOU WERE IN THE SENATE, I LOOKED UP AND DISCOVER THAT YOU MISSED MORE VOTES THAN ANYBODY THERE, REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, OVER 8%. ALSO ONE LAST WEEK WHICH HAD TO DO WITH MILITARY SPENDING. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR REASON FOR THAT. >> I'M HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TALKING TO YOU. I HAVE BEEN IN THE SENATE FOR FOUR YEARS AND I AM PROUD TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA AND THE UNITED STATES. PEOPLE COME TO YOUR OFFICE, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A DRY FOOD -- DRIVE-THROUGH AT MCDONALD'S AND A WOMAN CAME TO HIS -- CAME TO BE WITH A STORY OF HER FAMILY AND I WAS HAPPY TO HELP. I HAVE VETERANS WITH ISSUES AT THE V.A.. WE LOVE DOING THAT VERY MUCH. I AM FRUSTRATED, I AM IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WATCHING ALL THESE PROBLEMS AND NOTHING IS HAPPENING. THEN I SEE, WE WHEN THE MAJORITY IN 2014 AND STILL NOTHING HAPPENS. NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE IT WAS BEFORE THE RIGHT PERSON IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. TO RUN MEANS YOU WILL MISS VOTES, EVERYBODY WHO IS EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT OUT OF THE SENATE HAS MISSED VOTES. I'M NOT ON VACATION, I AM HERE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE OF AMERICA AND I HOPE WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CAMPAIGN SO WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO THE NEXT TIME THEY TAKE VOTES IN THE SENATE, IT WILL NOT BE SHOW VOTES, BOTH CAN ACTUALLY PASS AND WE WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT CAN ACTUALLY SIGN THINGS LIKE THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. [APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN AND MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND MY QUESTION IS, AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO PUT EDUCATION BACK IN THE HANDS OF PARENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT? GIVE US MORE CHOICE, AND FREE US FROM COMMON FOR -- COMMON CORE. >> ALL FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS IN COMMON CORE WOULD CEASE AND DESIST. [APPLAUSE] I SUPPORT CURRICULUM REFORM. WE DID IT IN FLORIDA WHEN I WAS A SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. WE IMPROVED THE CURRICULUM AT THE STATE LEVEL. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS DO -- WITH THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM, YOU CAN GO SEE YOUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS, THE PRINCIPAL, YOU CAN GO SEE THE LEGISLATOR. TRY GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, YOU WILL FIND A PERSON TO TALK TO. WE DON'T NEED A NATIONAL SCHOOL BOARD. I DON'T THINK WE NEED A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. [APPLAUSE] I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THAT AS A PARENT. >> I SERVED IN IRAQ, AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF HAVING A DOZEN AND A HALF IRAQI FOREIGN NATIONALS WORKING FOR ME AS TRANSLATORS. THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE FULLY VETTED AND HAD NO PROMISE OF ANY CONSIDERATION FOR GETTING OUT OF THE COUNTRY IF THINGS WENT SOUTH. IN THE NEWS WE SEE HER ABOUT REFUGEES OUT OF SYRIA AND FIGURING OUT WHAT COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO TAKE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF REFUGEES WHO ARE NOT THAT IT. AS PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU SUPPORT POLICIES FOR SOMEONE WHO PUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AT PERSONAL RISK TO SERVE WITHOUT SERVICEMEN GO TO THE BACK OF LINE AND ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THAT IT TO GO TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE? >> WORD GETS AROUND. IT'S UNLIKELY PEOPLE GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT. THEY TELL OTHER PEOPLE, AMERICANS THE TRADE ME FOR THAT AMERICANS TURNED THEIR BACK ON US. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PUTIN IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. THE JENNER THAT HE ARGUED THAT HE IS USING IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS THAT BARACK OBAMA IS AN UNRELIABLE GUIDE. LOOK AT US, TWO WEEKS AND ALREADY CONDUCTING OPERATIONS AND WE ARE MORE RELIABLE THAN AMERICA. HE IS MAKING THAT ARGUMENT TO IRAQ, INJECTIONS, SYRIANS, LET ME SAY THIS. WE ALWAYS ACCEPT REFUGEES IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ACCEPTED THEM FROM VIETNAM AFTER THE FALL OF SOUTH VIETNAM. IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO EXCEPT REFUGEES, IT'S THAT IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THEM, THEY HAVE TO BE VETTED AND NOT EASY TO THAT SOMEONE FROM SYRIA. YOU CAN'T JUST PICK UP THE PHONE. IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT, IT'S THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT. IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO THAT PEOPLE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT REFUGEES BECAUSE OF THAT. THE INSTANCE THAT YOU POINTED OUT, PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED ALONG OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM, IT IS WRONG THAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. [APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE TO SAY, I HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT CLIMATE CONTROL AND NOT FIGHTING IT BECAUSE THE U.S. CAN'T WIN THE BATTLE ALONE. CHINA HAS RECENTLY INTRODUCED A GROUNDBREAKING PROGRAM TO LIMIT CARBON EMISSIONS WITH A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I AM WONDERING, WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO MATCH THEIR COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE? >> THE CHINESE IS SAID THAT IN THE YEAR 2030, ABLE BEGIN TO DO SOME STUFF, WE WILL SEE. THEY CONTINUE TO ADMIT MORE CARBON THAN ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH. THE SECOND POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THE CLIMATE IS ALWAYS CHANGING. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN THE CLIMATE WAS UNCHANGED. THE DEBATE FOR ME IS, WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT? I HAVE PEOPLE COME FORWARD AND SAY THEY WANT ME TO PASS THIS LAW, WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND I ASKED THEM, IF WE PASS THIS LAW, HOW MANY INCHES OF C RISE WILL PREVENT? WELL, IT WILL PREVENT ANYTHING FOR 150 YEARS. SO IT WON'T HAVE A MEASURABLE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, I ASKED ECONOMISTS WHAT IT WILL DO, THEY SAY WILL MAKE LIVING IN AMERICA MORE EXPENSIVE, IT WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BUSINESSES TO SUCCEED IN AMERICA AS OPPOSED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I AM PRESENTED WITH OPTIONS THAT HAVE DEEP ECONOMIC COST, NO ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT, HOW IS THAT A GOOD DEAL FOR THE COUNTRY? AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT DOES NOTHING BUT HURT THE ECONOMY AND NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK THE AMERICAN INNOVATORS WILL HELP SOLVE A LOT OF THIS BY MAKING US MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT. I HAVE NO PROBLEM IN LEAVING THE -- LEADING THE WORLD IN SOLAR, WIND, AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES. WE WILL ALSO LEAD THE WORLD IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS. WE WILL NOT EMASCULATE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY -- ECONOMY AND HOLD US BACK FROM IT -- ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. ESPECIALLY WHEN BILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE STUCK IN LOW-PAYING JOBS. I AM NOT SUPPORTING ANY POLICIES THAT ARE BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY AND DID NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. [APPLAUSE] >> I DON'T DO THIS KIND OF THING AND -- >> IT'S NOT THAT BAD. >> I NOTICED YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, HAVING CHILDREN. YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN A LOT OF US -- WHAT ABOUT OUR GENERATION, THE ONES THAT COUNT NOW, THE ONES WHOSE VOTES OF THE COMING FORWARD. HOW DO WE GET BETTER PAYING JOBS? YOU GOT US WHERE WORKING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, BARELY MAKING IT, WORKING TWO JOBS. WE CAN'T GET AHEAD AND WE DON'T FOLLOW THOSE TAX BREAKS WE DON'T FALL INTO OBAMACARE. OUR GENERATION NOW, WE ARE SUFFERING THE MOST. HOW IS THE PRESIDENT -- WHAT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TO HELP US. >> WE WILL HAVE A PROFAMILY TAX CODE BECAUSE FOR WORKING FAMILIES, IS MORE SPECIAL THAN EVER TO RAISE CHILDREN. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, WE NEED TO CREATE GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO CREATE JOBS FOR YOU TO PAY MORE. THAT IS NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. JOBS THAT PAY MORE ARE NOT BEING CREATED. THEN OBLITERATE IS DOWN TO 5%, THERE ARE THINGS THEY'RE NOT TELLING YOU, THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE NOT EVEN LOOKING FOR WORK ANYMORE AND THE JOBS THAT ARE BEING CREATED DON'T PAY ENOUGH. YOU CAN'T LIVE ON THOSE JOBS. WE NEED TO MAKE AMERICA THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD CREATE JOBS THAT PAY MORE AND WHAT IS HOLDING THEM BACK, I WILL TELL YOU. A LOT OF IT IS GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT MAKE IT HARDER TO HIRE PEOPLE, THAT MAKE IT MORE EXTENSIVE TO HIRE PEOPLE. OBAMACARE MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO HIRE PEOPLE, AND MORE SPENCER TO PAY THE MORE SO THEY DON'T HIRE MORE. REGULATORS, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS, MAKES IT MORE SPENCER TO BE IN BUSINESS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 35 YEARS WE HAVE MORE BUSINESSES DYING THAN STARTING, THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR JOB CREATION. IF I INVEST MONEY IN A SMALL BUSINESS TO GROW IT, I HAVE TO TAKE THAT MONEY BACK IN MY TAXES OVER A LARGE NUMBER OF YEARS AS OPPOSED TO GETTING IT BACK RIGHT AND ONCE. IF WE HAD A TAX CODE THAT SAID THE MORE AND -- THE MORE YOU INVEST THE LESS YOU PAY, KNOWINGLY HIRE MORE PEOPLE, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY THE MORE. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO REFORM THE TAX CODE. WE CAN'T BE GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE BUSINESS TAX RATE ON THE DEVELOPED WORLD. WE HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO SUCCEED AND IN TURN, THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL CREATE MORE JOBS THAT PAY MORE. MY FATHER WAS NOT A BUSINESS OWNER. HE OWNED A SMALL GROCERY STORE FOR A SECOND AND A HALF. HE WAS LARGELY AN EMPLOYEE, HE WORKED AS AN EMPLOYEE AT A HOTEL. THE REASON HE HAD A JOB THAT PAID ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE A WILL TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY WAS SOMEWHAT WET ACCESS TO MONEY RISK THAT MONEY TO BUILD THAT -- RISKED THAT MIGHT TO BUILD THAT HOTEL. WHEN HE TO GET BACK TO A PLACE IN OUR ECONOMY WERE PEOPLE ARE INCENTIVIZED CREATE MORE SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT THAT PAY MORE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE MORE MONEY. WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING ANYTHING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE MORE EXPENSIVE. BY PASSING RIDICULOUS EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT MAKE YOUR ENERGY BILL GO UP WHILE YOUR TAX -- WHERE AT -- WHILE YOUR INCOME IS FLAT. BETTER PAYING JOBS WILL REQUIRE MORE SKILLS THAN PEOPLE HAVE RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW YOUR STORY, BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT IF YOU ARE WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CAN JUST DROP EVERYTHING AND SIT IN A CLASSROOM FOR FOUR YEARS. IF WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER AND CHEAPER FOR YOU TO ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL SKILL THROUGH A COUPLE OF HOURS -- TWO COURSES ONLINE ALLOW YOU TO RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE, SUDDENLY YOU QUALIFY FOR A NEW JOB THAT PAYS MORE, WE HAVE TO MAKE EASIER FOR YOU TO DO THAT AS WELL TO MULL -- MY POLICIES ARE DESIGNED AROUND THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE AMERICA THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO MAKE BETTER PAYING JOBS AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO ACQUIRE THE ADDITIONAL SKILLS YOU NEED TO QUALIFY FOR THOSE BETTER PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU FOR COMING. MY QUESTION IS ON THE CONSTITUTION. ARTICLE FIVE, THERE IS A MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THIS NATION RIGHT NOW TO HAVE AN ARTICLE FIVE CONVENTION. THE YOU APPROVE THAT, DISAPPROVE IT, AND IF SO, WHY? >> IF THAT'S WHAT CITIZENS WANT, WE SHOULD DO IT. MAKE SURE WE KNOW HOW IT WILL TURN OUT BECAUSE IF YOU OPEN UP THE CONSTITUTION, YOU ARE ALSO OPENING UP THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO RE-EXAMINE THE FIRST AMENDMENT, PEOPLE THAT WANT TO RE-EXAMINE THE SECOND AMENDMENT. PEOPLE THAT WANT TO RE-EXAMINE SOME OTHER FUNDAMENTAL PROTECTIONS BUILT WITHIN. ULTIMATELY, THERE IS A PROVISION THAT EXISTS FOR CITIZENS TO AMEND THEIR RESTITUTION AND RE-EXAMINE IT. IF CITIZENS WANT TO DO THAT, I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. THE SAME GROUP TRYING TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT VIOLATES BECAUSE EDITION OF THE SAME GROUPS THAT WILL TRY TO CHANGE THAT VIOLATE -- CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION. [APPLAUSE] >> THAT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO APPOINT ONE, MAYBE TWO MORE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR CRITERIA FOR APPOINTING THEM? >> MY CRITERIA FOR APPOINTING JUSTICES, NOT JUST SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, ARE PEOPLE THAT ADHERE TO THE CONSTITUTION. THEY VIEW THE ROLE OF AN APPELLATE JUDGE TO APPLY THE CONSTITUTION, NOT TO CREATIVELY MANIPULATED. NOT TO SPIN IT TO REACH A POLICY CONCLUSION THAT THEY WANT. WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE WE HAVE JUDGES BASICALLY WHO BELIEVE WE HAVE JUSTICES, AT LEAST FIVE OF THE SUPREME COURT THAT BELIEVE THAT THEIR JOB IS TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO MANIPULATE THE CONSTITUTION TO REACH A POLICY OUTCOME THAT THEY PERSONALLY FAVOR. THAT IS NOT THE JOB OF THE JUSTICES. THE JOB OF OUR JUSTICES IS TO APPLY THE CONSTITUTION AS QUICKLY CONSTRUCTED BY THE FOUNDERS AND THE AMENDMENTS OF FOLLOWED. THE JOB OF THE APPELLATE COURT IS TO APPLY THE CONSTITUTION, NOT TOO EXPANDED OR MANIPULATED. MY NUMBER ONE CRITERIA WILL BE THIS, ARE YOU A STRAIGHT CONSTRUCTIONIST? DO YOU BELIEVE THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN SHOULD BE LIVED BY AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THAT IS THROUGH CONVENTION OR AMENDED PROCESS, NOT A CREATIVE JUDICIAL DECISION THAT SPANS THE REACH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT DOCUMENT IS A DOCUMENT OF LIMITATION. THE CONSTITUTION IS A DOCUMENT THAT LIMITS THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT. IT BASICALLY SAYS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD, THESE ARE THE ONLY POWERS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS. IF THERE ARE NOT OUTLINED HERE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THESE TOWERS, THEY BELONG TO THE STATE, LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TO PEOPLE AND WE JUSTICES THAT UNDERSTAND THAT MORE THAN EVER. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WOULD STAY LONGER, THE ONLY REASON I AM TO CUT IT SHORT IS BECAUSE I HAVE TO CATCH AIRPLANE. THEY DON'T WAIT FOR ME. THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE WILL BE BACK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE ENJOYED THIS TREMENDOUSLY AND I WILL STAY AROUND FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES SAY HELLO TO YOU IN PERSON AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ALL AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] [GREETING AND THANKS] >> SENATOR MARCO RUBIO RUN -- ROUNDING UP A -- WRAPPING UP A TIME OF MEETING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU CAN",2015-11-07 18:03:06,2015-10-14,Derry,New Hampshire
http://www.c-span.org/video/?328637-1/hillary-clinton-campaign-rally-las-vegas,Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally in Las Vegas,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"BE ABLE TO SEE ALL OF IT LATER ON OUR C-SPAN SCHEDULE AND TAKE YOU LIVE, AS PROMISED, TO LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. HILLARY CLINTON JUST TAKING THE STAGE FOR A CAMPAIGN RALLY. LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. SECRETARY CLINTON: IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU. DID WE HAVE A GOOD DEBATE LAST NIGHT! AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS IT WAS GOOD IS BECAUSE WE WERE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE DOING TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT YOU NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR LIVES, AND I AM THRILLED THAT PEOPLE FINALLY GOT A CHANCE TO COMPARE THE DEMOCRATS TO THE REPUBLICANS AND I THINK WE CAME OUT OF THAT PRETTY WELL. I AM THRILLED TO SEE ALL OF YOU HERE IN THIS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL SPOT. IT IS SUCH A GREAT PLEASURE TO LOOK OUT AND SEE SO MANY OF YOU WHO ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAUCUS IN THE NEVADA CAUCUSES AND THEN WE WILL WIN NEVADA FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO KEEP A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE! NOW, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST KIND OF GET RID OF SOME OF THE MYTHS THAT YOU HEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE. STARTING WITH A FACT THAT OUR ECONOMY IN OUR COUNTRY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST TO PUT THOSE FACTS IN YOUR HEAD SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING WITH SOME OF YOUR OPEN-MINDED INDEPENDENT FRIENDS OR YOU'RE TALKING TO REPUBLICANS, YOU CAN TELL THEM THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ME SAYING IT. THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE. WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER, INCOME IS HIGHER, AND EVEN THE STOCK MARKET IS HIGHER, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A RECESSION. I KNOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SAY THEY WANT TO GO BACK AND DO WHAT DIDN'T WORK BEFORE. I THINK THEY WANT US ALL TO FORGET ABOUT THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH HIT THIS STATE REALLY HARD. YOU KNOW, IN 2008, WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. WE ENDED UP LOSING NINE MILLION JOBS. NINE MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY LOST THEIR JOBS. FIVE MILLION LOST THEIR HOMES. AFTER THAT ELECTION, JUST ABOUT A WEEK AFTER IT, I GOT A CALL FROM THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA AND HE ASKED ME TO COME SEE HIM IN CHICAGO AND I KNOW WHY. TURNS OUT HE WANTED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE WHICH I WAS VERY HONORED TO BE ASKED TO DO. BUT WHEN I GOT THERE, HE SAID, WE COULD FALL INTO A GREAT DEPRESSION. AND WE COULD HAVE. I DO NOT THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR SAVING OUR ECONOMY FROM WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN EVEN WORSE CRISIS, SAVING THE AUTO INDUSTRY, CRACKING DOWN ON WALL STREET ABUSES WHICH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN IGNORING, AND PASSING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH NOW PROVIDES HEALTH INSURANCE TO 18 MILLION AMERICANS! SO YOU WOULD THINK WITH A RECORD LIKE THAT, THE REPUBLICANS MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THEIR APPROACH, BUT NOT A BIT. IN FACT, YOU HEAR ONLY THE SAME THINGS THAT ENDED UP IN THE DITCH IN THE FIRST PLACE. CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, GET OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. THAT'S BASICALLY ALL THEY SAY ABOUT THE ECONOMY. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK, FOLKS. I HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. I'M PRETTY PROUD OF THE ECONOMIC RECORD MY HUSBAND HAD AT THE END OF EIGHT YEARS OF HIS PRESIDENCY WE HAD 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. AND LISTEN TO THIS, INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY. NOT JUST FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, WORKING FOLKS, POOR PEOPLE -- EVERYBODY BENEFITED, BECAUSE WE HAD AN ECONOMY THAT WAS WORKING FOR EVERYBODY AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT ALL CHANGED WHEN THE REPUBLICANS CAME BACK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. AND SO PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TO DIG US OUT OF THE DITCH. WE'RE OUT, WE'RE STANDING BUT WE'RE NOT YET RUNNING. I WANT TO DO WHAT WILL WORK TO PUT MORE PEOPLE TO WORK AND TO RAISE WAGES AGAIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BUDGED. THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WHEN C.E.O. PAY IS 300 TIMES WHAT THE TYPICAL WORKER MAKES. NOW, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY BELIEVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET WAGES RISING AGAIN UNLESS WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT WITH A PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT MAKING SURE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE SEE THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR. SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO START BY CREATING MORE JOBS, BY ACTUALLY INVESTING IN PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK TO BUILD, MAINTAIN OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR AIRPORTS. WE'RE GOING TO REPAIR OUR SEWER LINES, OUR WATER LINE, OUR GAS LINES. WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND BROAD BAND SO THAT WE HAVE THE CHEAPEST, FASTEST BROADBAND IN THE WORLD INSTEAD OF RANKING BEHIND SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH WHICH WILL RESULT IN A LOT OF NEW BUSINESSES. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON ANYTHING THAT ACTUALLY HELPS PEOPLE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE. WELL, WE INVESTED $3.8 BILLION IN SOMETHING CALLED THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT 20 YEARS AGO. I REMEMBER BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE THE DAY THAT MY HUSBAND ANNOUNCED IT HAD BEEN COMPLETED. NOW, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CURE DISEASES AND MAYBE STOP CONDITIONS ONCE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES THEM. BUT HERE'S THE ECONOMIC POINT I WANT TO MAKE. OUT OF THAT $3.8 BILLION INVESTMENT OF YOUR TAX MONEY AND MINE, NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN GENERATED -- NEW DISCOVERIES, NEW BUSINESSES, NEW KINDS OF JOBS FOR THE FUTURE. WE'RE BETTER AT THIS THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. WE NEED TO BE MAKING THOSE SMART INVESTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE US RICHER AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THE CONGRESS TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND BEGIN TO BUILD A BETTER ECONOMIC FUTURE AGAIN! I TELL YOU ANOTHER WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE ECONOMY, CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES AND THAT IS WE TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY, DON'T WE? WE'RE NOT OVER WITH THOSE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO EVERY TIME YOU ASK THEM, WELL, WHAT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE? THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE, WELL, I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. WELL, THERE'S A VERY EASY WAY TO SOLVE THAT. TALK TO A SCIENTIST, WHY DON'T YOU? THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY. THEY COULD TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO AFFECT THE LIVES OF EVERYONE OF US ALIVE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. BUT BECAUSE IF WE DO THIS RIGHT, WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW, EVERY YEAR, SENATOR HARRY REID HAS A BIG CONFERENCE ABOUT CLEAN ENERGY HERE IN NEVADA. I'VE SPOKEN AT IT. MY HUSBAND'S SPOKEN AT IT. WHY DOES HE DO THAT? BECAUSE HE WANTS PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. YOU KNOW, IT IS POSSIBLE, IF WE INVEST IN WIND AND SOLAR, ADVANCED BIOFUELS, GEOTHERMAL, YOU NAME IT, WE COULD NOT ONLY BEGIN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT WE COULD BEGIN TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAY. YOU HERE IN NEVADA ARE DOING JUST THAT, YOU'VE GOT THAT BIG BATTERY FACTORY GOING IN. YOU'VE BEEN INVESTING IN MORE SOLAR. IN THE HOTEL I STAYED IN BEFORE THE DEBATE, I WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND I SAW THOSE SOLAR PANELS DRIVING AROUND TODAY, GOING TO DIFFERENT EVENTS, I SAW A LOT OF PLACES WITH SOLAR PANELS. WELL, I'M SETTING SOME BIG GOALS FOR MY PRESIDENCY. BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, I WANT US TO HAVE EMPLOYED A HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS TO BE INSTALLED ACROSS AMERICA AND BY THE END OF MY SECOND, I WANT US TO GENERATE ENOUGH CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA. THAT IS THE KIND OF ECONOMIC PROGRAM THAT WILL PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. THE WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS YOU THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT JOBS GOING OVERSEAS, WELL, IF WE DO INFRASTRUCTURE AT HOME, AND WE DO CLEAN ENERGY AT HOME, THOSE JOBS HAVE TO BE DONE RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOW, I ALSO BELIEVE WE GOT TO CHANGE THE TAX SYSTEM. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF CORPORATIONS GETTING BIG TAX BREAKS AND LOOPHOLES AND ALL THE REST OF IT TO SHIP JOBS OUT OF AMERICA. WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY THE TAX BREAKS FROM THOSE CORPORATIONS AND USE THAT MONEY TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY RIGHT HERE AT HOME. WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO RAISE WAGES STARTING BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH HAS BEEN TOO LOW FOR TOO LONG. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE WHO WORK FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE HERE. RIGHT? I KNOW THAT. THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE, $7.25 AN HOUR, IS A DISGRACE. NOBODY WHO WORKS FULL-TIME SHOULD BE LEFT IN POVERTY AT THE END OF THEIR WORKING WEEK. SO WE ARE GOING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT HAS EVER BEEN, BACK TO WHERE IT WAS IN 1968, BECAUSE SINCE THEN, WE HAVE BEEN ON A DOWNWARD SLOPE. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO DO MORE TO INVEST IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS, IN JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS. I WAS AT THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES TODAY LOOKING AT HOW THEY TRAIN THEIR YOUNG APPRENTICES. I WAS SO IMPRESSED. I KNOW WE CAN TRAIN TENS OF THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO DO THE JOBS THAT CLEAN ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING REQUIRE. NOW, I'LL TELL YOU, THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THAT WILL RAISE WAGES ACROSS THE BOARD IN AMERICA AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS IN 2015. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN DONE YET. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF IT. I MET A YOUNG MAN LAST WEEK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO CAME UP TO ME AND HE SAID, I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I'M FOR YOU. I SAID, THANK YOU, WHY? HE SAID, I'LL TELL YOU. MY FIRST JOB, HE WAS 17 YEARS OLD, HE TOLD ME, HE GOT HIRED TO BE A CASHIER IN A STORE NEAR WHERE HE LIVED. HE KIND OF GOT THE JOB BECAUSE HIS MOM HAD BEEN WORKING THERE FOR FOUR YEARS AND SHE WAS DOING THE SAME JOB AS A CASHIER. HE WAS REALLY PROUD. YOU KNOW, FIRST REAL JOB, YOU GO TO WORK, AND HE CAME BACK, GOT HIS FIRST PAYCHECK, SHOWED HIS MOM. AND SHE NOTICED SOMETHING. HER SON WAS MAKING A DOLLAR MORE AN HOUR AFTER ONE WEEK THAN SHE WAS MAKING AFTER FOUR YEARS. NOW, I TELL YOU THAT STORY BECAUSE THIS YOUNG MAN HAD NO REASON TO MAKE IT UP. HE WANTED TO TELL ME WHY HE WAS FOR ME. HE SAID, I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE. HE SAID, IT'S WRONG. MY MOM WORKS REALLY HARD. SHE WAS RAISING ME AND SHE SHOULD BE PAID AT THE SAME LEVEL AS ANY MAN, INCLUDING HER 17-YEAR-OLD SON. EQUAL PAY IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A WOMAN'S ISSUE. IT'S A FAMILY ISSUE. IT'S AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. THERE WILL BE MORE MONEY IN THE ECONOMY WHEN WOMEN ARE PAID FAIRLY FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW HARD IT IS TO BALANCE FAMILY AND WORK. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF YOUNG PARENTS STRUGGLE WITH THAT, DON'T YOU? I THINK WE SHOULD JOIN THE REST OF THE ADVANCED WORLD AND HAVE PAID LEAVE SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A NEW BABY, WHEN YOU HAVE A SICK RELATIVE, YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR JOB BUT YOU ALSO DON'T LOSE YOUR PAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, YOU'RE ABLE TO FULFILL YOUR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. SOME PEOPLE SAY, WELL, WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT, BUT CALIFORNIA'S BEEN DOING THIS. CONNECTICUT JUST DID PAID SICK DAYS. OTHER STATES ARE DOING IT. AND IT HASN'T AFFECTED THE WAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS SAY IT WILL FOR EMPLOYMENT. SO WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A HARD LOOK ABOUT WHAT ARE FAMILIES LIKE TODAY, NOT WHAT THEY WERE LIKE 50 YEARS, WHAT ARE THEY LIKE TODAY. AND HOW DO WE HELP THEM DO THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB WHICH IS TAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER WHILE THEY ALSO DO THEIR JOB MAKING A LIVING. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE TAX SYSTEM BE CHANGED SO THAT THE WEALTHY PAY MORE THAN THEY'RE PAYING RIGHT NOW. I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT A MILLIONAIRE CAN PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN A TEACHER. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I AGREE WITH WARREN BUFFETT. WARREN BUFFETT SAID, EVERY MILLIONAIRE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST 30%, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT PAYING 15, AND A LOT OF COMPANIES AREN'T PAYING ANYTHING. SO PART OF THE JOB THAT I WILL TAKE ON AS YOUR PRESIDENT IS TO GET THE WEALTHY TO PAY MORE AND GIVE THE MIDDLE CLASS A TAX CUT. GIVE THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT IS WORKING HARD AND DOING THE BEST YOU CAN IN THE FACE OF THE PRESSURES YOU FACE, MORE OF A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. SINCE YOUR PAY HASN'T GONE UP BUT THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING ELSE HAS, I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THE REPUBLICANS SEEM TOTHE REPUBLICANS SEEM TO FORGET THAT WHAT MAKES OUR ECONOMY GREAT AND THE MIDDLE CLASS STRONG AS THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES MOST OF THE WORK. IT'S THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT HAS TO GET UP EVERY DAY AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR JOB. AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE START REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS, GIVING YOU THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR OWN LIVES, AT HOME AND AT WORK. AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE WOULD REALLY HELP US IN THE ECONOMY, AND THAT IS TO GET COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM FINALLY TAKEN CARE OF. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: I REALLY DON'T LIKE WITH REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS. WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. WE WERE BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS. EVERY ONE OF US, GRANDPARENTS, GREAT-GRANDPARENTS, WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. AND AREN'T WE GLAD THEY DID. AND AREN'T WE RELIEVED THAT WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THEIR HARD WORK. MY GRANDFATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS JUST A LITTLE BOY. HE WAS A FACTORY WORKER. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE DID NOT ASK FOR MUCH. HE MADE A GOOD LIVING, BY THOSE STANDARDS IN THOSE DAYS, BY HIS HARD WORK, BUT HE WANTED HIS KIDS TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE. AND ALL THREE OF HIS SONS WENT TO COLLEGE. AND MY DAD BECAME A MEMBER OF THE MILITARY IN WORLD WAR II. AND NOW I'M HERE ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR ME FOR PRESIDENT. THAT IS THREE GENERATIONS, FROM MY GRANDFATHER TO MY FATHER TO ME. AND IF WE HAVE TIME TONIGHT, WE COULD GO THROUGH THIS CROWD AND HAVE A THOUSAND STORIES LIKE THAT. IMMIGRATION IS WHO WE ARE. LOOK AROUND US. AND I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING GREAT DAMAGE TO OUR NATION BY THEIR INSULTS AND ATTACKS ON IMMIGRANTS. SO AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL CERTAINLY WORK HARD FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM , BUT I WILL ALSO DEFEND THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSUED ON BEHALF OF DREAMERS. AND I KNOW -- I KNOW WE HAVE SOME DREAMERS HERE TONIGHT. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO WORK HARD IN AMERICA AND I WANT YOU TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO BUILDING OUR ECONOMY. AND THERE ARE SO MANY EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT, THOUGH, THAT WE GIVE THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION TO EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY, SO THAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO BE COMPETITIVE. I WILL DO WHAT I CAN, WORKING WITH THE TEACHERS OF AMERICA AND RESPECTING THE TEACHERS OF AMERICA TO DO WHAT WILL WORK IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION, TO GIVE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE THE BEST POSSIBLE START IN LIFE. BUT I WILL TO YOU THIS -- IF WE DO NOT DO SOMETHING WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, IF WE DON'T HELP KIDS COME ESPECIALLY KIDS WHO FIRST LINK WHICH -- WHOSE FIRST LINK WHICH MAY NOT BE LIKE WHICH, IF WE DO NOT GET YOU PREPARED FOR SCHOOL, YOU WILL NOT GO AS FAR AS YOU COULD. SO THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THOSE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. THE FAMILIES ARE THE FIRST SCHOOL, THE PARENTS ARE THE FIRST TEACHERS, AND WE NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP YOU PREPARE YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. SO I WANT TO HAVE UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN THAT WILL GIVE EVERY CHILD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PREPARED. AND THEN ON THE OTHER END, I WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE SO IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO TO COLLEGE, YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO AND GRADUATE. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: HOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS CROWD HAVE STUDENT LOANS? HOW MANY HAVE EVER HAD STUDENT LOANS? I HAD STUDENT LOANS. I HAD TO PAY THEM BACK. MY HUSBAND HAD THEM COME HE PAY THEM BACK. BUT IT IS NOT LIKE IT IS TODAY, WHERE IT COST SO MUCH AND THE INTEREST RATES ARE SO HIGH. WE HAVE 40 MILLION AMERICANS WITH STUDENT LOANS. I WANT YOU TO BE A BUT TO REFINANCE THOSE LOANS TO A LOWER INTEREST RATE -- I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THOSE LOANS TO A LOWER INTEREST RATE AND SAVE THOUSANDS. IF A CORPORATION CAN REFINANCE ITS DEBT, A YOUNG PERSON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR DEBT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. I WANT TO OFFER FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND -- [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: DEBT FREE TUITION AT ANY PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. SO THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO GO. BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS -- IF YOU ARE WELL OFF, EVEN IF YOUR GRADES WERE NOT THAT GREAT, YOU WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATE. BUT IF YOU ARE MIDDLE-CLASS OR WORKING OR POOR, BUT JUST AS AMBITIOUS, JUST AS WILLING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES, YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO START OR YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FINISH. I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN SO THAT ANY YOUNG PERSON IN AMERICA CAN GET THE JOB TRAINING YOU WANT, AND APPRENTICESHIP IF YOU WANT, COMMUNITY COLLEGE IF YOU WANT IT, FOR YOUR COLLEGE IF YOU WANT IT AT A PRICE THAT YOU CAN PAY, AND THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PAY AT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME THAT YOU ARE. -- THAT YOU EARN. AND IF YOU DO PUBLIC SERVICE WORK LIKE TEACHING OR POLICING OR FIREFIGHTING, YOU WILL PAY A LOWER RATE TO BE ABOUT TO GO AND GET YOUR EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] I ALSO WANT TO SAY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED 54 TIMES TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 54 TIMES. IF THEY GET A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, THEY WILL SUCCEED. THAT IS UP TO YOU. I WILL DO MY PART, BUT I'M GOING TO NEED HN EVERYONE OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS -- I'M GOING TO NEED EACH AND EVERYONE ONE OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: I WILL DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 18 MILLION PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING THEIR HEALTH CARE THROUGH IT. BUT I DO WANT TO MIX SOME CHANGES THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. I WANT TO CUT COSTS OF YOUR OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. I WANT TO CUT THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE SKYROCKETING BEYOND THE AFFORDABILITY OF AMERICANS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS GET TAKEN CARE OF, JUST LIKE PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ARE A CAREGIVER FOR SOMEBODY WITH ALZHEIMER'S OR AUTISM OR ANY OTHER SITUATION LIKE THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OR FAMILY CAREGIVER THAT YOU HAVE SOME HELP. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES, AND WE HAVE MILLIONS MORE WHO ARE WORKING BARELY FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. WE CANNOT DO THAT. WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE PLAN FOR CAREGIVING AS WE ALL FACE THE ONSLAUGHT OF ALL TIMERS -- ALZHEIMER'S. OR WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH AUTISM GET OLDER. WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THAT. AND THEY'RE SOMETHING ELSE WE NEED TO TREAT RIGHT NOW, AND THAT HIS ADDICTION. 23 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS. ALCOHOL OR DRUGS. AND THEY CANNOT GET HELP EVEN IF THEY WANT IT. ONLY ONE IN 10 CAN GET IT. WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE HELP AND MORE SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE ADDICTED. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ENDING UP IN JAIL OR ENDING UP ON THE STREETS, AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT, AND WE END UP SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN WE WOULD. I WILL TELL YOU, I SPEND A LOT OF TIMES AND I WOULD THESE DAYS. IOWA HAS GOOD DRUG SUPPORT. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING GOOD WORK HELPING FOLKS. BUT THEY RAN OUT OF MONEY, SO THEY ARE SETTING AT THEM. LET ME TELL YOU THIS LITTLE FACT -- IT COSTS $3500 FOR SOMEBODY TO GO THROUGH DRUG COURT, TO TRY TO GET THEM OFF DRUGS, GET TREATMENT. IF THEY GO TO PRISON, IT COSTS $35,000. ECONOMICALLY, IT MAKES NO SENSE. IF WE TREAT PEOPLE, IT WILL SAVE US MONEY AND SAVE LIVES AND HELP THEM GET BETTER AND OVERCOME THEIR PROBLEMS. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: NOW, THERE IS A LOT THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA TODAY. AND I WILL. I WILL FIGHT TO DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, AND I WILL FIGHT -- [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: I WILL FIGHT AGAINST EFFORTS TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, WHICH HAS PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: I WILL FIGHT TO ENFORCE MARRIAGE EQUALITY, AND THEN FIGHT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT HUM COMMUNITY. I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU TURN 18 YOU CAN VOTE AND YOU WILL NOT BE STOPPED BY LAWS TRYING TO RESTRICT THE VOTE AND AMERICA. AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO OVERTURN A DECISION CALLED CITIZENS UNITED, WHICH HAS CORRUPTED OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. I WILL ALSO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VETERANS GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE, NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE BLACK LIVES MATTER BY REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: AND I WILL TRY TO FIND WAYS SO THAT WE AS AMERICANS CAN START LISTENING TO EACH OTHER AGAIN. TALKING WITH EACH OTHER. I'M TIRED OF THE YELLING AND THE INSULTS AND THE ATTACKS AND THE SNIDE REMARKS ABOUT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTAGE OR RELIGION OR WHO THEY LOVE OR WHAT THEY DO. I'M TIRED OF IT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHO WE ARE. WE CAN HAVE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. WE DO HAVE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. BUT WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TREATING REACH OTHER -- TREATING EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT. AND THAT CANNOT HAPPEN IF YOU ARE BEING YELLED AT. OR IF YOU ARE BEING INSULTED. I FEEL THAT WE ARE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW IN OUR POLITICS. WE ARE NOT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND THE WAY THAT WE NEED TO. BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG GROUP THAT DON'T WANT TO TRY. THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ON THIS EARTH HAS ALL THE ANSWERS. I THINK WE SHOULD BE LISTENING AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY, WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET HEALTH CARE AND WE FAILED. AND I SAID, OK, WE FAILED. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW? I GOT TO WORK TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WOULD INSURE CHILDREN. I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. AND WE ENDED UP STARTING THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH TAKES CARE AND PROVIDES HEALTH CARE TO 8 MILLION CHILDREN IN AMERICA TODAY. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: AND WHEN I WENT TO THE SENATE, I LEARNED THAT OUR NATIONAL GUARD MEN AND WOMEN WERE NOT GETTING HEALTH CARE EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE DEPLOYED. I DID NOT THINK THAT WAS RIGHT. I TEAMED UP WITH THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR, LINDSEY GRAHAM, WHO WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE OTHER SIDE. NO, LISTEN, WE WORK TOGETHER. THAT'S MY POINT. WE MAY NOT WORK ON ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT ONE ISSUE, BUT IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. WE PASSED A BILL TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TO OUR NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND NATIONAL GUARD'S WOMEN SO THEY COULD BE HEALTHY AND THEIR FAMILIES COULD BE HEALTHY. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: AND WHEN I WAS SECRETARY, I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS. WE NEGOTIATE A DEAL TO CUT THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA. AND I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS TO PASS IT. WE HAD TO GET 67 VOTES. IT WAS AN IMPORTANT TREATY. BUT WE TALKED TO EACH OTHER. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TRIED SO HARD TO FIND COMMON GROUND. AND HE HAS REACHED OUT AND HE HAS INVITED PEOPLE, AND THEY JUST GET FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY, AND THEIR ATTITUDE BASICALLY HAS BECOME -- THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE THE RUN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. -- THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE THE RUN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. BECAUSE IN THE VIEW OF SOME HE IS NOT 100 PERCENT WITH THEM. I'M NOT 100% WITH ANYBODY. MY HUSBAND UNDERSTANDS THAT. [APPLAUSE] MS. CLINTON: BUT OUR COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON PEOPLE TALKING AND THEN FINDING COMMON AREAS OF AGREEMENT. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO DOING AGAIN. I WILL GO ANYWHERE, ANYTIME TO TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT FINDING COMMON GROUND, BUT I WILL ALSO STAND MY GROUND. BECAUSE I THINK MY JOB AS YOUR PRESIDENT WILL BE TO RAISE INCOME FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, TO PUT IN PLACE THE LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY SO EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL, AND OF COURSE I'M FEELING THAT PARTICULARLY THEY STRONGLY THESE DAYS BECAUSE I'M A GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS ONE-YEAR-OLD. AND BILL AND I ARE TYPICAL GRANDPARENTS. DON'T GET US STARTED. [LAUGHTER] MS. CLINTON: WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME JUST LOOKING AT HER. WHICH IS, FOR US, INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL. AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE SHE HAS WHATEVER OPPORTUNITIES SHE CAN HAVE IN HER LIFE. I THINK EVERY FAMILY TRIES TO DO THAT. FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. WE HAVE A LOT MORE BLESSINGS. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT WE DO WHAT WE CAN FOR CHARLOTTE, BECAUSE IT MATTERS WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY SHE BECOMES AN ADULT IN AND WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL BE WAITING OUT THERE FOR HER. WILL IT HE SAFE, WILL IT BE PROSPEROUS, WITH A BE PEACEFUL? WILL AMERICA STILL BE THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY, WHERE IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME AND HARD WORK IS REWARDED AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD? IS THAT GOING TO BE THERE? I TELL YOU, I'M BETTING IT WILL, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BY JUST BETTING. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. I TOLD YOU MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER. AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT. SO FOR ME, IT'S NOT ENOUGH THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT GETS AHEAD. I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF FACTORY WORKERS AND GRANDSONS OF TRUCK DRIVERS AND THE GRANDCHILDREN OF TEACHERS AND FAST FOOD WORKERS AND CHILDCARE WORKERS AND EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HARD IN THIS COUNTRY HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL! THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT! THAT'S WHY I NEED YOUR HELP! JOIN US, SAID CAUCUS IN NEVADA, AND LET'S GO WIN NOVEMBER 2016! THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!

http://www.c-span.org/video/?328745-1/john-kasich-remarks-nashua-new-hampshire,"John Kasich Remarks in Nashua, New Hampshire",John R. Kasich,"ANNOUNCER: JOHN KASICH UNVEILED HIS PLAN TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET IN EIGHT YEARS AND OUTLINED HIS AGENDA FOR HIS FIRST HUNDRED DAYS IN OFFICE IF ELECTED. HE SPOKE AT NATIONAL-- NASHUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. >> IT IS MY HONOR TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO THIS EVENT. IT IS EXCITING FOR ME FOR MANY REASONS. I AM A BUCKEYE, AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST BAND IN THE LAND AT OHIO STATE. THIS IS NOT A NEW PLACE FOR GOVERNOR KASICH. HE HAS BEEN HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES, SO THIS IS LIKE OLD HOME WEEK FOR US TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR BACK. WE ARE PLEASED TO HAPPEN HERE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR STUDENTS, OUR CHANCELLOR WHO IS ALSO A RENOWNED ECONOMIST NATIONALLY, AND AS WELL IN THE AUDIENCE IS OUR CHAIR, PAUL HOLLOWAY. I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL HERE, AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE GOVERNOR. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: I HAVE DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE THE TIME TO FIX AMERICA IS NOW. NOT TOMORROW, BUT RIGHT NOW. THE TIME TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AND GET RESULTS EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT POPULAR. SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS EVEN IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT, BECAUSE IF WE CONTINUE TO HESITATE, AMERICA WILL PAY A HIGH PRICE. WE HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH ECONOMIC STAGNATION, BICKERING IN WASHINGTON, PARALYSIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AS THE WORLD BECOMES MORE DANGEROUS. AND NOTHING IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO TURN THINGS AROUND. AND THIS IS ABOUT YOUR COUNTRY, THIS IS ABOUT YOUR FUTURE. WE SEEM SOMETIMES TO BE HANGING IN SPACE. WE ARE NOT GOING FORWARD, BACKWARD, WE ARE WAITING FOR THE NEXT BAD THING TO HAPPEN. IN MY LIFETIME, I CANNOT REMEMBER A TIME WHEN OUR NATION WAITS FOR BAD THINGS TO HAPPEN TO US. WE NEED TO TAKE CONTROL OF OUR FUTURE, AND WE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT NOW. THAT IS WHY I AM LAYING OUT A STRATEGY TODAY THAT WILL HELP US PRODUCE THE RESULTS WE NEED. FOLKS, ALL THE POLITICS, ALL THE FOCUS GROUPS, POLLS, TV RATINGS NEED TO GO OUT THE WINDOW. AND WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER -- [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO DO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY -- LEAD. SOMETIMES IT'S LONELY. LEAD. NO POPULARITY POLLS, JUST GET THE JOB DONE. AND IT STARTS WITH THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE CAN DO, WHICH IS TO GROW AMERICAN PROSPERITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY. CREATING THE CLIMATE FOR JOB GROWTH IS ONE OF OUR GREATEST MORAL PURPOSES. WHEN WE HAVE JOBS, WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES. WE CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE LIFE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE CAN REACH OUR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL TO LIVE A LIFE THAT WE WERE MADE TO LIVE. A STRONG ECONOMY ALSO MAKES POSSIBLE THE MILITARY. THAT IS WHAT KEEPS US SAFE AND SECURE. IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND IT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER WHEN TIMES ARE PARTICULARLY TOUGH. LET ME BE CLEAR, THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CREATE JOBS. AMERICANS DO. WE DO IT BY OUR CREATIVITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: BY OUR RISK-TAKING AND BY OUR HARD WORK. THEREFOR, THE FIRST THING THAT WASHINGTON MUST DO IS GET OUT OF THE WAY, BECAUSE WHEN GOVERNMENT STEPS BACK, WE CAN STEP FORWARD AND AFTER ALL, ISN'T THIS COUNTRY ABOUT ALL OF US? NOT THE BIG SHOTS IN WASHINGTON, IT IS ABOUT US, IN OUR COMMUNITIES, FAMILIES. GOVERNMENT, I HAVE BELIEVED, SHOULD BE THE LAST RESORT, NEVER THE FIRST. WHEN GOVERNMENT IS THE FIRST RESORT, IT OVERSTEPS ITS BOUNDS. WITH TAXES THAT ARE TOO HIGH, SPENDING WE CANNOT AFFORD, AND RED TAPE THAT KILLS JOBS. WE SHOULDN'T LET WASHINGTON DO THINGS THAT WE CAN DO BETTER FOR OURSELVES RIGHT BACK HERE AT HOME. THOSE FOLKS WAY FAR AWAY CANNOT RUN OUR LIVES, WE HAVE TO RUN OUR LIVES. AMERICA IS A LARGE AND DYNAMIC PLACE. GETTING IT GROWING AGAIN IS NOT ABOUT CHECKING OFF A FEW BOXES WITH THESE FOCUS GROUP POLICY PROPOSALS THAT ARE DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY, WE HAVE SEEN THEM, NOR JUST ABOUT BEING A GOOD ADMINISTRATOR. IT IS ABOUT HAVING A VISION AND AN UNDERLYING CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY FOR GETTING AMERICA TO WORK. THEN YOU NEED TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THEN YOU MUST HAVE THE STRENGTH TO GET RESULTS. TALK IS CHEAP. STANDING ON A CORNER AND YELLING AND SCREAMING IS LIKE A CLANGING BELL. IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING. IN MY LIFE I HAVE DONE THINGS THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. I LED THE EFFORT TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GENERATION. IT WASN'T EASY. YOU STEP ON A LOT OF TOES WHEN YOU SHAKE THINGS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. MANY PEOPLE OPPOSED IT, A LOT OF FIGHTING. BUT WE DID IT. IT PRODUCED RESULTS. BUT WASHINGTON TOOK ITS EYE OFF THE BALL. WHEN I LEFT WITH MY FRIENDS, WHO STOOD IN THE BREACH AND BALANCED THE BUDGET, WHEN WE LEFT, WASHINGTON TOOK ITS EYE OFF THE BALL, AND OUR COUNTRY SUFFERED. IN OHIO, MY BELOVED OHIO, WE ARE GETTING RESULTS. WITH MY LEADERSHIP, WE TURNED AND $8 BILLION BUDGET SHORTFALL INTO A $2 BILLION SURPLUS. WE CUT TAXES BY $5 BILLION. THE MOST OF ANY SITTING GOVERNOR IN AMERICA TODAY. WE HELPED OHIOANS CREATE MORE THAN 300,000 JOBS. 300,000 PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: THESE ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS. THEY ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND PEOPLE'S FAMILIES. STRONG LEADERS KEEP THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE AT THE CENTER OF ALL THEY DO, BECAUSE LEADERSHIP IS NOT ABOUT SELF, IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT SERVICE. EVERY AMERICAN, EVERYWHERE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY IS IN MY MIND'S EYE TODAY, ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH IN MCKEE'S ROCKS, WHERE IF THE WIND BLEW THE WRONG WAY, THEY FOUND THEMSELVES OUT OF WORK. THEY PLAYED BY THE RULES, THEY TOOK CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THEY ARE IN MY MIND'S EYE. TODAY I LAY OUT MY VISION FOR LIFTING OUR NATION BY RECLAIMING OUR POWER, BY RECLAIMING OUR MONEY, AND BY RECLAIMING OUR INFLUENCE FROM WASHINGTON. THE FIRST THING THAT WE MUST DO TO GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF OUR WAY IS TO START WITH A BUDGET. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL IMMEDIATELY PUT US ON A PATH TO A BALANCED BUDGET AND I WILL GET IT DONE WITHIN EIGHT YEARS. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: I WENT TO A MEETING THE OTHER DAY WHERE THEY SAID WE CAN DO IT BY 2030. TOO LONG, TOO MUCH DEBT. WITHIN THE FIRST HUNDRED DAYS WE WILL HAVE THAT PLAN TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN EIGHT YEARS, AND TO KEEP IT BALANCED, I WILL START THE PROCESS TO AMEND OUR CONSTITUTION TO REQUIRE WASHINGTON TO BALANCE ITS BUDGET EVERY SINGLE YEAR LIKE STATES AND LIKE FAMILIES IN AMERICA. WE NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO FORCE THEM TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGET AND DO ITS JOB. AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT ME IN THAT. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: A BALANCED BUDGET HELPS CREATE JOBS BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE ROOM IN THE ECONOMY FOR BUSINESSES TO THRIVE AND TO CREATE JOBS. RIGHT OVER HERE, YOU CAN SEE THE FEDERAL DEBT CLOCK. $18 TRILLION-PLUS. IT'S PRETTY AMAZING, ISN'T IT? THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE RUN UP, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO PAY. TO THE STUDENTS HERE TODAY, THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU. IT MEANS $57,000 IN DEBT THAT EACH ONE OF YOU -- $57,000 IN DEBT THAT EACH ONE OF YOU HAVE TO CARRY. AND THAT INCLUDES MY TWO 15-YEAR-OLD TWIN DAUGHTERS. PUTTING DOWN THEIR BACK. WE HAVE TO STOP IT. THINK WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH THIS MONEY TO HELP YOURSELF WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY THAT DEBT IF WE COULD BEGIN TO ERASE IT. I SERVED IN CONGRESS AND BY THE -- AND LED THE COMMITTEE THAT WROTE THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET. I WAS THE CHIEF ARCHITECT OF THE FIRST BALANCED BUDGET. WHEN WE BALANCED IT, IT UNLEASHED JOB CREATION AND BEGAN PAYING DOWN THE DEBT. IN OHIO, I HAVE WRITTEN THREE BALANCED BUDGETS AND THE LAST ONE JUST 3 1/2 MONTHS AGO. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW HOW TO DO AND SOMETHING THAT I HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: HOW DO YOU DO IT? IT STARTS BY SETTING YOUR PRIORITIES. THAT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT. BUT THEN HAVING THE COURAGE TO MAKE CHOICES THAT COULD BE UNPOPULAR. IN OUR CASE, WE NEED TO REFORM ENTITLEMENTS TO MAKE THEM PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES AND CONTROL THEIR SKYROCKETING, UNSUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATES. AND LET ME BE CLEAR -- YOU CAN HAVE NO BALANCED BUDGET WITHOUT DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF ENTITLEMENTS. TO CHANGE THOSE ENTITLEMENTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE THEM SUSTAINABLE, BUT YET DELIVERING SERVICES ARE PEOPLE NEED. I HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE. AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. THERE IS ALSO PLENTY OF WASTE IN WASHINGTON'S DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS THAT CAN BE CUT. SHOCKING, ISN'T IT? FOR INSTANCE, DO WE REALLY NEED TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES INSPECT -- INSPECTING CATFISH? THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION INSPECTS OUR SEAFOOD SO WHY DO WE NEED THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TO SPEND $14 MILLION A YEAR INSPECTING CATFISH? IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY HERE BUT IN WASHINGTON THEY LEAVE THAT ON THE FLOOR WHEN THEY TURN OUT THE LIGHTS. BUT WE WILL CLAIM ABOU -- CLEAN IT UP. THE U.S. EPA HAS SPENT OVER $15 MILLION ON P.R. CONSULTANTS. THEY ALREADY HAVE A STAFF TELLING US HOW GREAT THEY ARE DOING. I DON'T THINK GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE SPENDING THAT MUCH OF OUR MONEY TRYING TO CONVINCE US TO LIKE IT. JUST DO YOUR JOB AND CUT OUT THE WASTE. THESE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF HOW WE CAN EASILY SAVE OR WHERE WE NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON OUR MILITARY WHILE ALSO STREAMLINING THE PENTAGON BUREAUCRACY SO THAT MEN AND WOMEN IN HARM'S WAY GET THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM EVERY NEW DEFENSE DOLLAR. I SPENT 18 YEARS OF MY CAREER IN WASHINGTON FIGHTING THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE RED TAPE AND DUPLICATION AND DELAY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR DEFENSE, BUT WE NEED TO STREAMLINE AND REBUILD THE BUREAUCRACY INSIDE THAT BUILDING AND AS PRESIDENT I WILL LOOK ACROSS THAT RIVER EVERY SINGLE DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND IS GOING TO HELP OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY AND NOT BUREAUCRACY. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: AMERICA'S TAXES ARE ALSO TOO HIGH. WE WILL CUT THEM SO AMERICANS HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS AND MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN LIVES AND BETTER JOB OPPORTUNITIES. LOOK, YOU KNOW BETTER HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY YOU HAVE IN YOUR POCKET THAN SENDING IT TO SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON SO THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU. IN OHIO, WE CUT TAXES BY $5 BILLION WHILE TURNING THAT $8 BILLION PROJECTED SHORTFALL INTO A SURPLUS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL CUT TAXES AND WE WILL NOT ONLY CUT TAXES BUT WE WILL BALANCE OUR BUDGET IN EIGHT YEARS. BOTH OF THEM, BECAUSE THE BALANCING OF A BUDGET NEEDS ECONOMIC GROWTH AND YOU MANAGE YOUR SPENDING. BOTH LEAD US TO A BALANCED BUDGET WHICH ULTIMATELY CAN LEAD US TO A PLACE WHERE WE BEGIN TO PAY DOWN OUR NATIONAL DEBT. PRESIDENT REAGAN SET THE TOP INCOME TAX RATE AT 28%, AND IT UNLEASHED A DECADE OF GROWTH. WE WILL ALSO KILL THE DEATH TAX BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO VISIT THE UNDERTAKER AND THE TAX COLLECTOR ON THE SAME DAY. SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD BE ABLE TO PASS BUSINESSES ON TO THEIR CHILDREN WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL THE BUSINESS TO PAY THE TAXES, MOST OF WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY PAID. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: BY THE WAY, WE KILLED THE DEATH TAX IN OHIO. AND SMALL BUSINESSES APPRECIATE IT. LOW INCOME AMERICANS ALSO NEED TAX CUTS JUST FOR THEM. WE INCREASED THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BY 10%. WE ELIMINATE FRAUD IN THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO SAVE TAXPAYERS MONEY AND REWARD LOW INCOME WORKERS AT THE SAME TIME. THE PHILOSOPHY IS AS WE BRING DOWN THE LOWER RATE TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR MORE INVESTMENT, WE ARE RISK-TAKING AND MORE JOB GROWTH, WE WANT TO PROVIDE THE TAX RELIEF TO PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END SO THEY HAVE INCENTIVES TO WORK HARDER AND GET AHEAD, NOT BE PUNISHED BECAUSE THEY PUT MORE TIME IN. IT IS AN ACCORDION. HELP THOSE AT THE BOTTOM BECOME MORE SUCCESSFUL AND BRING THE TOP DOWN. FOR BUSINESSES, THE TOP RATE WILL BE 25%. THIS BRINGS US BACK TO A LEVEL THAT IS GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE. TO HELP JOB CREATORS GET THE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT TO GROW AND BE MORE PRODUCTIVE, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONDUCT A FULL COST OF INVESTMENTS THE SAME YEAR THEY BUY THEM. FOLKS, WHEN BUSINESSES HAS THE INCENTIVE TO PUT THE EQUIPMENT IN THE OPERATIONS SO WORKERS CAN BE MORE PRODUCTIVE, WORKERS WILL GET HIGHER WAGES. AND IN OUR STATE, WAGES ARE GROWING FASTER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. IT HELPS THESE BUSINESSES TO CREATE MORE JOBS AND PAY THOSE HIGHER WAGES. AND BY CUTTING TAX RATES AND SIMPLIFYING THE TAX CODE, WE WILL ALSO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR BUSINESSES TO BRING BACK TO THE U.S. THE MONEY THEY HAVE BEEN STORING OVERSEAS. COMPANIES ARE MAKING PROFITS. WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE AN ESTIMATED $2 TRILLION IN PROFITS THAT ARE SITTING IN EUROPE, THAT THEY ARE BEGINNING TO INVEST IN EUROPE INSTEAD OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE THAT MONEY COME BACK HERE SO THEY BEGIN TO INVEST IN AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN FACTORIES AND AMERICAN EQUIPMENT? THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE ARE GOING TO CUT THOSE TAXES. BECAUSE THEY DO WANT TO INVEST HERE, BUT WE HAVE CLOBBERED THEM AND HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BRING THAT MONEY HOME. YOU TALK ABOUT A STIMULUS PACKAGE? THIS COULD BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL STIMULUS PACKAGE I'VE EVER SEEN BY LETTING THE PRIVATE SECTOR DO THE THINGS THEY WANT TO DO TO INVEST HERE IN THE U.S. AND TO SPARK A WAVE OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION, WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. SO WHEN YOU YOUNG PEOPLE CREATE A SMALL BUSINESS AND INVENT THE NEW GOOGLE, WE WILL GIVE YOU INCENTIVES TO DO IT MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER. AMERICA NEEDS A FAIR AND HONEST TAX COLLECTION SYSTEM. I HAVE WORDS HERE ON A PAGE. WE WILL CHANGE THE IRS. NO MORE SOMETHING THAT WE LIVE IN FEAR OF, THAT HAS BIAS, THAT HAS TARGETED PEOPLE. NO MORE. WE WILL CLEAN UP THE IRS AND THAT IS ONE THING EVERYBODY IN AMERICA WILL AGREE TO. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: SO THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT THAT ARE JUST AS INEFFICIENT AS THE IRS. THE RED TAPE AND REGULATION THAT STEADILY FLOW FROM GOVERNMENT A -- AGENCIES ARE DROWNING JOB CREATORS AND OFTEN DON'T REFLECT THE WILL OF CONGRESS. WE CAN FIX THIS BY RETURNING COMMENTS SENSE TO AGENCY REGULATIONS. WE START BY GIVING AMERICA A ONE-YEAR BREAK FROM ALL NEW MAJOR REGULATIONS SO WE CAN CATCH OUR BREATH. NO MORE RULES AND REGULATIONS FROM WASHINGTON FOR ONE YEAR SO WE CAN BEGIN TO GET ON TOP OF THIS. WE WILL REBUILD OUR REGULATORY SYSTEM AND RID IT OF THE ABUSES AND MISTAKES WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. BAD REGULATIONS CAN DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD, SO WE WILL REQUIRE REAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. THE BENEFIT OUGHT TO OUTWEIGH THE COST. WE GIVE LIP SERVICE TO IT, BUT WE WILL CHANGE IT AND ASK CONGRESS TO MAKE THIS MANDATORY. I WILL CALL ON CONGRESS TO DO THEIR JOB AND REQUEST THAT ANY REGULATION THAT COSTS MORE THAN $100 MILLION GOES BACK TO THEM FOR APPROVAL. NO MORE REGULATORS PASSING THESE LAWS THAT THEY WERE NEVER ELECTED TO DO. CONGRESS HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTROL IT, AND WE WILL MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS AND THAT JOB CREATORS HAVE A FAIR CHANCE WHEN THEY OBJECT TO AN AGENCY'S DECISION. WE WILL CREATE A COURT OF COMMON SENSE. IT WILL BE MADE UP OF REAL AMERICANS WHO I WILL APPOINT AS THE PRESIDENT WHO WILL REVIEW AGENCY DECISIONS THAT DO NOT REFLECT COMMON SENSE. YOU WILL HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO AND SOMEONE WHO WILL LISTEN TO YOU. AND PERHAPS EVEN SOMEONE WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IT MUST USE THE AGENCIES ON -OWN APPEALS PROCESS STAFFED BY ITS OWN BUREAUCRATS. WE GO TO THE AGENCY AND APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE AGENCY TELL US IF WE ARE RIGHT OR WRONG. THAT WORKS OUT GREAT, DOESN'T IT? WE NEED A BETTER WAY. WE NEED A METHOD THAT IS TRULY FAIR AND INDEPENDENT. SPEAKING OF REGULATION, THERE HAS BEEN NO SINGLE AREA OF AMERICA THAT HAS BEEN MORE STRANGLED BY REGULATIONS THAN ENERGY. WHY HAS WASHINGTON WORKED SO HARD TO KEEP AMERICA FROM HARNESSING ITS ENERGY ADVANTAGE? WE HAVE TO SET PEOPLE FREE TO MAKE US ENERGY INDEPENDENT IN NORTH AMERICA AND PARTICULARLY HERE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: WE NEED AN ALL-OF-THE-ABOVE ENERGY POLICY. MAKE SURE WE PRODUCE MORE ENERGY FROM OIL AND GAS, FROM NUCLEAR, FROM COLD THAT WE DID CLEAN AND BURN, ALTERNATIVES AND RENEWABLES AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN FIND AND WE WILL DO IT RESPONSIBLY. WE NEED ALL AND IT SHOULD COME FROM RIGHT HERE. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO RELY ON ENERGY FROM OVERSEAS. OUR GOAL WILL BE TO MEET THE NATION'S ENERGY NEEDS FROM NORTH AMERICA, AND TO SUSTAIN IT, WITH THE RIGHT POLICIES IN PLACE, WE CAN WORK WITH OUR CLOSEST NEIGHBORS, CANADA AND MEXICO TO TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN NEEDS WITHOUT HAVING TO DEPEND ON FOUR OF COUNTRIES WERE DANGEROUS PARTS OF THE WORLD. THAT MEANS APPROVING THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE. ENOUGH WITH THE DELAY. WE WILL APPROVE THE PIPELINE BECAUSE ENERGY FREEDOM IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. WE DON'T WANT WARS. WHEN IT IS ALL ABOUT ENERGY, WHEN WE CAN DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN AMERICA TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT, AND WE ARE ON THE ROAD TO GETTING IT DONE. AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, WE WILL ACCOMPLISH IT. JUST AS WE SET OURSELVES FREE FROM ENERGY OVERSEAS, WE HAVE GOT TO BE SMARTER AND STRONGER ABOUT TRADING WITH COUNTRIES OVERSEAS. WE ARE INVENTORS. WE LOVE TO MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA. WE MAKE THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD AND OPEN MARKETS CAN WORLD, AND OPEN MARKETS CAN CREATE NEW JOBS FOR US HERE AT HOME. TRADE CAN ALSO MAKE THE WORLD MORE STABLE AND ADVANCE OUR NATIONAL INTEREST. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, TOO OFTEN WASHINGTON GIVES US THE FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN FREE TRADE OR NO TRADE. WE HAVE TO REJECT THAT AND BECOME BETTER NEGOTIATORS OF THE TRADE PACTS WE WANT TO PUT IN PLACE. AND I WILL TELL YOU, WE SHOULD ONLY AGREE TO DEALS THAT ARE FAIR TO AMERICAN WORKERS, AND THAT INCLUDES TAKING A FIRM STAND AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT CHEAT, THOSE THAT MANIPULATE CURRENCIES TO GET AN ADVANTAGE. YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE UNDERSTAND THIS AND OHIO. WE WILL CALL THEM ON IT AND HAVE AN EXPEDITED PROCESS TO STAND UP FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER. AND THAT IS CRITICAL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TRADE. [APPLAUSE] MR. KASICH: WE CANNOT LET THESE ISSUES DELAY WHENEVER WE SEE VIOLATIONS OF TRADE AGREEMENTS BECAUSE BUREAUCRATIC WHEELS GRIND SO SLOWLY. WE WILL BRING THEM FAST AND MAKE SURE WE DO A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING AMERICA FROM GETTING RIPPED OFF. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ARE OPEN TO TRADE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT REINFORCE THOSE AGREEMENTS EFFECTIVELY. THE JOBS WE TALK ABOUT WILL NOT BE IN WASHINGTON. THEY WILL NOT BE CREATED BY GOVERNMENT. THEY WILL BE CREATED BY AMERICANS IN TOWNS LIKE NASHUA AND MANCHESTER AND IN MY HOMETOWN OF WESTERVILLE. THAT'S WHERE WE LIVE AND WHERE THE POWER OF OUR NATION COMES FROM. IT'S TIME TO MAKE WASHINGTON RESPECT THAT, AND AS PRESIDENT I WILL WORK TO TRANSFER INFLUENCE AND POWER OUT OF WASHINGTON AND BACK TO WHERE WE LIVE, WHERE WE WORK, IN THE STATES AND TOWNS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND IT STARTS WITH EDUCATION. WASHINGTON ISN'T THE NATION'S SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, AND IT SURE ISN'T ITS TEACHER. IT'S TIME WASHINGTON STOP MICROMANAGING EDUCATION. EDUCATION IS A LOCAL ISSUE TO BE DECIDED BY PARENTS, OUR COMMUNITIES, AND OUR LOCAL EDUCATORS. YES, WE NEED HIGH STANDARDS. BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T SET THEM OR CONTROL THEM. I WILL REDUCE THE POWER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I WILL CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN 100 FEDERAL PROGRAMS, 100 PROGRAMS, RED TAPE BUREAUCRACY, BUREAUCRATS, I WILL BUNDLE THEM INTO FOUR, AND I WILL SEND THE RESOURCES BACK TO THE STATES FOR US TO RUN EDUCATION OURSELVES. [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT I LOOK FORWARD TO TRAVELING THE COUNTRY TO SHARE THE BEST IDEAS FOR OUR STATES AND FOR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT ARE IMPROVING EDUCATION. THE BEST IDEAS COME FROM RIGHT HERE AND WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF SHARING THOSE THINGS THAT WORK. EXCITING THINGS IN THE 21ST CENTURY TO GIVE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED. WE WILL TAKE THIS APPROACH ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S POWER STRUCTURE WERE EVER WE CAN. WE MUST TAKE THESE BACK TO THE STATE SO THEY CAN RESPOND IN THEIR UNIQUE WAYS. ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL DOESN'T WORK. WE CAN DO IT WITH INFRASTRUCTURE, NOT JUST WITH EDUCATION BUT WITH INFRASTRUCTURE. THE INTERSTATE PROGRAM IS UNFINISHED. THERE IS NO NEED FOR A COSTLY FEDERAL HIGHWAY BUREAUCRACY THAT TAKE OUR MONEY AND GIVES IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. I WILL RETURN FEDERAL GAS TAXES TO THE STATE, LEAVING A SLIVER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR TRULY NATIONAL NEEDS AND THE INTERSTATE PROGRAM IS DOWNSIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND GIVE IT A SMALLER ROLE SUPPORTING STATES WITH RESEARCH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. FEDERAL SPENDING WILL GO DOWN, RESOURCES FOR HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT CAN GO UP AND STATES CAN WORK FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. KEEP YOUR MONEY AND FIX YOUR ROADS THE WAY YOU WANT TO. NO MORE TAKING GAS TAX MONEY TO WASHINGTON. CUT SOME OFF-THE-WALL -- KEEP IT RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR WHAT YOU NEED, AND IF YOU DON'T NEED IT YOU CAN SEND IT TO OHIO. IT'S CRITICAL WE CAN GIVE STATES THE FREEDOM TO HELP AMERICANS KEEP THEIR SKILLS SHARP AND COMPETITIVE. THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE IS ALL ABOUT, TRAINING AND EDUCATION IS A LIFELONG ENDEAVOR. YOU CANNOT STOP AFTER YOU GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, VOCATIONAL SCHOOL, COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR THE UNIVERSITY. IT IS LIFELONG. WASHINGTON DOESN'T. LET STATES PURSUE THEIR OWN IDEAS THE RESULT IS WORKERS USUALLY CAN'T GET TRAINING HELP UNLESS THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS FIRST. MUCH OF THE MONEY ONLY GET SENT TO THE STATES WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO TRAIN PEOPLE ONCE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB RATHER THAN TRAINING THEM WHILE THEY HAVE THEIR JOB SO THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR JOB. THAT'S THE WASHINGTON MENTALITY FOR YOU. WE WILL WRAP UP ALL THOSE JOB-TRAINING PROGRAMS AND IN THEM TO EACH AND EVERY STATE TO DEAL WITH THEIR WORKERS AND ECONOMIC SITUATION AND TAKE IT OUT OF WASHINGTON, D C AND SET OURSELVES FREE TO MAKE SURE OUR PEOPLE CAN BE PROSPEROUS. I HOPE YOU AGREE. [APPLAUSE] I WILL SEND MEDICAID BACK TO THE STATES AS WELL. WASHINGTON MAKES IT SO HARD TO TRY NEW IDEAS, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH NOTHING EVER GETS DONE. IN OHIO, WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH INSURANCE. BETTER CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, AND THE PRACTICE OF PAYING FOR VALUE, NOT JUST VOLUME. THESE IDEAS CAN ALSO BE PUT TO WORK HELPING RESTRAIN COSTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAM FOR SENIORS, MEDICARE. IT IS FISCALLY STRONG AND THERE TO HELP THEM. WHILE THESE IDEAS CAN HELP US BEGIN IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL. WE CAN DO IT IF WASHINGTON WAS JUST SMARTER ABOUT THE NEED TO TRY A NERVE ROACH -- A NEW APPROACH. LET ME BE CLEAR. WE HAVE A PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE MEDICARE IS SET ON A FIRM BASIS. AND THAT MEDICAID CAN BE SENT BACK TO THE STATE, SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE 90'S. SO THAT GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATORS CAN'T COME UP WITH MORE INNOVATIVE AND PRACTICAL WAYS -- CAN'T COME UP -- CAN COME UP WITH MORE INNOVATIVE AND PRACTICAL WAYS. THE SAME IS ALSO TRUE IN WELFARE. CUTTING WASHINGTON'S STRINGS OF SO STATES CAN HELP PEOPLE MOVE UP AND OUT OF POVERTY. IN OHIO, WE ARE PROUD TO BE INNOVATIVE. GUIDED BY THE SAME IDEAS MY MOM USED TO SAY, IT IS A SIN NOT TO HELP SOMEBODY THAT NEEDS HELP BUT IT IS EQUALLY AS SIN TO HELP SOMEBODY THAT NEEDS TO HELP THEMSELVES. WE ARE ASKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PERMISSION TO ALLOW OUR PEOPLE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO GET EDUCATION SO THEY CAN GET A JOB. WE HAVE TO ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO APPROVE THIS. IT IS NONSENSE, LET ME RUN IT. LET MY LEGISLATURE RUN IT. LET US TAILOR A WELFARE PROGRAM IN OHIO YOU CAN USE AND LEARN HERE AND THAT THE COMMAND MY STATE -- WE CAN LEARN IN IN MY STATE. >> WE WILL LEAVE THIS LIFE TO TAKE YOU LIVE TO THE WHITE HOUSE WE NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN NOW. WE HAVE TO GET OUR GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY, BALANCE OUR BUDGET, CUT TAXES. WE NEED TO TAKE BACK OUR POWER AND MONEY AND INFLUENCE AND GET THE RED TAPE AND REGULATORS BACK UNDER CONTROL. LET US WIN OUR ENERGY FREEDOM. LET US GET SMART ON TRADE. IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER AS ONE STRATEGY. IF WE WANT TO SEE RESULTS NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. I'M FIGHTING FOR THE 50-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO LOST HER JOB IN THIS BAD ECONOMY. IT COULD GROW AND GIVE HER A NEW OPPORTUNITY IF THEY WEREN'T DROWNING IN HIGH TAXES AND RED TAPE. I'M FIGHTING FOR THE STARTUPS WITH BREAKTHROUGH IDEAS THAT COULD HIRE THE SINGLE MOMS, STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE IT FUTURE FOR HER KIDS. I'M FIGHTING FOR THEM THAT AND WOMEN WHOSE WAGES HAVE BEEN FLAT FOR SEVEN YEARS. I'M FIGHTING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THEIR WHOLE LIVES AHEAD OF THEM, WONDERING IF THEY WILL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THE GENERATION BEFORE THEM. THE IDEAS I'M PUTTING OUT TODAY ARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTS A BRIGHTER AND BETTER FUTURE. IS IT EASY, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO GET THIS DONE. THIS IS DOABLE AND ACHIEVABLE TO HELP OUR COUNTRY. THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING AGAINST US. THAT IS INEVITABLE. THERE ARE GOING TO BE SKEPTICS. I BECOME PRESIDENT, RELYING ON YOU FOR YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT. I HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. THAT WORKS FOR ME IN RALLYING SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU. WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN NOW, NO MORE WILLING AROUND, NO MORE DELAY, NO MORE CONFUSION, NO MORE INEXPERIENCE, NO MORE FOCUS GROUPS, NOW WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE. HE'S GOING TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET, WE DID IT BEFORE. HE'S GOING TO CUT TAXES, HE HAS DONE IT BEFORE. WE CAN SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS , HE HAS DONE IT BEFORE. HE IS GOING TO CONTROL THE REGULATORS. IN OHIO WE HAVE WITH OUR COMMON SENSE INITIATIVE. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO DEVELOP ENERGY AND MAKES IT INDEPENDENT. IT'S WORKING AND IT IS EXCITING. HE SAID HE WANTS TO CHANGE WELFARE. YOU ASKED THEM TO RESUME PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. HE SAID WE NEED TO STAND UP. WE NEED TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN WORKER AT THE SAME TIME WE REACH ACROSS THE OCEANS AND MAKE SURE OUR PRODUCTS CAN FIND MARKETS. I DON'T WANT TO WRITE ANOTHER BOOK BECAUSE I'M IN POLITICS, I DON'T NEED ANOTHER TELEVISION SHOW. THE GOOD LORD HAS BLESSED ME. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE MY LIFETIME A HAS GIVEN ME THE SKILLS, GIVEN ME THE FRIENDS, GIVEN ME THE INSTINCTS AND THE JUDGMENT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE NATION STRONG AND RESPECTED ALL OVER THE WORLD AGAIN. I NEED YOU RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. NO MORE POLITICS, NO MORE NONSENSE, WE WILL GET DOWN TO IT. AMERICA WILL BE A BRIGHTER, STRONGER, MORE HELPFUL PLACE AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE CAN DO OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU. >> THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN KIND AND GENEROUS ENOUGH WITH HIS TIME TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR STUDENT FORUM. BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR CHANCELLOR TO TALK ABOUT THE FORUM. DR.? [INAUDIBLE] AS YOU TALK ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURES, OUR STUDENTS, AND NATIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR 27,000 STUDENTS ARE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY HAVE A HUGE STAKE IN THIS ELECTION, AND WE WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE'S FIRST -- AND TO GET DIRECTLY TO ENGAGE WITH THE CANDIDATES. THEY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS OPPORTUNITY AND WE THANK YOU FOR TAKING THEIR QUESTIONS. >> OLIVER QUESTION IS FROM RYAN. RYAN: HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT? YOU KNOW WHY GOD INVENTED ECONOMISTS? TO MAKE ASTROLOGIST'S LOOK ACCURATE. RYAN : WHAT SECTORS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING WOULD YOU ADVOCATE LOWERING OR POSSIBLY ELIMINATING? GOV. KASICH: WE ARE ON THE NONDEFENSIVE DISCRETIONARY, WE ARE GOING TO FREEZE THAT FOR EIGHT YEARS. THAT IS JUST A STARTING POINT. WE DIG IN AND GET UNDER THE HOOD. WE WILL INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE A LOT OF THE BACKLOG WE NEED BECAUSE DEFENSE IS OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE. AND WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH THESE ENTITLEMENTS. MEDICAID WILL CONTINUE TO REFORM. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE -- WE NEED TO BE SURE WE ARE ABLE TO STABILIZE MEDICARE. WE HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ON HOW WE CAN DO THAT. AND IF YOU CUT TAXES AND CONTROL SPENDING YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET TO A BALANCED BUDGET. I HAVE TO COUNT ON YOU BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHINING ABOUT, YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME. WE ARE USED TO THAT. WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO GET IT DONE. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. IT IS ABOUT RAISING AMERICA TO A LEVEL WHERE PEOPLE HAVE -- WHERE PEOPLE REALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. -- WHERE REAL PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY. >> WITH SOCIAL SECURITY BEING RAISED TO 67, YOUNGER PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A JOB. PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 24 HAVE AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 9.1%. THIS NEAR 4% HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE NATIONAL SECURITY'S OLD PEOPLE CAN HAVE SAFE RETIREMENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE CAN HAVE JOB STABILITY? GOV. KASICH: A LOT OF 18-YEAR-OLDS THINK THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SEEING A UFO THAN A SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK. IN 1999I PROPOSED A SOLUTION, A FIX TO SOCIAL SECURITY THAT WAS STABILIZED FOR 100 YEARS. THE BABY BOOMERS WOULD HAVE STARTED IN A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET 2% PRIVATE ACCOUNTS, WHERE YOU COULD BE CONNECTED TO THE ECONOMY JUST LIKE FEDERAL WORKERS. THAT WAS ABOUT 16 YEARS AGO. NOW WE ARE IN A DEEPER HOLE AND WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS OF SOCIAL SECURITY. THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF EARLY RETIREMENT, WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF RAISING RETIREMENT AGE, WE DO NEED TO HAVE INDICES OF PRICES. THOSE THINGS WILL GET US IN A PRETTY GOOD PLACE. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT WE PAY IN AND GET OUT. SOCIAL SECURITY IS SO SENSITIVE IT HAS TO BE STABILIZED. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO INCLUDE SOME DEMOCRATS WHO UNDERSTAND THIS PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE ASKED. WE WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT, WHICH IS A SEPARATE ISSUE THAN GETTING US FROM BALANCING THIS BUDGET TODAY. THANK YOU. >> OUR SECOND STUDENT IS A COMMUNICATIONS MAJOR. AMANDA? AMANDA: GOOD MORNING. MY QUESTION ALSO INVOLVE SOCIAL SECURITY. ACCORDING TO VARIOUS NEWS SOURCES, SUCH AS WASHINGTON TIMES, THE NEW YORK TIMES, AND WASHINGTON EXAMINER, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL RUN OUT BY 2016. I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID PEOPLE HAVE TO GET OVER SOCIAL SECURITY CUTS P.M. WHAT ABOUT THE GRANITE STATE CITIZENS WHO HAVE PAID INTO SOCIAL SECURITY THEIR ENTIRE LIVES? CAN AND HOW WILL YOU ASSERT -- HOW WILL YOU ASSURE THEM THEY WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF? GOV. KASICH: IN THE AREA OF SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY, IT SHOWS. WHEN SOMEBODY IS DISABLED, THAT THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE POSITION WHERE THEY CAN GET HELP, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST APPROACHING A LEGAL SYSTEM TO TRY TO GET THEM OUT AND QUALIFY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE ON. MY MIND ISN'T CLOSED ON THAT. IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT. HERE IS WHAT THE STORY IS ON THE BENEFITS. IF WE START SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WITH AN INDICES THAT IS LOWER, THEN YOU ARE GOING TO GET A SOCIAL SECURITY SLIGHTLY LOWER THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SAVING THE PROGRAM FROM WHAT YOU WANT ANYWAY. WE WERE IN A FORUM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WE WERE ALL CHUCKLING ABOUT WHERE WE START. MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BENEFITED US, THAT YOU CALCULATED DOWN TO THE DOLLAR. I SAID WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START A LITTLE BIT LOWER. WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT AND WE ALL KIND OF CHUCKLED. I SAID WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ALL GET OVER IT. THAT IS PART OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SAY THINGS. THAT IS PART OF WHY WE DON'T GET ANYWHERE. WE GET DISTRACTED BY A CRITICISM. I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE I'M GOING TO BE DISTRACTED. I HAVE TAKEN HEAT FROM REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, FROM REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBERS, FROM DEMOCRATS. IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO TAKE THE HEAT, GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN. GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN, THANK YOU. I WANT YOU TO GET A JOB. IF THERE IS ANYTHING WE NEED TO DO IT IS TO EMPHASIZE THE CAPABILITY OF THESE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS TO GIVE YOU A SKILL FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN YOUR LIFETIME. SKILL IS THE MATTER AND THOSE ARE THE WORDS NOT JUST FOR YOU BUT FOR MY YOUNGER DAUGHTERS, WHO WILL ONE DAY BE IN SCHOOL LIKE YOU ARE TODAY. THANK YOU. AMANDA: THANK YOU GOVERNOR KASICH. [APPLAUSE] >> OUR THIRD STUDENT IS A LIBERAL ARTS MAJOR WHO HAILS FROM NASHUA. [APPLAUSE] NATE: YOU SERVED SIX YEARS AS CHAIRMAN OF THE -- AS CHAIRMAN BALANCING THE OHIO BUDGET. WOULD YOU CONSIDER MODIFYING THE TAX CODE AND GETTING RID OF LOOPHOLES? GOV. KASICH: WE ALWAYS WANT TO LOOK AT PROVISIONS IN THE CODE THAT WERE PUT THERE BY SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. I USED TO SAVE WE CAN REFORM WELFARE FOR PORK PEOPLE -- FOR POOR PEOPLE WE OUGHT TO REFORM WELFARE FOR RICH PEOPLE. SOMETIMES THOSE LOOPHOLES ARE LEGITIMATELY LOOPHOLES AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY, SUCH AS THE RESEARCH CREDIT. YOU HAVE TO SCOUR EVERYTHING. YOU LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM . YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER EVERY POPE -- EVERY PROGRAM HAS SOMETHING THAT SUPPORTS IT. IF WE CAN SEE IT IN THE YELLOW PAGES, DOES GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO DO IT? CAN WE MAKE IT WORK BETTER, MORE EFFECTIVELY? YOU JUST GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT. EVERYTHING GETS LOOKED AT APPROPRIATELY. THE TIME YOU COME OFF THE MORAL HIGH GROUND IS WHERE IT IS PRETTY HARD TO LEAD. WE WILL LOOK AT EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THESE KINDS OF THINGS WE USED TO CALL LOOPHOLES. MAYBE YOU CAN COME AND BE A JUNIOR PARTNER AND YOU CAN HELP US LOOK AT THINGS. NATE: WOULD YOU SUPPORT A BASIC UNIVERSAL INCOME? GOV. KASICH: A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE PAYING OTHER TAXES, SIGNIFICANT TAXES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE PEOPLE AN INCENTIVE. I PROPOSE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT, WHICH I FOUGHT FOR AS A CONGRESSMAN. I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GIVE PEOPLE AN INCENTIVE TO RISE. WE ARE RAISING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU CAN MAKE, 300 PERCENT OF POVERTY WITHOUT LOSING CHILDCARE. THERE ARE MANY RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT KEEP YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO RISE BECAUSE YOU LOSE MORE THAN YOU GAIN. WE HAVE TO BE SURE WE TAILOR OUR WELFARE SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE INDEPENDENCE, NOT CONTINUED DEPENDENCE. >> OUR NEXT IT IS A MAJOR IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND COMES FROM BOSTON NEW HAMPSHIRE. CAROLINE: MY QUESTION IS WHERE DO YOU STAND ON PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S PROPOSED FREE TWO-YEAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE? CAN YOU INFORM US HOW OR WHERE THE MONEY WILL COME FROM? GOV. KASICH: WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THINGS. YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A NEW CAR, WOULDN'T YOU? I CAN'T JUST GIVE YOU ONE FOR FREE. WE HAVE TO LEARN TO CONTROL THE COSTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THAT COMES NUMBER ONE TO LEADERSHIP. YOU SOMETIMES HAVE TO AGGRAVATE THE FACULTY, THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AROUND HERE TO TAKE COSTS OUT. IN OHIO WE HAD A GROUP OF PIT -- GROUP OF BUSINESS PEOPLE WHO CAME IN WITH A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE COSTS. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF OHIO STATE? A LITTLE SCHOOL IN THE MIDWEST. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? SO OHIO STATE'S PRESIDENT, WHO IS A GREAT MAN, DEBATED THE DECISION THAT HE WANTED TO LEASE PARKING GARAGES AND PARKING LOT BECAUSE HE SAID WHY IS A UNIVERSITY RUNNING A PARKING GARAGE? HE WAS FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL. OHIO STATE AT LEAST THOSE PARKING LOTS AND PARKING GARAGES, STILL MAINTAINS CONTROL, AND IS RECEIVING HALF $1 BILLION THAT CAN BE USED TO HELP STUDENTS WITH SCHOLARSHIPS OR REDUCE COSTS. THEY HAVE NOW OUTSOURCED THEIR DINING. WHY IS UNIVERSITY RUNNING A DINING FACILITY? IT OUGHT TO BE DONE BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE NEED TO SCOUR EVERYTHING TO REDUCE COSTS. IF THESE COSTS KEEP RISING, STUDENTS ARE JUST GOING TO GO TO ONLINE EDUCATION AT A FRACTION OF THE COST AND IT IS GOING TO BECOME MORE CREATIVE. LET ME SUGGEST ONE OTHER THING, WHEN YOU ENTER THE SCHOOL YOU BETTER HAVE SOMEBODY WHO GUYS YOU VIRTUALLY EVERY WEEK. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, WHAT COURSES ARE YOU TAKING, ARE YOU ON TRACK, AND I'M HERE TO BE YOUR HELP HER. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE IN DEMAND JOBS ARE SO WE ARE NOT GETTING AN EDUCATION FOR BASKET WEAVING WHEN THERE ARE NO BASKET WEAVING JOBS ANYMORE. I DO BELIEVE OTHER UNIVERSITIES OR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SHOULD BE PAID ONE DIME FOR OVERHEAD. THEY SHOULD. BURST BY GOVERNMENT WHEN A STUDENT COMPLETES A COURSE OR GRADUATES. ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT WILL RESULT IN HIGH COSTS WITHOUT PUTTING U.S. THE TOP OF THE HEAP FOR WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE. CAROLINE: SHOULD ABLE-BODIED MENTALLY CAPABLE ADULTS WHO RECEIVED WELFARE BE REQUIRED TO WORK? HOW WOULD YOU MONITOR THIS IF SO? GOV. KASICH: WE WORKED IN CONGRESS TO SAY A FEW GET FOOD STAMPS AND YOU ARE ABLE TO BODY, YOU NEED TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE AT LEAST 20 HOURS PER WEEK AND I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE FOR WELFARE. FOSTERING A CULTURE OF DEPENDENCY HELPS NO ONE. IT DOESN'T HELP THE CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE FAMILY. LET'S NOT THINK THIS IS EASY. YOU GROW UP, YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, YOU DON'T HAVE A STABLE FAMILY. YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS AND YOU WONDER ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY GIVING YOU THE LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT YOU NEED. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF THE LORD. THEY ARE NOT TO BE DISCARDED, NOT TO BE DEMEANED. THEY NEED TO BE LIFTED. BUT YOU DON'T LIFT THEM JUST BY GIVING, YOU HAVE TO EXPECT SOMETHING BACK. NO MORE STRINGS, YOU DO IT, YOU TELL ME WHAT IS WORKING HERE. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS WORKING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. IT IS EQUALLY A SIN TO CONTINUE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO NEED TO LEARN HOW TO HELP THEMSELVES. THESE ARE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS, AND OUR SCHOOLS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE -- LOCAL LEVEL MUST BE MADE EXCELLENT. THANK YOU. >> OUR LAST SPEAKER IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE MAJOR FROM NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND I GOOD MORNING EVERYONE, GOVERNOR. WHAT IDEAS DO YOU HAVE TO REDUCE THE OVERALL DEBT IN STUDENT LOANS THAT MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE? GOV. KASICH: YOU NEED TO STOP THE COST DRIVER. ARE YOU GOING ONTO A FOUR YEAR SCHOOL? YOU HAVE ALREADY CUT YOUR COSTS. YOU ARE HERE WHERE IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN IN THE FOUR YEARS. WE HAVE OUTLINED A NUMBER OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO GET ON TOP OF THIS WHOLE COST ISSUE. IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET COLLEGE CREDIT. SOME STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED ALMOST AN ENTIRE YEAR OF COLLEGE WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHEN THEY TEACH, THE STUDENTS CAN GET COLLEGE CREDIT. IT IS A WHOLE MEMBER OF THINGS. WHEN YOU ARE A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TODAY, WHAT YOU THINK YOUR GOAL IS FOR TOMORROW? SOMETIMES IT IS REALLY HARD TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN, BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO AGAINST THE GRAIN EVERYBODY GETS UPTIGHT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT LEADERS TO? WHY AM I MADE THIS WAY? BECAUSE I HAD A MOM WHO SHOOK THINGS UP TOP TO BOTTOM. SHE WAS MY MODEL IN HOW YOU STUCK AND HUNG TOUGH. WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING, WHATEVER IT IS, IF YOU ARE RIGHT AND NEED TO CHECK WITH YOUR FRIENDS, EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG CROWD YOU KEEP PURSUING IT. YOU WILL HAVE THE CROWD AND BE THE LEADER. LEADERS ALWAYS STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD. YOU GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF THE CROWD AND THEY CAN'T HEAR OR SEE YOU. THERE IS A CERTAIN SKILL ABOUT KNOWING HOW FAR TO GET AND HOW TO BRING THE CROWD ALONG WITH YOU BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT ALL YOURSELF. SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO, LIKE YOU, SUPPORT YOU AND REINFORCES YOU. GOOD LUCK TO YOU. YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION, I THOUGHT I WAS DONE. >> WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS TO LET IN EACH EAR? WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO HELP THESE PEOPLE WITHOUT PUTTING A STRAIN ON SOCIAL SERVICES? >> WE HAVE IMMIGRATION LAW WHO LIMITS WHO COMES IN. NOW OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM PEOPLE WHO WALK OUT IN THE COUNTRY. I WAS TALKING TO A MAN WHO ASKED ME -- I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF A WALL. I SAID TO HIM WHERE DO YOU LIVE? I SAID I LIVE IN WASHINGTON DC. DO YOU LOCK YOUR DOORS AT NIGHT? I SAID I DO. SHOULD A COUNTRY LOCKET STORES? WE HAVE TO FINISH THAT WALL. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CAN CONTROL OUR BORDERS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, BUT THEN WE OUGHT TO HAVE GUESSWORK FOR PROGRAMS SO PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND OUT LEGALLY. AND IF THEY HAVEN'T VIOLATED THE LAW, THEY CAN GET A PATH TO LEGALIZATION. THEN I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT OUR ENTIRE IMMIGRATION PROGRAM. I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY, MY MOTHER COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH CREATIVE MY FATHER'S PARENTS CAME OVER. WE WEREN'T EVEN SURE WHAT OUR REAL NAME WAS BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER MAY HAVE TAKEN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY THAT HE CAME ON NO DISH CAME OVER ON THE BOAT WITH CREATIVE IF I HAD GOT HERE I PROBABLY WOULD BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF CROATIA. SO WE WANT TO WELCOME IMMIGRANTS, IT MAKES US STRONGER AND BETTER, BUT WE WANT TO CONTROL IT. AND WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO COME HERE JUST TO GET ON SOME BENEFIT. WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME HERE AND ASSIMILATE THEMSELVES AND WORK AND CONTRIBUTE. WHICH I BELIEVE MOST OF THEM TO -- MOST OF THEM DO. THANK YOU. >> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THEIR PROFESSOR FOR HER HARD WORK IN WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THIS COURSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR, WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO MEET AND SPEAK WITH MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION AND BEING A BUCKEYE, WE THANK YOU FOR WEARING THE RIGHT COLORS TODAY. THANK YOU AND PLEASE JOIN US FOR A RECEPTION HONORING -- FOLLOWING THIS IMMEDIATELY. GOV. KASICH: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) >> WE NEED TO UPGRADE THE VALUE OF GUIDANCE COUNSELORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GOD BLESS. THANK YOU. >> IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO COME TODAY. FAMILY DOES PUT OUT EDUCATION PROGRAMS ABOUT HOW TO CONTROL COSTS. I WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK. >> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. I ENJOYED BEING HERE. >> HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> HE'S BEEN TELLING ME HOW TO DO MY JOB FOR 25 YEARS. >> GIVE ME ONE SECOND. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CAMPAIGN GOVERNOR? GOV. KASICH: IT IS GOOD TO BE ALSO TALK NOW AND INCREASE THE WILL ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS. I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR SPECIFICS, AND THAT IS GOOD. I ALSO THINK THIS IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, FOR THE DEBATE. WE DON'T HAVE BEEN BUDGET, CUT TAXES, BE CREATIVE WITH IT, EVERYTHING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT ME. SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE GOOD BECAUSE THEY ARE INHERENTLY GOOD. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BECOME THE FOCUS OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. WE WILL SEE. >> THE IDEA THAT -- WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] -- [INAUDIBLE] GOV. KASICH: WE HAVE A BIT OF GOVERNMENT. THE BULK OF THE TAX CUTS, WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PASS MOST OF THE INCREASES. I WANT TO GO FROM A CONSUMPTION-BASED TO AN INVESTMENT-BASED ECONOMY. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE BULK OF THESE BECAUSE WE PRODUCE GOVERNMENT. WE COULD GO LOWER IN OHIO IF WE SUBSTITUTE CONSUMPTION TAXES FOR INVESTMENT AND LOWERED INCOME TAXES. IT IS ALWAYS FAIR TO HAVE A BIT OF DYNAMIC GROWTH. WE KNOW WE ARE GOING TO GET A BOOST IF WE DO ALL THESE THINGS. WE ARE REDUCING GROWTH TO SPENDING IN THIS PLAN. YOU GROW THE ECONOMY AND REDUCE YOUR OVERHEAD. YOU DON'T DO IT WITH A CHECK OFF THE BOX STRATEGY. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BUDGET PLAN. IT TAKES COMBINATION OF THINGS TO GET YOUR ECONOMY GOING. IT IS REGULATORY, IT IS TAXES, IT IS CONTROLLING SPENDING, IT IS A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS YOU NEED TO DO. JUST ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER IS NOT THE WAY I DO THINGS. THIS IS A DYNAMIC PLAN THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF VOICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT ARE SAYING IF ANYBODY KNOWS HOW TO PASS THESE THINGS IT IS K-6, AND I HAPPEN TO BE BIASED AND AGREE WITH HIM. THOUGHT HE WAS NOT DRAWING THEM DOWN. THAT IS BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND HAS DETERIORATED. I WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE THE SECOND INCREASE. I WOULD HAVE USED SPECIAL FORCES TO BE ABLE TO GO TO BE LETHAL AND MOBILE TO TAKE CARE OF THE JOB. I WOULDN'T HAVE SUPPORTED THE ADDITIONAL TROOPS. NOW THAT THE SITUATION HAS DETERRED UNDERGROUND, IT IS A WISE SITUATION TO SAY WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO GO OUT OF THEIR AND LOSE ALL THE THINGS WE HAD INVESTED OVER THE YEARS. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE IS SAYING, BUT TO ME IT IS PROBABLY A REACTION TO THE 60 MINUTES INTERVIEW WHERE PEOPLE SAID HE LOOKED WEAK. THANK YOU. >> WE KNOW OUR PARTNERSHIP SAVED -- WE KNOW IT WORKS. DO YOU PLAN TO LOOK INTO IT ANY CLOSER? >> WE WILL LOOK INTO IT AT SOME POINT. I HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF AFFECTIVE FOREIGN AID. THERE IS A CHUNK OF FOREIGN AID THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEEDED. WE WILL SEE, BUT I'M OPEN. THANK YOU. >>",2015-11-07 18:03:54,2015-10-15,Nashua,New Hampshire

HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS BROTHERS PRESIDENCY AT THIS EVENT IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] >> I KNOW A LOT OF YOU BECAUSE I SEE A LOT OF FOLKS HERE. I AM CHAIRMAN OF THE DEBATES COMMITTEE SO I GET TO SAY A LOT -- SEE A LOT OF OUR CANDIDATES AND IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE TODAY. AS THE COMMITTEE MAN I AM NEUTRAL BUT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING SOME FRIENDS RUNNING IN THIS RACE AND I HAVE NO BETTER FRIEND THAN OUR GUEST TONIGHT. IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO COME HERE AND SPEND SOME TIME. WE LOVE OUR PRIMARY, ANYONE LOVES IT PEOPLE OF CONCORD DO IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. WE SUMMER AND WINTER AND SUMMER AND WINTER THESE CANDIDATES AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER TONIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL. MY PRIVILEGE IS TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER GOOD FRIEND AND SOMEBODY WHO DOES A TERRIFIC JOB FOR THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY WE PAY HIM AND THAT IS CHUCK MORRIS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATE WHO BROUGHT US SUCH AN INCREDIBLY WELL THOUGHT OUT BUDGET THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE THE CENTER PRESIDENT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. LIKE EVERY CITIZEN IN THE STATE I TAKE WHAT I DO VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WHEN I AM LOOKING AT CANDIDATES I TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT HAVE STRONG VALUES THAT WOULD BE GREAT PRESIDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. I CAN TELL YOU I SAT DOWN AND TALKED WITH MANY OF THEM. THEY HAVE GREAT IDEAS FOR WHAT OUR COUNTRY COULD BE. BUT I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE ONE STANDS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST AND THAT IS JIM BUSH. -- JEB BUSH. [APPLAUSE] I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I AM COCHAIR OF THE JEB BUSH CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHAT WE NEED IN WASHINGTON IS CHANGE. WE NEED A WASHINGTON THAT RUNS LIKE WHAT WE BELIEVE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS REPUBLICANS, AND WHAT JEB BUSH DID IN FLORIDA. HE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. HE REDUCED TAXES EVERY YEAR THAT HE WAS GOVERNOR. HE GREW THE ECONOMY. HE GREW JOBS. THAT IS WHAT WE WANT AS HER PUBLICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WANT EVERYONE TO BETTER THEMSELVES. I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, JEB BUSH. [APPLAUSE] CHUCK: WOULD YOU REMAIN STANDING FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. ALL: I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. JEB BUSH: YOUR ENDORSEMENT IS VERY MEANINGFUL. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT AND WELCOMING ME. I AM FROM FLORIDA. IT IS GREAT TO BE IN A PLACE THAT HONORS THE SPACE PROGRAM. IT IS REALLY GOOD TO BE HERE. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, AMERICA ALWAYS HAS BEEN AN ASPIRATIONAL COUNTRY, HASN'T IT? WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE THINGS THAT DEFIED THE IMAGINATION OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. BEING ABLE TO LAUNCH -- PUT A MAN ON THE MOON, WHICH WAS THE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL IN THE 1960'S WHEN THE RUSSIANS -- EXCUSE ME, SOVIET -- I GET THEM CONFUSED THESE DAYS BECAUSE VLADIMIR PUTIN IS ACTING LIKE A SOVIET. WHEN THEY LAUNCHED THE ROCKET INTO SPACE, IT LIT A FIRE UNDER AMERICA. WE SENT A MAN TO THE MOON. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE ENGINEERING DEFEAT -- FEET. WE DO THAT REGULARLY. WE NEED TO KEEP DOING IT. WHETHER IT IS TO EXPLORE THE STARS OR BRAIN. THINK ABOUT IT, I MEET PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME THAT HAVE LOVED ONES WITH DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE KIND OF FORWARD MOVEMENT IN THE DISCOVERY OF MEDICINES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF ALZHEIMER'S. IN A STATE OF FLORIDA WE HAVE A VOUCHER PROGRAM FOR KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN -- LEARNING DISABILITIES. THERE HAVE BEEN A SURGE OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. IN OUR CASE, WE CAN SEND THOSE PARENTS, IF THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL, CAN SEND THEIR KIDS WITH STATE AND LOCAL MONEY TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF CHALLENGES. THE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES WE SEE PLAYING OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IMAGINE IF WE WERE ASPIRATIONAL AGAIN. I THINK WE HAVE LOST SOME OF THAT SPIRIT. WE WOULD HAVE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS TO DISCOVER THE DISEASES THAT ARE NEUROLOGICAL. WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF THE GREATEST TIME TO BE ALIVE, IS WHAT I BELIEVE. WE HAVE TO START ACTING LIKE WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, TO FIX A FEW BIG CONFLICTS THINGS IN ORDER TO RISE UP AGAIN -- BIG, COMPLEX THINGS IN ORDER TO RISE UP AGAIN. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE PEOPLE FEED YOUR ANGER OR ANGST. THERE IS A LEGITIMATE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. LOOK AT WASHINGTON DC. I MADE A MISTAKE, I WAS ASKED ON A SPORTS TALK SHOW. I WAS ASKED MY VIEWS ON THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS. I SAID, THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG PRESSING PROBLEMS HERE, I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO BE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT, TO TRY TO, THROUGH GOVERNMENT TAKE THE NAME OFF. IF THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT, LEAVE THEM ALONE. LET'S WORRY ABOUT THE COMPLICATED NATURE OF TAXES. THEY LEFT WENT CRAZY, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT THESE DAYS. SOMEONE SENT ME AN E-MAIL AND SAID JEB, THE TERM REDSKINS IS NOT PEJORATIVE, IT IS WASHINGTON. IF THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR NAME -- [APPLAUSE] I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IT, NORTHERN VIRGINIA REDSKINS. WASHINGTON IS BROKEN. IT IS RIDICULOUS, WE HAVE THREE DAY WORK WEEKS. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE DECIDE THEY'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE A WEEK OFF OR NOT SHOW UP AT A COMMITTEE HEARING. OR NOT GUARD -- VOTE. YOU WOULD HAVE A DEDUCTION IN PAY. WASHINGTON SHOULD HAVE THAT AS WELL. ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD SERVICE WITH A SERVANT'S PART. -- HEART. THEY SHOULD BE DOING THEIR WORK. ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD NOT FINISH THEIR JOB AND GO OUT THE BACK DOOR AND LOBBY THE PEOPLE THEY WERE SERVING WITH. THERE SHOULD BE A SIX-YEAR ON LOBBYIST. JUST AS THERE IS IN MANY PLACES. THERE ARE 29 STATES THAT HAVE ADVOCATED A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT. I HOPE WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE ONE. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN WASHINGTON, BUT THE STATE THAT PEOPLE CAN DEMAND THIS. GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS, RATHER THAN THEIR MEANS. IF WE FOCUSED ON BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO FORCE CONSENSUS ON HOW WE GET TO A BALANCED BUDGET WITH THAT CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT, I GUARANTEE IF I WAS PRESIDENT, WE COULD DO IT. WE NEED A LINE ITEM VETO POWER FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT. THEY CALL ME VETO CORLEONE WHEN I WAS THE GOVERNOR. I GUESS THAT WAS BEING -- LIKE BEING CALLED THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE CALLED ME BACK, I EMBRACED IT. 2500 SEPARATE LINE ITEMS IN THE BUDGET, NOT TO BE PUNITIVE. NOT TO SAY YOU ARE NOT ON MY TEAM AND I'M SENDING YOU A SIGNAL. SIMPLY BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT IF SPENDING DOES NOT GO THROUGH THE PROPER PROCESS, IT SHOULD NOT EXIST. A LIMITING THE PORK, WHAT WE CALL TURKEYS IN FLORIDA, WAS A WAY THAT WE PROVED THAT GOVERNMENT INCOME NEEDED TO GROW SLOWER THAN PERSONAL INCOME. I TURNED THE WHOLE STATE AND SYSTEM, TALLAHASSEE UPSIDE DOWN WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR. THE RESULT WAS, OVER EIGHT YEARS WE CUT TAXES EVERY YEAR, TOTALING $19 BILLION. WE REDUCED THE STATE GOVERNMENTS WORKFORCE BY 11%. 13,000 FEWER GOVERNMENT WORKERS. WE CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM OF EMPLOYMENT. THERE IS NO MORE LIFETIME CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT IN STATE GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN FIRE SOMEONE FOR INCOMPETENCE, OR FOR CAUSING FLORIDA -- FOR CAUSE IN FLORIDA. [APPLAUSE] THIS WAS NOT BEING PUNITIVE, THIS WAS BASED ON GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THE SERVANT, NOT MASTER. IN WASHINGTON DC, THEY HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THIS. THINK ABOUT THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, JIM. THINK ABOUT IS GOING ON THERE. YOU HAVE A SYSTEM OF BONE MISSING EXECUTIVES INSIDE THE V.A. -- BOONUSING THE EXECUTIVES INSIDE OF THE A. THEY WERE GOING TO BE GIVEN A BONUS FOR THE WAIT LIST, THEY FORGOT TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THE VETERANS. THEY REDUCED THE WAITING LIST BY TAKING THEM OFF OF THE LIST, SOME VETERANS DIED. DO YOU THINK PEOPLE GET FIRED? THREE PEOPLE GOT FIRED. DO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WORK THERE -- 330,000. THE SHEER INCOMPETENCE BECAUSE OF THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW IS IMPAIRING OUR ABILITY TO FIX PROBLEMS. PEOPLE ARE ANGRY FOR A GOOD REASON. THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE GOING TO STAY ANGRY, OR FIX IT? I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. I DID EXACTLY THE SICK -- THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE WASHINGTON DO IN TALLAHASSEE. THE RESULTS, WE WERE ONE OF TWO STATES TO GO TO AAA BOND RATING. THE UNITED STATES HAS HAD A DOWNGRADE TO AA. IT IS NOT THE REFLECTION OF THE GREATNESS OF OUR COUNTRY WHEN YOU SEE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S WATCH THERE WILL BE MORE DEBT ACUTE RELATED THAN ALL OF THE 43 PRESIDENTS PRIOR. TO RESTORE AMERICA'S GREATNESS -- WHICH WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF DOING, WE HAVE TO BRING BACK VETO CORLEONE FROM FLORIDA, TO WASHINGTON DC. WE NEED TO BRING BACK THE PHENOMENAL FACT THAT GOVERNMENT IS THE SERVANT, NOT MASTER. WE ARE THE HOST, THEY ARE THE PARASITE. IF WE GET SICK, THE PARASITE DIES AS WELL. YOU CANNOT CREATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THROUGH GOVERNMENT. IF YOU LISTEN TO LAST NIGHT TO THE DEBATE, YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT ALL POWER RESIDES IN WASHINGTON. ALL FORMS OF REGULATION CREATE PROSPERITY. TAXES MAKE IT BETTER. MORE SPENDING THROUGH WASHINGTON MAKE THINGS BETTER. HERE IS THE DEAL, WORKFORCE TO HIS PATIENT ARE LOWER THAN THEY WERE IN 1977. BECAUSE OF OBAMA PRINCIPALLY, 6.5 MILLION PEOPLE MORE ARE WORKING PART-TIME. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. WE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT -- THEY TALK ABOUT 6%, THE FACT IS IT IS DOUBLE-DIGIT. INCOME TODAY IS LOWER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A RECOVERY -- $2000 LOWER IN DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR FAMILIES. 6 MILLION MORE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN PARTY. WHO IS FOOLING WHO? THE PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL AGENDA HAS FAILED US. NOW WE HAVE TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE OF REFORMING TAXES, SIGNIFYING CODE, SHIFTING POWER -- POWER BACK TO PEOPLE. PROMOTING THE BIGGER BUSINESSES THAT HAVE THE LOBBYIST AND ALL OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS IN WASHINGTON THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO SURVIVE, BUT MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE DURATION -- GENERATION OF JOB GREATEST TO EXIST. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY, MORE BUSINESSES ARE BEING CLOSED INFORMED. -- THEN FORMED. IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE ADVOCATED ALL POWER TO WASHINGTON DC. THE JOB OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS TO LIFT EUROPE BY FIXING HOW A TAX. -- WE TAX. MAKING GOVERNMENT WORK AS A SERVANT. FIXING OUR ENTITLEMENT PROBLEMS THAT WILL OVERWHELM THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEOPLE, AND THE TEXT -- NEXT GENERATION. THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE, BUT IF WE FIX AND GROW AT 4% RATHER THAN 2%, PEOPLE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO DREAMS AGAIN. GUESS WHAT -- THE INTERACTION OF PEOPLE, ALL OF US TOGETHER IN A DYNAMIC COUNTRY, FREE OF GOVERNMENT MANDATES AND RULES AND TAXES, THE WAY WE HAVE IT TODAY WILL HAVE -- CREATE MORE THINGS THAT WILL MOVE OUR HEART AND DRIVE US FORWARD. WE WILL FIND CURES FOR DISEASES. WE WILL LEAD THE WORLD IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. I TRUST 300 MILLION PEOPLE IN A CRAZY FASHION, INTERACTING AMONGST OURSELVES IN TRIAL AND ERROR, THAN ANY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM EVER CREATED. I HOPE YOU DO AS WELL. IF WE GROW AT 4%, WHICH I BELIEVE WE DO, EMBRACING THE ENERGY REVOLUTION. FIXING OUR ENTITLEMENT PROBLEMS. BEING FRUGAL WITH GOVERNMENT SPENDING. CHALLENGING HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS, WE CAN GET THERE. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GROW AT 4% UNLESS WE RECOGNIZE WE ARE LIVING IN A PERILOUS WORD -- WORLD. EACH DAY ANOTHER STORY COMES OUT TO PROVE IT IS PERILOUS. IT IS PERILOUS BECAUSE WE HAVE ABDICATED ARE RESPONSIBLE IT IS AS A WORLD LEADER. THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD. WITH ALL RESPECT TO HIM, HE IS DEAD WRONG. THIS COUNTRY LEADS. WHEN WE LEAVE WE CREATE A BETTER CHANCE FOR PEACE AND SECURITY. IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, HERE IS THE DEAL -- WE WILL REBUILD THE MILITARY, TREAT OUR TROOPS WITH RESPECT. WE WILL ARM THEM. [APPLAUSE] THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS NOT TO DUTY STRAWMAN THING THAT BARACK OBAMA SAYS, IF YOU'RE NOT FOR HIS NUANCED SOPHISTICATED VIEW, YOU ARE A WARMONGER, THAT IS NOT TRUE. LEADERSHIP MEANS -- WE ARE NOT THE WORLD POLICEMAN, BUT WE HAVE TO LEAD. PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THEIR BACK. IMAGINE BEING THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL RIGHT NOW, UNDER ATTACK BY ORGANIZED EFFORT BY PALESTINIANS TO TRY TO DESTABILIZE JERUSALEM. WHERE THOMAS IS DEALING ITS OATS AGAIN IN THE GAZA STRIP. WITHOUT AN ALLY -- THE I HAVE YOUR BACK KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WE SHOULD HAVE FOR ISRAEL, WE ARE CASTING THEM ASIDE IN ALLIANCE -- IN THEIR MINDS. THEY WILL TAKE ACTION, AS ANY COUNTRY WILL. WE SHOULD HAVE THEIR BACK. THERE SHOULD BE WHEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] FRANKLY -- ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS NEED TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THEIR BACK. OUR ENEMIES NEED TO FEAR US. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY, WHAT WE -- WON'T WE CREATE A PROBLEM IF WE PUSH BACK ON WHAT AMERICA WOULDN'T'S ACTION -- PUTIN'S ACTIONS IN SYRIA? THEY ARE NOW ACTIVELY PROMOTING AND SUPPORTING THE BRUTALITY OF THE ASSAD REGIME. THIS AFTERNOON I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT A CUBAN GENERAL NOW IS PLAYING A PART. THEY ARE RE-CREATING THIS ACCESS OF OPPONENTS TO THE UNITED STATES TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS. WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT OFFENDING PUTIN? HE IS A BULLY. HE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT OFFENDING US, NOT THE OTHER WAY. WE NEED TO STAND STRONG AND TALL. THAT MEANS WE WILL CREATE MORE SECURITY. TODAY IN SYRIA, MILLIONS ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY. 200,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED. THERE ARE REFUGEES FORCED BACK THERE THAT WILL EITHER BE RAPED, HELD AS SLAVES, OR KILLED. THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO LEAD. IF WE STAND FOR ANYTHING, IT IS THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE. TODAY PEOPLE WONDER WHERE THE UNITED STATES IS. THE VOID IS BEING FILLED IN A WAY THAT WILL CREATE PROBLEMS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. WE HAVE TO BE ENGAGED IN THE WORLD. OUR FRIENDS NEED TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THEIR BACK. OUR ENEMIES AND NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO ADJUST TO THE REALITY THAT AMERICA WILL BE THERE FOR A LONG WHILE. WE NEED TO RESTORE INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES. WE NEED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MILITARY TROOPS. WE NEED TO DO IT IN A LOUD AND CLEAR WAY. IF YOU WANT TO GET TO PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, YOU HAVE TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD. THAT GETS US BACK ON TRACK TO CREATING HIGH SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIFTED UP. [APPLAUSE] THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU IS, LOOK, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE BIG PERSONALITIES ON THE STAGE. IT REALLY IS NOT. IT IS NOT ABOUT ANYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, ALL 75 OF US. [LAUGHTER] IT REALLY IS AN. -- IS NOT. IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE YOU SINGLE MOMS I MEET ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE A CHILD IN A FAILING SCHOOL. THEY WANT TO GO TO A HIGH-PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL. WHAT A VOUCHER TO GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL TO AFFORD THE SAME THINGS THAT PEOPLE OF AFFLUENCE HAVE. IT SHOULD BE A RIGHT FOR EVERY MOM AND DAD TO PICK THE SCHOOL THAT BEST MEETS THE NEED OF THEIR CHILD. [APPLAUSE] IT SHOULD BE. IT IS ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN, HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM THAT I MET IN DENVER, THEY HAVE A COMPANY OF FOUR PEOPLE THEY WERE -- THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE ABOUT TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. THE CONFUSION THIS BRINGS FOR THEIR OWN BUSINESS. IT IS ABOUT THE MILITARY FAMILY WONDERING WHETHER THE LEAVE -- WHETHER THEY'RE LEFT ONE IS GOING TO COME BACK HOME. OR THEIR STATE WILL HAVE TO BE EXTENDED BECAUSE WE GOT AT THE MILITARY FORCE. WE SHRUNK IT ANYTIME WE NEED TO REBUILD IT. IT IS ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ONE OR TWO PAYCHECKS AWAY FROM UTTER DISASTER. IT IS ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE I MET IN 1998, AT THE TIME WE WERE NOT FRIENDS, SHE LET ME HAVE IT IN A TOWN MEETING. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN TODAY. SHE LET ME HAVE IT. SHE TOLD ME I DID NOT CARE ABOUT FAMILIES WITH KIDS WITH DEVELOPMENT OF DISABILITIES. I COULD NOT CONVINCE HER, SO I SAID, I TELL YOU WHAT, IN THE NEXT MONTH I WILL GIVE YOU FOUR DAYS. YOU CAN SCHEDULE MY LIFE AND TEACH ME. I WANT TO LISTEN FIRST. I WANT TO HEAR WHAT IT IS LIKE. WHAT SHE TOLD ME WAS, THE GREATEST FEAR THAT SHE AND MILTON HAVE IS WHETHER THEY WILL OUTLIVE WE SEE -- LUCY. I LEARNED A LOT IN THOSE FOUR DAYS. I WENT TO THOSE GROUP HOMES AND I SAW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO HAVE THE DIGNITY OF AN INDEPENDENT LIFE. I WOULD TO WORK PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOP AN OLD DISABILITY FOR GETTING JOBS. CUSTOMERS LOVED IT. EMPLOYEE FOUND TO -- JOIN. --JOY. EVERYONE HAS VALUE. EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE. THEY LEFT BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE ARE LIABILITIES THAT THEY NEED TO MANAGE FROM ABOVE. WE BELIEVE IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HAS A GOD-GIVEN ABILITY TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. ALL OF OUR POLICY SHOULD BE ORGANIZED AROUND THAT. THAT IS WHAT I LEARNED. NOW SHE WAS AN INDEPENDENT, HER HUSBAND WAS A DEMOCRAT, THEY ARE MY STRONGEST SUPPORTERS BECAUSE WE CHANGED THE SYSTEM. 30,000 FAMILIES IN FLORIDA RECEIVE BENEFITS FOR THEIR LOVED ONE. 30,000 MORE FAMILIES TODAY DO NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY WILL OUTLIVE HER CHILD -- THEIR CHILD. [APPLAUSE] LISTENING AND LEARNING IS IMPORTANT. I WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET ALL MY LIFE JOURNEY THAT JUST WANT TO BE LIFTED UP. THEY WANT A CHANCE TO LIVE A LIFE OF PURPOSE A MEETING -- MEETING. PEOPLE LIKE MR. MERIWETHER. SHE USED TO BE LARGEST VOUCHER PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. NOW ABOUT 70,000 KIDS GET A PRIVATE SCHOOL INDIRECTLY WITH PUBLIC MONEY. WHEN SHE WAS IN THIRD GRADE -- HE IS NOW 25 YEARS OLD, SHE WITHHELD BACK. -- SHE WAS HELD BACK. HER OLDER BROTHER HAD A RUN-IN WITH THE LAW. HER MOTHER WAS LOST. SHE WAS ANGRY. NO ONE EVER TOLD HER SHE WAS SMART AND CAPABLE OF LEARNING. SHE WAS EFFECTIVELY -- LIKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS, BEING CAST ASIDE. BECAUSE WE CHALLENGE THE ORTHODOXY OF OUR TIMES AND CREATED THE FIRST STATEWIDE VOUCHER PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. ONE OF THOSE IS THIS PROGRAM. HER GODMOTHER FOUND OUT ABOUT IT, AND SHE GOT TO GO A CHRISTIAN SCHOOL. IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL, JUST FOR THE RECORD. WHEN SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS CAPABLE OF LEARNING, WHEN SHE WAS TOLD SHE WAS AN ASSET RATHER THAN A LIABILITY, WHEN TO ITS ULTIMATE PURPOSE IN LIFE AND THAT SHE WAS LOVED, SHE ACCELERATED HER LEARNING TO TAKE BACK THE THIRD GRADE, AND SHE DID IT AGAIN. SHE WAS THE FIRST IN HER FAMILY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. SHE WAS THE FIRST IN HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. THERE ARE 250,000 CHILDREN IN FLORIDA THAT ARE GRADE LEVEL READERS. I CHALLENGED EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WORKED. I TOOK ON THE TWO -- TEACHERS UNION. DO YOU SEE THE SCARS ON MY HEAD. I THOUGHT, WE WANT. -- WE WON. WE OPENED THE SYSTEM. KIDS LIKE HER, I DON'T KNOW SHE'S A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER. SHE NOW HAS A CHANCE TO RISE UP. IMAGINE A COUNTRY THAT FOCUSES ON THE FACT THAT ALL OF US ARE ASSETS. HOW DO WE ACHIEVE SUCCESS. THE WHOLE FOCUS OUGHT TO BE UNWITTING PEOPLE UP -- LIFTING PEOPLE UP. IF YOU RUN A CAMPAIGN OF RIGHT WAY, AND YOU HAVE A PRINCIPAL CENTERED LEADER THAT KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS THING, THIS WILL BE THE MOST EXTREME MARRY LIVE -- TIME TO BE ALIVE IN THIS WORLD. I BELIEVE THAT MY HEART, I HOPE YOU ALL DO AS WELL. I HUMBLY ASKED FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND VOTE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIMARY THAT EXIST IN THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] YES SIR. I HAVE NOT SEEN A MICHELE BACHMANN T-SHIRT IN A WHILE. >> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR BUSH, PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE. THE QUESTION I WANT TO SQ IS ABOUT THE OTHER STATE -- TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS THE OTHER STATE, IOWA, I AM ASKING BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE CONSTITUTION. HODGES, WEAVER, JONES, THOSE LAWS DENY A PERSON THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND A MISDEMEANOR TRIAL. THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM OR DEFEND THEMSELVES. JEB BUSH: THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT VIOLATES THE BILL OF RIGHTS. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU WHERE YOU STAND ON THAT. JEB BUSH: WITHOUT KNOWING THE SPECIFICS, THE BILL OF RIGHTS TRUMPS STATE LAW, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. WHETHER IT IS THE SECOND OPINION -- AMENDMENT AND YOU HAVE STATES TRYING TO OVERREACH AND RESTRICT GUN RIGHTS TO LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. NORMALLY THAT IS SETTLED IN THE FEDERAL COURT. I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS. THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- I WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION CENTER FOR A FEW YEARS. I HAD A CHANCE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THE CONSTITUTION AGAIN. NORMALLY YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT IT AS A KID, IT IS DIFFERENT, KIND OF INTERESTING. YOU DO NOT REALIZE THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUTION. IT PLAYS OUT IN OUR LIVES EACH OF EVERYDAY -- AND EVERY DAY. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BLUEPRINT FOR A FREE SOCIETY. WE MAY BE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS A SET OF RIGHTS TO PROTECT US FROM OUR GOVERNMENT. IT IS POWERFUL. AS LONG AS WE ARE SELF-GOVERNING, THIS DOCUMENT WILL KEEP US FREE AND MAINTAIN THE GREATNESS OF THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE WILL RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF INNOVATING AND PURSUING THEIR LIVES IN A FREE SOCIETY. I CANNOT TELL YOU SPECIFICS OF THE IOWA LAWS. IT HAS NEVER COME UP. I WILL HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT IT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. MIKE IS COMING YOUR WAY. >> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. JEB BUSH: WHEN YOU MAKE IT ONE QUESTION, TWO-PARTS. >> OK, TO INCREASE THE MILITARY, HOW DO WE FIND THAT --FUND THAT? HOWDY FEEL ABOUT REFUGEES FROM SYRIA IN THE UNITED STATES? JEB BUSH: THE FIRST RESPONSE ABILITY OF OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IS NATIONAL DEFENSE. IF YOU HAD TO PICK THE ONE THING FOR THEM TO DO, WHAT WOULD IT BE? I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE CARRYING THE MAIL. I DON'T THINK OF THE AMTRAK. I THINK IT WOULD BE PROTECTING OUR SHORES. THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS, WHETHER YOU HAVE IT OR NOT, LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A ZERO-BASED BUDGETING. THAT IS THE WAY YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT, AS A LEADER. I WOULD FUND THE FIRST PRIORITY FIRST. I WOULD CHALLENGE THE ORTHODOXIES OF EVERYTHING -- OTHER THINGS. THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IS TO BE CHALLENGED, JUST AS MUCH OF THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. THE V.A. HAS A HOSPITAL THEY STARTED IT $3 MILLION. NOW THEY HAVE $1.8 BILLION. YOU CANNOT MAKE THAT UP. I'LL THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATE WOULD ALLOW A GOVERNOR TO RUN AWAY WITH THAT KIND OF SPENDING. THERE WOULD BE OVERSIGHT. IN WASHINGTON IT IS KIND OF OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND I GUESS. WE CAN REFORM THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. THE MILITARY PROGRAMS THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING ARE EXTREMELY COSTLY, THEY TAKE TOO LONG. THERE IS A LOT OF CHALLENGING TO SAVE MONEY. FEASIBLE FACT IS WE ARE GETTING THE FORCE LEVELS THAT WILL PUT US IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION -- GUTTING THE FORCE LEVELS THAT WILL PUT US IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION. WE ALSO HAVE TO GROW THE ECONOMY AT A FASTER RATE. IF YOU GROW IT AT 4%, IT BRINGS IN REVENUE MORE THAN EXOTIC FORMS OF TAXATION THE LEFT PROPOSES. LAST NIGHT, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE IS KEEPING A METER ON THE PROMISES OF TAXES RAISED OF SPENDING AND -- SPENT. BERNIE SANDERS HAS PROPOSED $18 TRILLION IN SPENDING. HE IS WARMING UP. GROWING THE ECONOMY WILL CREATE MORE REVENUE THAN PEOPLE IMAGINE. YOU GET THE DENOMINATOR GROWING, THE NUMERATOR DOES NOT LOOK AS BAD. YOU DEAL WITH THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS ON THAT SIDE. AS A RELATES TO SYRIA, HERE IS THE DEAL. THE FIRST PRIORITY FOR OUR COUNTRY IS TO CREATE A STRATEGY TO TAKE OUT ISIS AND ASSAD. THAT SHOULD BE THE FIRST STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH REFUGEES. [APPLAUSE] I PROPOSED ONE. I WENT TO THE REAGAN LIBRARY AND PROPOSED IT. I'VE PROPOSED A NO-FLY ZONE. IF ASSAD WAS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BEAR UPON THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN HIS COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES COULD DESTROY HIS AIR FORCE AND THE ABILITY TO LAND PLANES. THAT WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM LIKE THAT. NOW IT IS MORE COMPLICATED WITH RUSSIA. WE NEED TO LEAVE THE ROLE -- WORLD. THERE SHOULD BE ONE ARMY, THE REMNANTS OF THE SYRIAN FREE ARMY THAT WE HAVE PROMISED TO HELP AND AVOIDED. ALL OF THIS WE NEED TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME AND CREATE A UNIFIED EFFORT, WITH SAISON'S -- SAFE ZONES TO DEAL WITH THIS CHALLENGE. IF YOU SAW A EARLY THIS WEEK OR LATE LAST WEEK, ISIS IS NOW -- IT LOOKS LIKE ISIS HAS KILLED MORE THAN SCORES OF PEOPLE IN TURKEY. THIS IS SPILLING OUT INTO THE REGION. THE REGION NEEDS TO BE ENGAGED. TURKEY, JORDAN, THEY HAVE MILLIONS IN REFUGEE CAMPS IN THESE COUNTRIES. WE NEED THE PERSIAN GULF COUNTRIES INVOLVED. THEY SHOULD BE FINANCING A MAJORITY OF THIS. WE NEED TO HAVE FORMER AIR CONTROLLERS AND PEOPLE WHO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO LAUNCH THESE. WE NEED TO TELL LAWYERS TO TAKE A STEP BACK. THIS IS PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THE REFUGEE PROBLEM IS TO DEAL WITH THE SOURCE OF WHY WE HAVE IT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE SCREENED, BUT WE SHOULD DISSIPATE IN THAT AS WELL -- PARTICIPATE IN THAT AS WELL. I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD ABANDON THE CORE VALUES, THE GOODNESS OF OUR COUNTRY. I DO NOT THINK WE'RE THAT SMALL. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE INTERNAL PROBLEMS, FOR SURE. I GET THAT. WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS BEING PROPOSED -- IF THE OPTION IS MURDER, RAPE, BEHEADINGS, THAT IS THE OPTION FOR MANY OF THESE PEOPLE, WE SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN THAT AS WELL. WE SHOULD BE LEADING THE WORLD TO ERADICATE THESE PROBLEMS THE COST THIS. -- CAUSED THIS. GERMANY IS EXCEPTING 8000 REFUGEES. THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM, TO USE A TERM THAT OTHER CANDIDATES USE. THOSE PROBLEMS WILL PLAY OUT UNLESS THEY GET ENGAGED TO HELP CREATE A MORE STABLE SYRIA AS WELL. YES SIR. >> I DON'T KNOW I HAVE A NEED TO SAY THIS. YOUR BROTHER MADE A LOT OF DIFFICULT DECISIONS. BY AND LARGE I DID NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THEM, BUT I THINK HE WAS A GREAT PRESIDENT. JEB BUSH: YOU CAN SAY THAT ALL OF YOU WANT -- ALL YOU WANT. >> AS IT RELATES. JEB BUSH: HE IS A MIGHTY FINE BROTHER. >> WE KNOW THAT IF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER'S DECISIONS RELATED TO IRAQ, PROBABLY WE WOULD NOT BE IN THIS MESS TODAY. ONE QUESTION, TWO-PARTS. WHERE DO YOU DIFFER FROM YOUR BROTHER? THE OTHER QUESTION IS RELATED TO EDUCATION -- MOST REPUBLICANS PREFER TO HAVE EDUCATIONAL DECISION-MAKING DEVOLVED TO THE STATES. YOU ARE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF COMMON CORE -- THAT LEADS TO A LOT OF DECISIONS IN WASHINGTON. JEB BUSH: WHERE I DIFFER FOR MY BROTHER, I AM TALLER, AND YOUNGER. PROBABLY NOT AS SMART. THE CONTEXT FOR PRESIDENTS ARE ALWAYS DIFFERENT. MY DAD WAS PRESIDENT IN 1990 -- 9089. THE YEAR 2000 WAS DIFFERENT. THE DIFFERENCE IN MY BROTHER'S ADMINISTRATION WAS, WE GOT ATTACKED. HE BECAME A WARTIME PRESIDENT. I THINK HE DID NEXT REMARRIED JOB KEEPING US SAFE -- I THINK HE DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB KEEPING US SAFE. [APPLAUSE] AS A RESULT, THE OTHER AREAS WHERE A PRESIDENT CAN PUT PRESSURE ON CONGRESS NOT TO SPEND, AND CREATE DISCIPLINE PROBABLY SUBSIDED. HE WAS FOCUSED, AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF IN THE GREATEST FIGHTING FORCE EVER ASSEMBLED. I AM NOT FAULTING HIM, I AM JUST SAYING THAT YOU CAN CHECK MY RECORD AS GOVERNOR. CUT TAXES EVERY YEAR. $19 BILLION. JOHN STOSSEL HAS DONE A REPORT WHICH I LIKE BECAUSE IT MADE ME LOOK THE BEST OF ALL GOVERNORS RUNNING. WE CUT SPENDING MORE THAN ANY OF THE GOVERNORS RUNNING. IT HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FOR THE TIMES IN WHICH WE WERE SERVING AND POPULATION GROWTH. ON MY -- ON A PER CAPITA BASIS WE CUT SPENDING. WHEN I LEFT THERE WAS A 35% GENERAL REVENUE RESERVE. WHO KNOWS, WE MIGHT OF HAD EIGHT HURRICANES HIT US. THESE THINGS MATTER. I WAS A COMMITTED CONSERVATIVE ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THAT IS WHAT I WOULD BE AS PRESIDENT. AS GOVERNOR, I WANTED ALL OF THE AUTHORITY ON EDUCATION. I WOULD'VE TAKEN A LUMP SUM FROM WASHINGTON DC. GIVE ME THE TITLE I MONEY, THAT IS FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE LOW PERFORMING. GIVING -- GIVE ME THE ID A MONEY. GIVE ME ALL OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD LITERACY MONEY. THERE ARE 30 PROGRAMS FOR PRE-K. LUMP THEM TOGETHER, GIVE ME MY PERCENTAGE, GIVE ME THE OUTCOME YOU WANT AND LEAVE ME ALONE. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD'VE WANTED. 80% OF THE BUREAUCRATS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN TALLAHASSEE WERE THERE TO FILL OUT FORMS FOR THE 10% OF THE MONEY THAT WE GOT FROM WASHINGTON DC. I DO NOT BELIEVE COMMON CORE OR HIGHER STANDARDS. IF THE STATES WANT TO HAVE THEM COME A GREAT. IF THEY WANT DIFFERENT STANDARDS, FINE. MAKE THEM HIGH. THE IDEA THEY ARE COMMON IS FINE. [APPLAUSE] WE HAD THE GREATESTGAINS AND LEARNING IN ANY STATE. I AM NOT PRONE TO EXAGGERATION. COMPARED TO OTHERS AT LEAST. THE GREATEST GAINS IN LEARNING HAPPEN BECAUSE WE RAISE STANDARDS, HAD REAL ACCOUNTABILITY, RATED SCHOOLS A-F. EVERY MOM AND DAD KNEW THAT AN F WAS NOT AS GOOD AS IN A. PARENTS WERE GIVEN VOUCHERS WHEN THEIR STUDENT GOT A F TO GO TO A HIGH-PERFORMING SCHOOL. WE GOT RID OF THE INSIDIOUS IDEA THAT IF YOU ARE IN FOURTH GRADE AND YOU DON'T READ, THERE IS GOING TO BE DIVINE INTERVENTION TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DAY. YOU CANNOT DO SCIENCE AND MATH IF YOU CANNOT READ. ALL OF THAT WITH STATE DRIVEN, THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. THERE SHOULD BE NO FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE CREATION OF STANDARDS, CONTENT, OR CURRICULUM. [APPLAUSE] IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T REAUTHORIZE THE K-12 LAW, WHICH THEY ARE ABOUT READY TO DO. THIS IS MAYBE THE ONE THING THE REPUBLICANS DO WHICH WILL PUT A LID ON THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. I WILL DO IT BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. THIS IS IMPORTANT. CAN WE GET TO THE BIGGER CONVERSATION, WHICH IS A THIRD OF OUR KIDS ARE COLLEGE OR CAREER READY. WHO THINKS THAT IS GOOD? THINK OF THE SHATTERED LIVES THAT END WITH THAT RESULT? THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. WE HAVE DUMBED IT DOWN WHERE EVERYONE IS ABOVE AVERAGE. NOW WE ARE THREATENED WITH LOWERING STANDARDS TO GET INTO COLLEGE. LOWERING THE CONTENT FOR READING AND MATH. YOU'RE BASICALLY REDOING HIGH SCHOOL MATH AND READING AT COLLEGE LEVEL. WE ARE PUTTING STUDENT LOANS ON TOP OF THE BACKS OF STUDENTS WHO CANNOT GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS LIFE OR YOUR DEGREE. THAT IS THE PATH WE ARE ON. TO REVERSE THAT WE NEED HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND ZERO TOLERANCE FOR THE ATTITUDE THAT SOME KIDS CAN LEARN AND SOME CANNOT. IN FLORIDA WE PROVED THAT OTHERWISE. TO PUT IT INTO PERSPECTIVE, WE WERE 50TH OUT OF 50 IN GRADUATION RATE. THAT'S BAD. ONE WOULD BE GOOD. >> MY MATH IS BAD. JEB BUSH: WE COULD NOT EVEN WHISPER -- THANK GOD FOR YOUR FAVORITE STATE. THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE STATE LED IN DRIVEN. -- AND DRIVEN. YES THERE, IN THE BACK. IT IS DARK BACK THERE. >> FOLLOWING IN THE SAME VEIN OF EDUCATION, AS A COLLEGE STUDENT I WAS LISTENING TO THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT. BERNIE SANDERS SAID HE WANTS FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION. HILLARY CLINTON WAS LOWER INTEREST RATES. HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THE ISSUE? JEB BUSH: LET ME GIVE YOU GOOD NEWS OF YOUR CHILDREN IN FLORIDA. IN-STATE FLORIDA STUDENTS HAVE THE LOWEST TUITION. OF ANY STATE IN THE EYES STATES -- IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT IS MERIT-BASED. ANY PERSON WITH A GPA OF X ANS S AT OF Y GIVE A FULL RIDE. YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THE OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS. WE PUT A CAP ON TUITION. WE STARTED IT, BUT IT HAS BEEN ENHANCED OR MEDICALLY UNDER GOVERNOR SCOTT, WE NOW HAVE A -- DRAMATICALLY UNDER GOVERNOR SCOTT, WE NOW HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE SCHOOLS ARE MEASURED ON OUTCOMES. THEY HAVE TO PRODUCE WHAT WE EXPECT THEM TO. [APPLAUSE] WE MEASURE -- DECREE -- DEGREE COMPLETION FOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES -- WE MEASURE IT IN SIX YEARS. WHAT A WEEK HOLIDAY SIX YOUR DEGREE -- WHY DON'T WE CALL IT A SIX-YEAR DEGREE? I WORKED. I WAS MOTIVATED. I WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE OF 42 YEARS NOW. I WANTED TO GET GOING WITH MY LIFE. I DON'T KNOW WHY KIDS ARE LUCKY LIKE I WAS. YOU CAN GRADUATE AND WORK. 18 HOURS, THAT WOULD BE A BIG LOAD FOR COLLEGE. YOU CANNOT GET THAT IN MANY SCHOOLS BECAUSE PROFESSORS DO NOT TEACH THE SAME WAY THEY MIGHT HAVE IN THE PAST. ASSUME FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU ACTUALLY STUDIED AN HOUR FOR EVERY HOUR YOU TOOK. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT, IN MY CASE, MAYBE I DID. YOU'RE UP TO 30'S HOURS -- 36 HOURS. I DON'T REMEMBER IN MY ADULT LIFE WORKING LESS THAN 36 HOURS ANY WEEK SINCE 21 YEARS OLD. THIS IS LUDICROUS, TO TELL A 21-YEAR-OLD KID OR IN 18-YEAR-OLD KID THAT THEY CANNOT DO MORE THAN THERE BEING TOLD TO DO. IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY ON STUDENT LOANS, GET THEM THROUGH FASTER. MAKE SURE THERE IS REALLY COUNT ABILITY. -- REAL ACOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE A POOL OF MONEY IN FLORIDA, IF YOU HAVE DEGREE COMPLETION RATE THAT DO NOT MEET THE OBJECTIVE, YOU GET MONEY TAKEN AWAY. THE SCHOOLS THAT YOU BETTER GET MONEY GIVEN TO THEM. NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE EVERYONE IS COMPETING TO DO THE THINGS WE WANT MORE OF. THAT IS NOT CITE MAJORS, BUT MAJORS IN DEGREES THAT CAN ACTUALLY GIVE SOMEONE A JOB. DOING IT IN FOUR YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX. WITH THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND TUITION SUPPORT CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS PROBABLY THE BEST DEAL PEOPLE WILL GET IN FLORIDA WHETHER IT IS COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR HIGHER EDUCATION. THERE IS A LOT OF THOSE IDEAS THAT EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET OUT OF THE WAY AND BE A PARTNER FOR INNOVATION FROM THE BOTTOM UP. [APPLAUSE] ACROSS THE SPECTRUM A POLICY. THE GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON IS JUST NOT DESIGNED TO COME UP WITH A CREATIVE IDEA. IMPULSES TO TAKE POWER AWAY. AS YOU TAKE POWER AWAY, YOU TAKE AWAY THE INNOVATIVE SPIRIT. DESPITE THE GOOD INTENTIONS, AND OVER 50 STATES NEVER WORKS COMPARED TO TRYING A FLORIDA WAY. NO -- KNOW INSTINCTIVELY, WHATEVER SUBJECT MATTER COMES UP, I DEFAULT TO SHIFTING POWER BACK TO STATES, RATHER THAN HAVE THE GOVERNMENT BE THE END-ALL BE-ALL. FOCUS ON PRIORITIES, KEEP US SAFE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NATIONWIDE. THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER FOR OUR SAFETY AND GROWTH. THAT IS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK ON. [APPLAUSE] YES, MA'AM. >> I HAVE A QUESTION. SHE IS WORRIED ABOUT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL RUN OUT. WITH ALL OF THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION COMING IN, IF WE BRING IN REFUGEES. IS THAT WHAT IT IS? >> I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT FOR A LONG TIME. JEB BUSH: I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT PROTECTING NATURAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE A DUTY, WE ARE THE DOMINANT SPECIES ON THE PLANET. OUR NATURE IS A GIFT FROM GOD. WE ARE CHILDREN OF GOD. I SIMPLIFY THIS. WE HAVE A DUTY. WE HAVE A DUTY OF CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION. THE GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA IS WE ARE A BIG, BIG COUNTRY. WE ARE FULL OF ABUNDANCE. WE CAN GROW OUR ECONOMY. WE CAN BE RESPECTFUL OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND FIND COMMON GROUND. I WILL RESORT TO MY EXPERIENCE IN FLORIDA. IN SORT OF WE HAVE THE LARGEST LAND PURCHASING PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. IT WAS CALLED FLORIDA FOREVER. IT WAS A BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS IN THE STATES THAT EVERY YEAR WE WOULD BUY $300 MILLION OF PRISTINE FLORIDA BEFORE GOT DEVELOPED. -- IT GOT DEVELOPED. BEFORE A DEVELOPER WOULD COME AND BUY IT AND PUT HOUSING ON IT. THIS WAS IN THE ECOSYSTEMS WE NEEDED TO PROTECT. FLORIDA IS DIFFERENT FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND THIS BEAUTIFUL STATE. OUR TREES DO NOT CHANGE COLORS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN MORE PEOPLE MOUNTAINS AND HILLS. [APPLAUSE] FLORIDA HAS GOOD THINGS GOING ON. IT ALSO HAS AN EXTREME NEARLY FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT. -- EXTREMELY FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT. WE HAD A DUTY TO PROTECT FLORIDA. THE WAY WE DID IT WAS TO GROW OUR ECONOMY. THAT PROVIDED RESOURCES. IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO SOUTH FLORIDA, THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE IT. I AM PROUD OF IT. IT IS A RESOURCE UNIQUE TO THE WORLD. IT HAS ALL SORTS OF FAUNA, CRITTERS, AND FISH THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED. IT IS ALSO OUR WATER SUPPLY. IT IS ANOTHER PLACE FOR YOU NEED TO SHARE THE RESOURCE AND DO IT IN A RESPECTFUL WAY. UNDER MY WATCH WE CLEANED UP THE EVERGLADES AND PROTECTED THE WATER RESOURCE FOR NATURE AND A GROWING POPULATION. I THINK THAT IS THE WAY YOU DO THIS. YOU DO IT RESPECTFUL OF NATURE, BUT YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE WE HAVE TO ALLOW PEOPLE -- I WORRY AS MUCH ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT GO ON. THE THING I WORRY ABOUT THE MOST IS HOW MUCH MONEY PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR POCKETS. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT MY REAR END. I AM WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE'S WHILE IT'S. --WALLETS. PEOPLE ARE REALLY STRUGGLING. HE SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING A LID ON PEOPLE'S ASPIRATIONS IN THAT REGARD. EVERYTHING I -- EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT HE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY, OR IN MY CASE WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR, I WAS ALSO MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE GROWING INCOME. LET IT RIP. >> I CAME FROM THE COAST. JEB BUSH: YOU ARE YIELDING A TIME? WELL DONE. >> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. JEB BUSH: WHAT IS YOUR MINISTRY? >> I AM A CHAPLAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW NAPSTER. TO MY LEFT IS THE ASSOCIATE CHAPLAIN AT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC STUDENT CENTER. JEB BUSH: I AM ON YOUR TEAM. >> WE ARE ALL CHILDREN OF GOD. JEB BUSH: THAT WAS A STUPID JOKE. >> I MAKE THEM ALL THE TIME. WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER YOU A SIMPLE PRAYER. LIKE YOU, WE ARE PRAYER -- PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE PRAY FOR OUR LEADERS TO EASE THE SUFFERING AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. >> WE PRAY FOR THE POOR AND VULNERABLE, THOSE MOST AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION. GOD OF ALL CREATION, HERE ARE PRAYER. >> FOR THOSE HARMED BY FRACKING, COAL MINING, NATURAL GAS PIPELINES AND OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING, GOD OF ALL CREATION, HEAR OUR PRAYER. >> TO PRAY FOR OUR LEADERS TO OPEN HER HEART TO CLIMATE JUSTICE, GOD OF ALL CREATION, HEAR OUR PRAYER. >> AS SOMEONE WHO DID GREAT THINGS IN FLORIDA, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU WOULD LEAD US FACING CLIMATE CHANGE0. JEB BUSH: I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE YIELD. THAT WAS AN ELEGANT WAY TO GET TO THE TASK AT HAND. THE ANSWER I GAVE APPLIES TO THIS ISSUE AS WELL. I THINK WE CAN SOLVE MORE PROBLEMS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING, WHEN PEOPLE'S INCOME IS GROWING. THE SOLUTION CANNOT BE TO HOLLOW OUT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. YOU COULD REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS, AND WE COULD INCREASINGLY MOVE TOWARDS POVERTY. I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE ANSWER FOR OUR COUNTRY. IN FACT, THAT IS KIND OF THE PATH WE ARE ON. DISPOSABLE INCOME IS NOW $2000 LOWER THAN IT WAS SIX YEARS AGO. IN A RECOVERY, THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. WE HAVE THESE BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGES GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD. SOME PEOPLE CAN WRITE THIS OFF THAT YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO IT. THIS IS THE END OF THE AMERICAN ERA, EXCEPT IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. HERE'S HOW I WOULD ANSWER QUESTION. -- YOUR QUESTION. I ANSWER IT AS A RESIDENT OF MIAMI. MY HOME IS PROBABLY 12 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. I AM ON A HIGH POINT IN OUR COMMUNITY. 12 IS ABOUT AS HIGH AS IT GETS. IF YOU HAVE RISING SEA LEVELS, RISING TIDES, IN A PLACE LIKE FLORIDA -- IT WAS NOT ENGINEERED AND DESIGNED FOR ANY KIND OF MAJOR INCREASE IN TIME. -- TIED. THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS IT THAT. WE HAVE TO CREATE POLICIES OF ADAPTATION. SECONDLY, THE PROPER ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT IN THIS IS, IN MY MIND IS TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON BASIC RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY THE NEXT STRUCT OF ENERGY RESOURCES THAT WILL BE COMPETITIVE WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS THAT WE USE NOW. YOU CAN BE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT IF YOU FOLLOW ENERGY POLICY IN OUR COUNTRY. NATURAL GAS, BECAUSE THE FRACKING AND HYDRAULIC DRILLING HAS HAD A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN RESERVES. THE PRICE HAS GONE DOWN FIVEFOLD. IT HAS GONE FROM DOUBLE DIGITS TO TWO DOLLARS A THOUSAND CUBIC FEET. IT HAS REDUCED CARBON EMISSIONS BY 10% IN THE LAST DECADE AS WE CONVERT FROM COAL AND OTHER HEAVIER SOURCES OF CARBON IS -- ENERGY. IT IS ALSO CHALLENGE THE OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY. SELLER HAS SEEN A DIRECT REDUCTION IN COSTS. BASELINE IS DROPPED. WIND IS COMPETITIVE TODAY. IN A PLACE LIKE IOWA, WHERE YOU HAVE AMPLE WIND, CONSISTENT WIND , YOU KNOW HAVE WIND BEING BUILT WITHOUT ANY SUBSIDIES. IT IS BECAUSE -- IN OUR COUNTRY AT LEAST, WE ARE INVESTING IN THESE LONG-TERM THINGS AND CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE COMPETITION FORCES DOWN COST AND CHANGE, CREATES THE DESIRED EFFECT. THAT IS THE INTERSECTION WHERE WE NEED TO BE. SOLVING PROBLEMS, AND GROWING THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] JEB BUSH: THAT WOULD NOT BE MY SUGGESTION. IT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE DEAL. IT WOULD INCREASE UTILITY PRICES EXPONENTIALLY. THE PEOPLE HURT WOULD BE LOW INCOME PEOPLE, MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE CARE ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] >> YOU MENTIONED ENTITLEMENTS. WE ALL KNOW THAT SOCIAL SECURITY WILL NOT GO ON FOREVER IF WE DO NOT MAKE CHANGES -- ARE THEY GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY IN 7-17 YEARS, DEPENDING. WHAT KIND OF THINGS WOULD YOU BE DOING SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT HAPPEN. ENSURE SOCIAL SECURITY FOR SENIORS, KIDS, GRANDKIDS. JEB BUSH: I RESPONDED TO SOMEONE WITH THE EXACT QUESTION, SOMEONE IN THE BACK YELLED AT ME, IT IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT. IT IS ACTUALLY NOT AN ENTITLEMENT, IT IS A SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT SYSTEM. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, ENTITLEMENTS WOULD BE OBAMACARE, MEDICARE, MEDICAID. THOSE ARE ENTITLEMENT BASED ON CERTAIN CRITERIAS, INCOME OR AGE. SOCIAL SECURITY IS AN ACTUARY UNSOUND SUPPLEMENT RETIREMENT SYSTEM. IT WAS NOT THAT WAY WHEN IT WAS CREATED, WHEN WIFE EXPECTANCY WAS 64 -- LIFE EXPECTANCY WAS 64. AND RETIREMENT AGE WAS 6I-5. -- WAS AT 65. IRA MEMBER OF ADULTS IN TALKING ABOUT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT LIKE HE WAS A SOCIALIST. THAT IS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE IDEA. IMAGINE IF SOMEBODY PROPOSE THAT IN WASHINGTON DC. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED PAUL RYAN OR SOMEONE LIKE THAT, NOT ON THE LEFT. HOW DO YOU FIX IT? THE SAME WAY WE FIXED IT IN THE 1980'S. YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER FROM BOTH PARTIES. THE SIMPLE WAY OF DOING THIS IS TO RAISE THE CAP FOR HIGHER INCOME PEOPLE. AND TO MODERATELY, OVER AN EXTENDED. OF TIME -- EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGE. PROTECT AND PRESERVE IT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT. THIS WOULD BE GOING FORWARD, FOR EVERY MONTH -- YOU HAVE TAKEN A MONTH FOR EVERY YEAR, OVER TIME YOU WOULD PHASE IT IN. THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT SOLVENCY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, JUST AS IT DID IN THE 1980'S. THE BIGGER CHALLENGE IS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID -- MEDICAID. THEY ARE GROWING AT A RATE THAT IS THREE TIMES THE RATE OF ALL OF THE OTHER SPENDING. THE POWER OF COMPOUNDING ULTIMATELY WILL CONSUME EVERYTHING ELSE. TODAY, OR YESTERDAY I PROPOSED A WAY TO DEAL WITH MEDICAID, WHICH WAS TO GET IT OUT OF THE HANDS WASHINGTON. ALLOW STATES TO TAKE THE MEDICAID DOLLARS PLUS CPI GOING FORWARD, AND TAKE THE KIDS'S IS -- INSURANCE MONEY, PUT IT IN A LUMP SUM, TAKE THE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES AND PUT THEM TOGETHER AND ALLOW THE LEGISLATURES AND GOVERNORS OF STATES WITHOUT THE MANDATES THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW TO CRAFT A FIRST CENTURY INSURANCE POLICIES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE, LOW PREMIUM, EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF HSA'S. ASSUME FOR A MOMENT -- THIS IS RADICAL -- POOR PEOPLE MAKE INFORMED CHOICES WHEN YOU GIVE THEM INFORMATION. THEY WILL NOT -- THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW PEOPLE IN POVERTY CANNOT MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. THAT PERPETUATES POVERTY. THAT IS WRONG. I HAVE SEEN EXAMPLES WERE THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE. POOR PEOPLE ARE POOR, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING DECISIONS. THAT IS THE BIGGER CHALLENGE. IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS I WILL UNVEIL A PLAN AS IT RELATES TO MEDICARE. [APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE A QUESTION. YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITH MEDICAID, YOU HAVE OBAMACARE, AND PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WORK FULL-TIME. I CANNOT AFFORD INSURANCE. I DO NOT QUALIFY FOR OBAMACARE AND I AM BIPOLAR. I FIGHT EVERY DAY TO GET MEDICAID, MEDICINES, IT IS NOT CHEAP. WHEN YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE THIS, YOU WANT TO BE PRODUCTIVE. IN ORDER FOR ME TO GET INSURANCE I HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR DISABILITY. I CAN WORK, I AM CAPABLE, I CAN RUN YOUR CAMPAIGN, I COULD DO ANYTHING. JEB BUSH: I AM LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. >> THE POINT IS, I AM HERE, DOING MY JOB. I DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT GOVERNMENT MONEY. PEOPLE LIKE ME FALL TO THE CRUX -- CRACKS. HAVE YOU HELP ME -- HOW DO YOU HELP ME? JEB BUSH: WE WOULD GIVE CREDITS TO EVERY PERSON THAT DOES NOT HAVE COMPANY INSURANCE. THAT CREDIT WOULD BE EQUAL TO WHAT THEY COULD PURCHASE IN WHATEVER MEANS THEY CAN HAVE. BASICALLY TOOK THE CREDIT AMOUNT. THEN IF YOU ALLOW THE STATES TO GO FORWARD WITH NEW PLANS, STATES COULD ADD TO THAT. OR, A SMALL BUSINESS, THIS EITHER OR PROBLEM YOU FACE AS AN INDIVIDUAL, IT ALSO APPLIES TO SMALL BUSINESSES. BUSINESSES EITHER PROVIDE FULL BOAT INSURANCE WITH ALL MANDATES AND COSTS, OR NOTHING. MY PLAN -- I WOULD SAY SMALL BUSINESSES COULD ALSO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO PEOPLE'S INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE. SO THAT WAY IT IS NOT EITHER OR. THEY WOULD GET A TAX DEDUCTION FOR JEB BUSH: THE FINAL THING, YOU ARE COMPLETELY RIGHT, IT NEEDS TO BE REFORMED. IT IS ALREADY BANKRUPT, IT HAS GROWN AUTOMATICALLY AND WHEN CHALLENGES, YOU ARE EITHER DISABLED, WHICH MEANS YOU CANNOT WORK, OR YOU DO NOT DO ANYTHING HERE THERE ARE WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE PARTIAL DISABILITY, WHICH I AM NOT DIAGNOSING YOU, BUT PARTIAL DISABILITY, THERE OUGHT TO BE A PARTIAL PAYMENT. THAT MAKES COMMON SENSE, BUT THAT IS NOT HOW -- THAT WOULD REQUIRE CHANGE IN LAW. IT WOULD LESSEN THE COST OF THIS DISABILITY AND TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MARRIAGE PENALTY? YOU GOT IT. MY WIFE WOULD SAY THAT I AM THE MARRIAGE PENALTY. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU HAVE A SPOUSE WORKING PART TIME OR NOT WORKING, OR WANT TO GET BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE, EVERY DOLLAR THAT THEY EARN, IT IS TAXED AT THE MARGINAL RATE AT THEIR SPOUSE, THEY COULD BE PAYING 30% ON MAYBE MINIMUM WAGE, TO WORK PART TIME AND THAT COST IMPEDES MANY PEOPLE FROM GETTING BACK INTO THE WORK. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO FILE INDIVIDUALLY. IN ANOTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH SOCIAL SECURITY IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE, EVEN IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BE RETIRED, A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT SYSTEM, THAT MEANS YOU WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO LIVE OFF OF THAT ALONE. IF YOU ARE 67 YEARS OLD AND YOU HAVE TO WORK, YOU CONTINUE TO PAY IN CLEAR THE EMPLOYEES PORTION. YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR 50 YEARS. I PROPOSE THERE IS A WAY TO GENERATE MORE WORK, MORE INCOME FOR PEOPLE TO ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO SEVEN OR OLDER TO NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PAY INTO PAYROLL, BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR RETIREMENT, IT GOES RIGHT TO THEIR POCKET. HE HAD BEEN IN THAT FIRST INCOME TAX CREDITS AND ARE COME FAST ENOUGH COUNTRY. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE, $15 IS A HIGH BID RATE FROM LAST NIGHT. IT WILL KILL HALF A MILLION JOBS, TRUST ME. ON THE LEFT AND ON THE RIGHT, THAT IS A MUCH THE ARGUMENT AND IT IS TRUE, AUTOMATION TAKES PLACE IN PEOPLE HAVE TO LOWER COSTS. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SINGLE TO WHICH IT DOES NOT DOES NOW, BUT SAFE FROM 20-25, YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO WORK AND GET THEIR FIRST RUNG ON THE LADDER. EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS REQUIRES A CHANGE, THESE MIGHT HAVE WORKED IN 1950, MAYBE 1975, BUT THEY DO NOT WORK IN THE WORLD THEY LIVE IN TODAY. WE NEED A TRANSFORMATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT GOVERNMENT HAS AND WITH TAXES. YEAH? WE WILL DO TWO. >> GOVERNOR, I WANT TO ASK, SINCE WE ARE STANDING RIGHT HERE. MY NAME IS LIZ. IN JUNE, 2005, WE HAD AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE -- SINCE THEN I DECIDED TO JOIN FELLOW CITIZENS OF THAT BASICALLY THE U.S. AS A CITIZEN FOR FACE -- SPACE, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET CONGRESS ON BOARD, INCREASING THE BUDGET FROM UNDER 1% TO BRING THE STATE PROGRAM THAT TO THE U.S., MAKING US THE LEADING NATION IN THE WORLD AND NOT JUST RUSSIA AND CHINA? [APPLAUSE] JEB BUSH: I MAY REMEMBER, DURING MY LAST YEAR'S AS GOVERNOR, THERE WAS AN EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE PLAN THAT WAS BEING BUILT AND THE STATE OF EUROPE BUT UP -- FLORIDA PUT UP DOUGH TO WHERE -- LURE, I THINK IT WAS LOCKHEED, TO BUILD AND DESIGN THIS SAID THAT IT WOULD REPLACE THE SHUTTLE AND IT WOULD BE AN INTERIM TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF LAUNCH OLD THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE A GOOD LAUNCH IT AND HE COULD COME BACK AND IT WOULD BE A DRAMATIC LOWERING OF COST, ACCESS TO SPACE, ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PROSPER AS YOU DAY AND LEAD -- SAY IN THE LEAD OF THE WORLD. THAT PROJECT WAS KILLED AND WE NOT-- AND WE NOW ACCESS THESE THROUGH THE RUSSIANS. THAT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT IS RUNNING CIRCLES AROUND US IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT USE THE U.S. AS A MENACE, NOT AS AN ALLY IN ANY TIME THEY WOULD WANT, THE AND JUST SHUT DOWN OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE SPACE NATION WHERE IT CLEARLY WE NEED TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT MEANS TO ACCESS THE. I WOULD TAKE IT BEYOND THAT. IT IS A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES THAT ARE INCREDIBLE, I AM BIAS ED, I THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE ASPIRATIONAL AGAIN. THIS WILL SOUND ODD, BUT FOUR YEARS AGO IN A DEBATE, SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH TALKED ABOUT COLONIZING THE MOON, AND IT WAS A VERY RAUCOUS CROWD, THAT IS THEY WERE ROWDY. PEOPLE STARTED LAUGHING, PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT LAST.FM AS WELL -- LAUGHED AT HIM AS WELL, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL WHAT IS WRONG WITH HAVING BIG ASPIRATIONAL GOALS, WE ARE A BIG COUNTRY, WE ARE A GENEROUS COUNTRY AND THE BENEFITS OF THIS ARE FAR MORE THAN PEOPLE REALIZE. WE NEED TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS IN THE HERE AND NOW, HONOR -- ON EARTH, AND CREATE A STRATEGY AROUND THESE. WE CANNOT BE ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE. AND THE FINAL PART, WE SHOULD PARTNER WITH THE DREAMERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THE -- WORK WITH OTHERS DURING YOU CANNOT PLAN OUT EVERYTHING. PARTNER WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN BRING IN INTENSITY AND CREATIVITY TO THE PROCESS. I WAS JUST THINKING, YOU WERE GOING TO BRING UP THE TRAGEDY THAT TOOK PLACE, I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT, WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR, ON THE TARMAC FOR A TRIBUTE TO THE ASTRONAUTS, THAT DIED. I THINK IT WAS 2005, MAYBE -- UM , YEAH. THE OTHER ONE, 2002. IN OF THE 2000, IT WAS HORRIBLE, THIS IS A DANGEROUS ENDEAVOR, BUT IT IS WORTH IT TO BE ENGAGED IN IT. YOU REMEMBER? >> I HAVE TWO PARTS. THE FIRST PART, I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM. OK, I HEARD YOU CAN'T ABOUT TAX OR WORM, RIGHT -- REGFOFORM, RIGHT? HABITAT -- YOU AHHAVE THE TAX BRACKET AND IN THAT THE REGRESSIVE AND MOSTLY RICH PEOPLE IN THE IN THE STOCK MARKET, SO THEY HAVE LEFT FESTIVAL -- LESS INCOME, SO THAT WILL END UP BEING THE REGRESSIVE, SO YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT RICH PEOPLE CREATING JOBS. OK -- JEB BUSH: I HAVE NOT BROUGHT THAT UP TODAY. >> THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE JOBS. JEB BUSH: EXCUSE ME. >> RICH PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CREATE JOBS, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, BECAUSE THEY ARE INVEST IN THE STOCK MARKET. HOW WILL YOU GET PEOPLE TO INVEST IN THE ECONOMY AND NOT THE MARKET -- STOCK MARKET AND WILL YOU DO ABOUT THAT ARE RICH PEOPLE -- FOR RICH PEOPLE? IN ANOTHER PART OF THE QUESTION, PORTUGAL CAN MAKE -- 0POOR PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS, YOU SAID. WHAT ABOUT CULTURAL POVERTY, WHY IS IT THAT THE AVERAGE WHITE FAMILY MAKES MORE MONEY THAN THE AVERAGE BLACK ONLY -- FAMILY? WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS TO? JEB BUSH: WE HAVE INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY, IF YOU'RE BORN FOR, YOU ARE -- POOR , YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO ESCAPE FOR -- STAY POOR. I REJECT THAT. IF YOU WANT TO LIVE -- LIFT PEOPLE UP, YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM THE POWER TO MAKE CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE. IT HAS TO DO WITH PEOPLE BEING BORN POOR AND AIM FOR, BECAUSE WE HAVE SYSTEMS ON TOP OF THEM THAT LIMIT THEM. IF YOU WANT TO LIFT THEM OUT OF POVERTY, ALLOW THEM TO LIVE IN SAFE COMMUNITIES, PEOPLE IN POVERTY HAVE HIGHER PRIMARY -- CRIME RATE, AND YOU NEED TO HAVE STRONGER FAMILIES. YOUNGER FAMILIES -- STRONGER FAMILIES MATTER. AND YOU NEED TO REVOLUTIONIZE EDUCATION SO THAT EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. [APPLAUSE] JEB BUSH: AXIS -- ON TAXES, WE DO HAVE A PROGRESSIVE TAX RATE. IT IS A FAIRLY DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT, BUT MY PROPOSAL SAYS WE WILL REDUCE RATES FOR EVERYBODY, IF YOU MAKE $40,000 OR LESS, YOU WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING THAT'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX --FEDERAL INCOME TAX. EVERYBODY WOULD BENEFIT. WE WILL PUT A CAP ON IT. THE REASON THAT THE MARGINAL RATE WILL BE A LITTLE HIGHER, THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS WELL, BUT PEOPLE WITH HIGHER INCOME TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INTEREST DEDUCTIONS, THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CHARITABLE REDUCTIONS, NOT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE OR FLORIDA, BUT THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CARVEOUTS, BUT THE EFFECT IS IT LOWERS THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR PEOPLE. WE PUT A CAP ON THAT SO YOU CANNOT DEDUCT ALL THAT YOU COULD BEFORE. IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE WORN -- WARREN BUFFET STORY, SAYING THAT HE PAYS LESS THAN HIS ASSISTANT. IF YOU PUT A CAP ON DEDUCTIONS, YOU WOULD HAVE A HIGHER RATE. AND ON CORPORATE RATES, WHERE A LOT OF JOBS WILL BE CREATED, I AM SUGGESTING THE HIGHEST CORPORATE RATE, 20%, BUT ALLOW FOR FULL DEDUCTION OF CAPITAL INVEST IN, YOU WANT TO CREATE JOBS, SO ALLOW OR INVESTING IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY AND -- OWN COUNTRY. SO THAT PEOPLE ARE INVEST THE AND INVESTING IN THE REAL ECONOMY, NOT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. MY PLAN ALSO CALLS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF SPECIAL DEDUCTIONS THAT SPECIAL FIRMS GET, THE CARRIED INTEREST, WERE THEY GET CAPITAL GAINS RATES FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND THEY SHOULD PAY ORDINARY INCOME LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I AM GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THOSE POINTS OUT. THANK YOU, GO. ONE MORE. >> A QUESTION FOR YOU. ABOUT WOMEN IN COMBAT. BEING IN COMBAT, I DO NOT THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA, AT LEAST IN THE MAJOR COMBAT RANGES, MAYBE THE AIR FORCE OR NAVY, THAT IS GREAT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING -- DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING, BUT COMBAT IS A ROSE AND ARSENAL. -- UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. JEB BUSH: IN THE MILITARY, I WOULD NOT IMPOSE A POLITICAL IDEOLOGY ON THE MILITARY, OR A SOCIAL BELIEFS, YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE COMMANDERS IN THE FIELD. YOU NEED TO RESPECT -- THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAVE TO CREATE A STRATEGY, THE CHECKS AND BALANCES, BUT YOU CANNOT MICROMANAGE THE MILITARY. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY FOCUS IS ON WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL MORALE FOR OUR TROOPS TO ALLOW THEM TO BE THE SAFEST FORCE, SO THAT THE PERCEPTION OF FORCE MAKES IT LIKEM --LESS LIKELY THAT WE DO IT. I WOULD LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE MAKING THIS DECISION, NOT TELLING THEM, COME UP WITH THE RESULT I WANT. SOMETIMES I GET THE FEELING THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. I WOULD LISTEN FIRST COME UP BEFORE MAKING THAT JUDGMENT. THERE ARE CONDITIONS, BUT IF SOMEONE CAN CONVINCE ME THAT IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OR ARE FIGHTING WORSENS -- FORCES, I WOULD CONSIDER IT. RIGHT NOW, THERE IS MUCH CENTRALIZATION, JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN WASHINGTON, YOU NEED TO TRUST PEOPLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS, THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE THAN I HAVE WEIRD I WOULD TRUST THEM -- HAVE. I WOULD TRUST THEM TO MAKE THAT DECISION. YES? >> TODAY IS THE BIRTHDAY OF GENERAL EISENHOWER. [APPLAUSE] JEB BUSH: HE WAS A GOOD MAN. >> I WAS PUBLISHED -- PRIVILEGED TO BE A PENNSYLVANIA VALLEY FORGE, HE HAD STRONG WORDS, PRETTY STRONG WORDS AS PRESIDENT. THIS WAS ABOUT THE GROWING MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. I AM WONDERING, IT SEEMS LIKE OTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WANT TO KEEP GROWING OUR DEFENSES, WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES, BECAUSE THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT, I HEAR. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SET SOME LIMITS AND WILL YOU MAKE SURE THAT OPERATION --CORPORATIONS THAT TELL -- SELL WEAPONS DO NOT INFLUENCE POLITICIANS? JEB BUSH: A VERY GOOD POINT, EVERY ASPECT OF SPENDING NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGED. WHEN YOU HAVE THE F 35, THIS WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL PLANE IN THE SKY, BETTER THAN THE RUSSIANS OR THE CHINESE, BUT IT COSTS, IT IS EXPONENTIALLY MORE THAN ANYBODY IMAGINES AND IT HAS TAKEN MORE TIME THAN THEY IMAGINED. RIGHT NOW, SENATOR MCCAIN'S COMMITTEE IS LOOKING AT PROCUREMENT REFORM, THAT IS ESSENTIAL. IT OF HAVING BIG COMPLEX WEAPONS SYSTEMS THAT WERE WIRED TO-THREE CONTRACTORS -- REQUIRE CONTRACTORS, WE OUGHT TO HAVE A MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH TO THIS AND BUILD ON IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS, COST, SPEED, YOU ARE MUCH MORE AGILE YOU START SMALL AND BUILD. AND IN COMBAT TECHNOLOGY -- THINK HOW FAST TECHNOLOGY IS EVOLVING. AT 35 IS THE BIGGEST, IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG AND IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR OPPOSITION. AND IT OVERRUNS COST. AND THEN THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO BE REFRESHED ANYWAY. BETTER TO DO IT IN INCREMENTS AS NEW TECHNOLOGY EMERGES. YOU SEE THIS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF LIFE, USING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO GPS, ALL OF THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE A WEAPONS SYSTEM TO BE EFFECTIVE. THERE ARE DRAMATIC CHANGES. IN THE WAKE OF CERTAIN METALS -- WEIGHT OF CERTAIN METALS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS. IF WE DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY, WE CAN GET MANY MORE CONTRACTORS ONTO THE PLAYING FIELD AND HAVE A MORE COMPETITIVE PROCESS THAT THE BIG GUYS DO NOT DOMINATE. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] [CHATTER] (music) >> THAT IS WHY THE MILITARY IS SO IMPORTANT. >> THANK YOU. >> THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL. BEST VENUE WE HAVE HAD. >> THANK YOU. >> I AM BUSY RATE THE SECOND - - RIGHT THIS SECOND. >> I DO WANT TO SHAKE YOUR HAND. >> TOMORROW WE WILL BE GIVING OUT INFORMATION. [CHATTER] [INDISCERNIBLE] >> TRYING TO BE INTELLECTUALLY HONEST, GOING THROUGH IT IN THAT WAY. [CHATTER] >> YOU GOING TO COME BACK AT BY FEBRUARY? I WILL NOT, BUT I WILL BE VOTING. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> THANK YOU. [CHATTER] [INDISCERNIBLE] [CHATTER] >> WE SHOULD HAVE A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH ISIS, IF WE HAVE A STRATEGY OTHER COUNTRIES CAN GET BEHIND US. >> THANK YOU. >> I GREW UP IN TEXAS. >> WHAT DO YOU DO NOW? >> WORK FOR THE NAVY. >> THANK YOU. >> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SIGN MY YEARBOOK? >> THIS IS YOUR LAST YEAR? >> YES, AND I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. [CHATTER] [INDISCERNIBLE] >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU. >> CAN I KEEP THIS? >> YES, THE OTHER ONE FOR YOUR BROTHER. >> CAN I GET A PICTURE? >> YES. >> EXCUSE ME. >> WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PICTURE? THE INTERNET? THAT LOOKS BETTER THAN I NORMALLY LOOK. >> I WAS IN FLORIDA WHEN YOU WERE THE GOVERNOR. >> THANK YOU, THAT IS SO KIND OF YOU. WHERE IS THE LIGHT? >> THERE WE GO. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU GOVERNOR. >> I'M SORRY. >> DON'T LEAVE ME. >> MAY I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH? >> YES. WHERE DID SHE GO? THERE YOU ARE. >> THANK YOU. [CHATTER] >> I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. >> DO YOU MIND IF WE GET A PHOTO? >> NO, GO AHEAD. [CHATTER] >> IT IS HARDER BECAUSE OF THESE LIGHTS. >> THANK YOU. >> HEY, YOU ARE BACK. (music) [CHATTER] GOVERNOR BUSH: HOW ARE YOU, SIR? COME HERE, LET ME HOLD THAT. THANK YOU, SIR. >> CAN YOU TAKE A PICTURE? GOVERNOR BUSH: ABSOLUTELY.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?328624-1/governor-john-kasich-roh-town-hall-meeting-bow-new-hampshire,"Governor John Kasich (R-OH) Town Hall Meeting in Bow, New Hampshire",John R. Kasich,"GOV. KASICH: FALL IS HERE. GOOD AFTERNOON. [APPLAUSE] >> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. IT IS A REAL PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY IN OLD TOWN HALL IN BOW. I HAVE BEEN YOUR QUITE A FEW TIMES. I'M SURE NOT NEARLY AS OFTEN AS MANY OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE. WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO COME OUT FOR GOVERNOR KASICH'S TOWNHALL MEETING. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ASKING MARGE WELCH TO LEAD US IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. >> I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC, FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MARGE. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE I'M PROUD TO CALL A GREAT FRIEND, JOHN KASICH. I WAS FIRST ELECTED TO CONGRESS NEARLY 20 YEARS AGO. I BECAME A PROUD MEMBER OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. IT WAS EXACTLY WHERE I WANTED TO BE. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGE, IT STARTS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE, INSPIRATIONAL, AND INNOVATIVE LEADER IN JOHN KASICH. HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON SPECIAL-INTEREST AND TOUGH ISSUES, ENTITLEMENT REFORM, TAX REFORM, AND TRYING TO SCALE BACK THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON DO NOT LIKE ANYONE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. BUT HE NEVER SHIED AWAY FROM IT. HE WAS THE KIND OF LEADER I WANTED TO BE. FEARLESS, TOUGH, AND VERY INNOVATIVE. HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. MANY OF YOU KNOW HIS RECORD IN THE STATE OF OHIO. TAKING THAT SAME KIND OF LEADERSHIP, PROBLEM SOLVING, TOUGH, AGGRESSIVE -- IN A STATE LIKE OHIO THAT WAS ON TOUGH, TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES, TURNING THINGS AROUND. PIECE BY PIECE. TAKING A SURPLUS -- TAKING A DEFICIT AND TURNING IT INTO A SURPLUS. [LAUGHTER] >> NOW. [LAUGHTER] >> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE GREAT PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE MUCH KINDER TO ME WHEN I MAKE IS ALL VERBAL MISCUE LIKE THAT THEN JOHN KASICH EVER WOULD BE. BELIEVE ME, I APPRECIATE YOUR COMPASSION. IT WAS AN $8 BILLION DEFICIT WHEN HE CAME TO THE STATE OF OHIO. TODAY, THEY DO HAVE A $2 BILLION SURPLUS, CREATING OVER 350,000 JOBS, AND DOING IT WHILE CUTTING TAXES. THAT IS A RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT AND TRANSFORMATION THAT I THINK HAS REALLY BEEN MATCHED IN THIS COUNTRY AND I WANT HIM TO TAKE THAT LEADERSHIP AND VISION AND CREATIVITY AND INSPIRATION TO WASHINGTON DC. THAT IS THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP WE NEED IN WASHINGTON TODAY. WE NEED SOMEONE NOT AFRAID TO SCALE BACK THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, GIVE US BACK OUR POWER, LET US CONTROL THE MONEY, LET US CONTROL THE PROGRAMS, GET THE ECONOMY MOVING WITH TAX REFORM AND BY ROLLING BACK UNNECESSARY REGULATIONS AND UNLEASHING THE POWER OF SMALL BUSINESS. THESE ARE THINGS I HAVE SEEN JOHN KASICH ADVOCATE FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR AND TO DO IT SUCCESSFULLY. JUST TALKING ABOUT IT AND ACTUALLY DOING IT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN GO TO WASHINGTON AND GET THOSE THINGS DONE. I BELIEVE THAT PERSON IS JOHN KASICH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE MY PERSONAL FRIEND JOHN KASICH. [APPLAUSE] GUEST:GOV. KASICH: THE MAN WHO TURNS SURPLUSES INTO DEFICITS. [LAUGHTER] >>GOV. KASICH: HE WAS THE GUY THAT STUCK IT TO YOU. CAN YOU TAKE THAT PHONE. IF IT IS MY WIFE, I WILL TAKE IT. IF IT IS THE PRESIDENT, I WILL CALL HIM BACK. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: JUST KIDDING, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS IS REALLY NICE. JOHN IS A GREAT FRIEND. HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT THE FACT THAT I SHOULD DO THIS, RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I DO NOT REALLY THINK I WOULD. MANY OF YOU WILL SAY, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT HIM OR WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HIM. I WAS KIND OF TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS IN OHIO AND IT WAS REALLY A MESS. 20% OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET -- IT WOULD BE LIKE BLOWING A HOLE IN YOUR TAKE-HOME PAY. BEFORE I GET ALL TO POLICY, I WILL TELL YOU A QUICK STORY, WHICH SOME OF MY REPORTER FRIENDS IN OHIO ARE TIRED OF HEARING. I GREW UP IN A LITTLE BLUE-COLLAR TOWN OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH. THE STEELERS WON LAST NIGHT, BY THE WAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT. YOU ARE ALL NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS FANS -- YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO WIN A SUPER BOWL AGAIN WHETHER YOU BLOW THE FOOTBALL UP OR NOT. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: SOMEBODY IS HISSING AT ME. THERE IS A GUY HERE NAMED TOM RATH. I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE FOR ME --SO I TOLD HIM I WAS GOING TO PUT A CURSE ON THE BOSTON RED SOX. I TOOK OFF THE CURSE ONLY FOR HOME GAMES WHEN HE ENDORSED ME. I GREW UP IN THIS LITTLE HOMETOWN. HE -- MY FATHER CARRIED MAIL ON HIS BACK. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A COAL MINER. HE DIED OF THE BLACK LUNG. MY FATHER'S FAMILY WAS HARDSCRABBLE. MY MOTHER WAS UNDEREDUCATED, WAS NEVER ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE. HER MOTHER LIVED WITH US, WAS AN IMMIGRANT FROM YUGOSLAVIA. THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP WAS ALMOST ALL DEMOCRAT. PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE GREAT SECURITY. IF THE WIND BLEW THE WRONG WAY, THEY COULD FIND THEMSELVES OUT OF WORK. IT IS WHERE I GOT MY VALUES. IF I WERE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE VALUES -- OR THE VALUES I MAY HAVE CARRIED INTO POLITICS -- IT WOULD BE STICKING UP FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT I GREW UP WITH. A LOT OF TIMES, NO ONE REPRESENTS THEM. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE THAT PUTS YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEARS AND THE CONCERNS AND THE HOPEFULNESS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHO PLAY BY THE RULES, TRY TO GET AHEAD, TRY TO TEACH THEIR KIDS ABOUT HOW GREAT OUR COUNTRY IS IN THAT THEY CAN BE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO BE. THAT IS WHAT I LEARNED WHEN I WAS A KID. I LEFT AND WENT TO A SMALL MIDWESTERN SCHOOL. NOT SURE IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF IT. IT IS CALLED OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: I WAS THERE FOR A SHORT TIME AND I WAS VERY FRUSTRATED BY SOME THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING. BIG BUREAUCRACY, RIGHT? RED TAPE AND ALL OF THAT. GREAT PLACE, I LOVED IT, BUT IT WAS TRYING. I ASKED FOR A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY. YOU ALWAYS START AT THE TOP. I BADGERED HIM TO LET ME IN. HE HAD A VERY IMPRESSIVE OFFICE, BEAUTIFUL RUGS AND CHAIRS AND ALL THAT. HE ASKED ME WHAT WAS ON MY MIND AND I TOLD HIM AND I SAID, SIR, I HAVE BEEN IN COOLER MONTH -- IN SCHOOL ABOUT A MONTH, BUT MAYBE THIS IS THE JOB FOR ME IN THIS OFFICE. WHAT DO YOU DO? HE TOLD ME ABOUT HIS FUNDRAISING AND ACADEMIC RESPONSIBILITIES. HE SAID HE WOULD VISIT WITH PRESIDENT NIXON THE NEXT DAY. I SAID, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WITH HIM ALSO. I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH YOU. HE SAID, NO. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: I SAID, IF I WRITE A LETTER, WILL YOU GIVE IT TO HIM? I WROTE A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT INVITING MYSELF FOR A DISCUSSION. I GO TO MY MAILBOX A COUPLE WEEKS LATER AND THERE WAS A LETTER FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND I OPEN IT UP AND I GO UPSTAIRS AND I CALL HOME AND MY MOTHER ANSWERS THE PHONE AND I SAID, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MEETING WITH ME IN THE OVAL OFFICE. MY MOTHER IS SHOUTING, PICK UP THE PHONE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH JOHNNY. THEY BUY ME AN AIRLINE TICKET, I FLY TO WASHINGTON, I GET IN THROUGH THE SECURITY, I'M SITTING OUTSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE. THE GUY SAID, YOU GET FIVE MINUTES ALONE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I TELL YOU WHAT I'M THINKING. NEW JACKET, NEW SHIRT, NEW TIE, I'M NOT COMING OUT IN FIVE MINUTES. THEY OPENED UP THE DOOR, I WALKED IN, I GREETED THE PRESIDENT, I SPENT 20 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE AS AN 18-YEAR-OLD FIRST-QUARTER FRESHMAN AND THE BAD NEWS IS I SPENT 18 YEARS IN CONGRESS AND IF YOU ADD UP ALL THE TIME IN THE OVAL OFFICE, I'D PEEK OUT AT THE TIME I WAS 18 YEARS OLD. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: BOBBY RAHAL IS AN INDYCAR DRIVER. HE WON THE INDY 500 AND I TOOK HIM IN TO SEE PRESIDENT REAGAN. WE WALKED IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND THERE IS PRESIDENT REAGAN AND BOBBY IS MELTING AND I MET REAGAN IN 1976 AS A REALLY YOUNG MAN AND WORKED WITH HIM. THE PRESIDENT LOOKS AT BOBBY RAY HAL AND SAYS, YOU EVER HEARD OF BARNEY OLFIELD? HE WAS A GREAT INDYCAR DRIVER, RIGHT? BOBBY SAID, SURE. REAGAN SAID, ONE DAY I WAS DRIVING MY CAR ON THE CALIFORNIA FREEWAY AND I LIKE TO DRIVE REALLY FAST AND I GOT PULLED OVER BY A STATE TROOPER AND HE WALKED UP TO THE WINDOW ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE BARNEY OLFIELD? HE SAID, NO, BUT HE SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ME. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: I WAS A STATE SENATOR AND 26. I WAS THE YOUNGEST ELECTED IN OHIO. I KNEW NO ONE. I BUILT A TEAM OF PEOPLE. A WOMAN DROVE FOUR HOURS TO SEE ME IN VERMONT AND SHE HAS BEEN HELPING ME SINCE 1977. WHY? I HAVE NO CLUE. I THINK THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: SHE HAS BEEN A DEVOTED PARTNER OF MINE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF, WE WANT HIM TO DO WELL. THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO HELPED ME FIRST GET ELECTED. I WAS A TROUBLEMAKER, I SHOOK IT UP IN THE STATE SENATE. I WENT THROUGH AS IN OHIOAN. NOT A REPUBLICAN, THOUGH I WAS. I WROTE MY FIRST BUDGET. THAT GOT EVERYBODY WORKED UP. I WENT TO CONGRESS AT THE AGE OF 30. MY MOM AND DAD -- MY HOMETOWN, POLITICIANS GOT INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE. ONE TIME, I WENT TO MY CLASS REUNION AND ONE OF MY CLASSMATES WALKED UP TO ME AND SAID, JOHNNY -- THEY USED TO CALL ME POPE -- HE SAID, I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE A CONGRESSMAN. I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD. HE SAID, I VOTED FOR YOU TO BE ONE OF THE MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED. WHAT WENT WRONG? [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: AND HE WASN'T LAUGHING. OK? I GOT ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND MY MOTHER AND FATHER WERE AMAZED. MY PARENTS WERE JUST REGULAR, OLD FOLKS. MY SON WAS GOING TO GO -- HERE IS THEIR SON GOING TO WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT. I SERVED ON THE DEFENSE COMMITTEE EXCLUSIVELY FOR MY FIRST FEW YEARS. YOU REMEMBER THE HAMMERS AND THE SCREWDRIVERS AND THE WRENCHES? I FOUND THAT WITH SOME OTHER CONGRESSMAN AND THAT STARTED THE REFORM OF THE PENTAGON. I'M A BELIEVER IN REFORMING THE MILITARY, BUT MAKING SURE THE MILITARY IS STRONG. WHEN YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN AND REFORMING THE MILITARY, HOW DO YOU THINK THAT GOES OVER? NOT WELL. SO WHAT? THAT IS MY JOB. TO FIX THINGS, IMPROVE THINGS AREA -- THINGS. A WASTED MONEY IS NOT GETTING IN THE HANDS OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY. SIX YEARS IN, I GOT ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. JOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT MY WORK. MY FIRST YEAR, I WAS IN MY HOMETOWN AND I WAS FILLING UP MY GAS TANK AND I HAD BEEN TO A COUPLE BUDGET COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT I LEARNED. I SAID, THE REPUBLICANS DID NOT HAVE A GOOD PLAN, THE REPUBLICANS DID NOT HAVE A GOOD PLAN AND I WAS SQUAWKING ABOUT IT. THIS GUY WALKS AROUND THE GAS TANK AND SAYS, IF IT IS IT -- IF IT SO BAD, WHAT YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? IT IS PRETTY POWERFUL. I FLEW TO WASHINGTON, I CALLED MY STAFF, I SAID WE ARE GOING TO WRITE A BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEY SAID, THERE ARE A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE ONLY HAVE SIX. I SAID, I KNOW THAT WE ARE OVERSTAFFED, BUT IF WE STAY OUT OF EACH OTHER'S WAY. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: I THOUGHT IT WAS DOING GREAT WITH 30 VOTES. EACH YEAR, I STARTED RECRUITING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE. THOSE NUMBERS GREW. LET ME TELL YOU. YESTERDAY, WE WERE AT THIS BIG, PUBLIC MEETING. HE SAID, I'M TRYING TO CLEAN UP THINGS IN MY HOMETOWN AND I'M REALLY UNPOPULAR AND I KEEP FIGHTING SPENDING. WHEN YOU WORK INSIDE OF GOVERNMENT AND YOU TRY TO CHANGE IT, YOU DON'T WIN A POPULARITY CONTEST, BUT IF YOU ARE RIGHT AND IF YOU ARE THINKING APPROPRIATELY, PEOPLE WILL JOIN YOU. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE WORKING AGAINST. IF WHAT YOU ARE WORKING AGAINST AND WHAT YOU ARE FOR IS COMPELLING, WHATEVER IT IS, YOU WILL START OFF ALL ALONE, BUT OVER TIME, PEOPLE WILL HELP YOU. I TEACH THAT TO MY DAUGHTERS. I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE 16 IN JANUARY. THEY ARE STILL LEARNING A LOT. WE JUST KEPT AT IT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND I WOULD UPSET THE APPLE CART YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AREA ONE YEAR, WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON RAISED TAXES, WE GOT TOGETHER WITH A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATS TO TAKE A PENNY OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR OF FEDERAL SPENDING AND CONGRESSMAN SWEAT, THIS IS HIS HOME, HE DESERVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR HIS WORK IN WASHINGTON PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] GOV. KASICH: I DON'T CARE WHAT PARTY YOU ARE IN. COME ON, LET ME SEE SOME APPLAUSE. LOOK, WE CAN'T BE A PLACE IN AMERICA WHERE WE CAN'T FIND COMMON GROUND WITH PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT ALWAYS SHARE OUR PHILOSOPHY OR OUR PARTY PREFERENCE. WE ARE NOT A PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE IN ENGLAND. IF WE WANT TO SWITCH -- IF WE WANT TO SWITCH TO THAT, LET'S CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION. I'M NOT FOR IT. DICK WAS A GOOD MAN AND WE FOUGHT -- WE WERE FOUGHT BY EVERYBODY. WE BECAME THE MAJORITY, I BECAME THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. IN WRITING EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET, WE FINALLY GOT TO A BALANCED BUDGET AGREEMENT. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE BALANCED THE BUDGET AND'S MAN WALKED ON THE MOON. WE DID IT FOR FOUR YEARS, PAY DOWN SOME OF THE DEBT. WHEN I LEFT WASHINGTON, WE HAD A PROJECTED $5 TRILLION SURPLUS, ALL OF WHICH GOT SPENT. I JUST NEVER THOUGHT THEY COULD SPEND THAT. I THOUGHT, THAT IS INCONCEIVABLE TO ME. BEING GOVERNOR OF OHIO, I LEARNED SOMETHING ELSE BEING AN EXECUTIVE. MAYBE EVEN BEING IN WASHINGTON. PEOPLE WANT US TO SPEND. IT EXPANDS GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE NOT ALL THAT INTERESTED IN CUTTING IT BACK. THERE ARE ALWAYS INTEREST GROUPS THAT DEFEND WHAT IS GOING ON. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOUGH SPINE. YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO PUT YOUR NECK OUT THERE. BUT IN POLITICS, THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING. IT IS A UNIQUE PROFESSION. IT IS A PLACE WHERE YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN IT FOR A LIFETIME. YOU SHOULD BE IN IT TO DO AS MUCH GOOD AS YOU CAN. THE BEST WAY IS TO GET IN AND OUT OF POLITICS. THAT IS THE BEST WAY. I LEFT FOR 10 YEARS. I WORKED AS AN INVESTMENT BANKER FOR LEHMAN BROTHERS. I TRAVELED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I WROTE BOOKS, MADE SPEECHES. YOU ALL REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A HUGE TELEVISION STAR AT FOX NEWS. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: BIG. WASN'T I? YOU DON'T REMEMBER THAT. I HAVE TAPES IN THE CAR. YOU COULD WATCH. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: THEN I GOT A CALL TO GO BACK IN. HOWEVER YOU FEEL, YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL. I FEEL LIKE THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME. HE HAS GIVEN ME OPPORTUNITY TO DO MANY THINGS THAT NEVER WHAT I HAVE DREAMT OF LIVING UP IN THAT LITTLE BLUE-COLLAR TOWN,. MY PARENTS ALWAYS SAID SHOOT FOR THE STARS, WHICH IS WHAT I ALWAYS TELL YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU REALLY SHOULD TELL EVERYBODY. WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED, IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BACK. I'VE TOLD MY WIFE I WAS GOING TO GO BACK INTO POLITICS AND RUN FOR GOVERNOR. SHE SAID, THAT IS JUST GREAT. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: SO I RAN AND I WON AND THE PLACE WAS A TOTAL MESS. SO WE HAVE GONE FROM THE $8 BILLION IN THE HOLE TO $2 BILLION IN THE BLACK. DOWN 350,000 JOBS TO UP 400,000 JOBS. $5 BILLION IN TAX CUTS. WAGES HAVE RISEN FASTER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. CREDIT IS STRONG. WE ARE DOING PRETTY WELL IN OHIO. PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SHADOWS, THE MENTALLY ILL, THE DRUG ADDICTED, THE WORKING POOR, WE ARE ATTENDING TO THEM, AS WELL. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP OUR MINORITIES TO GROW. MORE ENTREPRENEURSHIP TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I TRIED THIS LIKE 16 YEARS AGO. I WAS JUST VERY YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED. I WAS AT THIS HOUSE PARTY AND I WAS HAVING THIS CHAT WITH THIS LADY AND I'M THINKING, THIS LADY IS GOING TO RUN THIS TOWN FOR ME. SHE SAYS, WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK THE CANDIDATE IS GOING TO GET HERE? [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: SO I LEFT AND HERE I AM BACK AGAIN. I LOVE BEING BACK HERE. I LIKE THIS PROCESS. ON THURSDAY, I'M GOING TO UNVEIL A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO GET THE COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD. IT WILL HAVE TO DO WITH FISCAL ISSUES, DEBT, BALANCING BUDGETS. IT WILL HAVE TO DO WITH SHIFTING POWER FROM WASHINGTON BACK TO THE WEEKEND -- BACK TO WHERE WE LIVE. [APPLAUSE] GOV. KASICH: IT WILL HAVE TO DO WITH PUTTING A HALT ON REGULATIONS. WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A COMMON SENSE COURT. IF YOU ARE GETTING HASSLED BY THE FEDERAL REGULATOR, YOU WILL HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO OUTSIDE OF SOME GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRAT THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU YOU LOSE. WE ARE GOING TO BE PROMOTING THE COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY POLICY, TAX POLICY TO PROVIDE MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH. ALL OF THIS IS DESIGNED -- ARE PROBABLY LEFT SOMETHING OUT, REFORMING TRADE -- ALL OF THIS IS DESIGNED TO CREATE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO CONTROL OUR SPENDING AND TO RESTORE PROSPERITY IN OUR COUNTRY. NOW, IT WILL BE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. IT WILL BE A BLUEPRINT. I'VE ONLY BEEN A CANDIDATE FOR SLIGHTLY OVER TWO MONTHS. MAYBE 2.5 MONTHS. WE WILL FILL THIS IN AS WE GET FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD. I WILL ABSOLUTELY HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WILL KILL AT LEAST ONE DEPARTMENT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I ALREADY KNOW WHICH ONE I LIKE. WE'VE GOT TO WORK THROUGH IT. THESE THINGS ARE COMPLICATED. WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME TO WASTE. AND TRYING -- COMING UP WITH SOMETHING, IDEAS DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DON'T GET THEM DONE. IF YOU'VE GOT A PROGRAM THAT SAYS WE ARE GOING TO REPAINT THE HOUSE THIS SPRING, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PAINT, WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO? YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT IS PRACTICAL AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WAY TO GET IT DONE. IF YOU DON'T GET IT DONE, YOU ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A CLANGING BELL. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT. I'D BE WASTING MY TIME. I KNOW HOW TO GET THESE THINGS DONE. IT IS NOT BECAUSE I'M SO SMART, BUT I HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THE CONGRESSMEN. CONGRESSMAN SWEAT SAID I WILL HELP YOU DEAL WITH ENTITLEMENTS. YOU HAVE TO PUT TEAMS OF PEOPLE TOGETHER WHO WANT TO BRING ABOUT BIG CHANGE. SO, I'VE DONE IT A BUNCH OF TIMES AND I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO DO IT TO HELP THE COUNTRY TO DO BETTER AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE NOT CONTINUING TO BE PUSHED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO DEBT. WHERE WE CAN GET A MORE SOLID ECONOMY SO PEOPLE CAN WORK. WORK IS DIGNITY, ISN'T IT? IT IS ABOUT FAMILY. IT IS ABOUT HOW WE FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES. I THINK CREATING JOBS IS OUR GREATEST MORAL PURPOSE. THE GOVERNMENT CAN CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE JOBS CAN HAPPEN. NO PIE IN THE SKY FOR ME, FOLKS. REFORM PROPOSALS THAT I THINK IT PASS -- COULD PASS. I WILL PUT THE SPRING WORKOUT ON THURSDAY THAT WILL SPELL OUT THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE KASICH ADMINISTRATION. THAT IS HARD TO SAY THAT SOMETIMES. THAT IS A BIG THOUGHT, BEING PRESIDENT. SOME PEOPLE RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY SAY, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT. THE REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE WE ARE BACK TO THE BLESSINGS AND THE GIFTS AND I WANT TO GIVE BACK AND HELP MY COUNTRY. I DO HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, WE HAD A CHRISTMAS TREE WITH A LITTLE ELECTRIC TRAIN THAT RAN UNDER IT AND YOU COULD PUT THE STUFF UNDER THE TREE. UNDER THE TREE WAS A WHITE HOUSE. I WENT THROUGH MY CLOSET THE OTHER DAY AND THERE IT WAS. IF I DON'T WIN -- IF I DON'T WIN, I WILL JUST LOOK AT IT AND IMAGINE. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: ALL RIGHT, QUESTIONS. WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST? [APPLAUSE] >> I'M A RETIRED FEDERAL EMPLOYEE. I LOVED MY JOB. GOV. KASICH: WHERE DID YOU WORK? >> I WAS AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER. I LOVED THE JOB, BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE BUREAUCRACY, THE INEFFICIENT THE, AND THE FACT THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT I WORKED WITH THAT COULD HIDE IN THE SHADOWS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD DEPARTMENTS, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HIDING IN THE SHADOWS THAT ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB AND I HOW THOUGHT, IF THAT COULD GET CLEANED OUT, THAT WOULD SAVE ON EFFICIENCY. GOV. KASICH: NO QUESTION. FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO WHAT I'M GOING TO SAYGOV. KASICH: ON THURSDAY. COME DOWN TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU WILL SEE MORE. BUT AS WE MOVE THINGS OUT OF WASHINGTON AND MOVE THEM BACK TO THE STATES -- I WILL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. WE HAVE 100 SEPARATE -- IT MAY BE MORE THAN 100 SEPARATE WASHINGTON AND MOVE THEM BACK TO THE STATESPROGRAMS. WE WILL ELIMINATE RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY. THEN YOU CAN RUN IT FROM HERE AND NOT FROM WASHINGTON, RIGHT? AS YOU SHIFT THESE PROGRAMS OUT, YOU CAN DO WITH STRINGS AND BUREAUCRACY. WHEN PEOPLE RETIRE, DON'T FILL THEIR JOBS. IN OHIO, WE HAVE THE LOWEST NUMBER OF STATE EMPLOYEES IN 30 YEARS. YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO FIRE PEOPLE UNLESS YOU ARE DOING A REALLY BAD JOB OR IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BECAUSE WHAT DOES THAT ACHIEVE, REALLY? SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPLACED IN OHIO. THE BULK OF IT IS THROUGH ATTRITION. YOU JUMP IN AND YOU DO MORE. LEARN THE OTHER JOB. THERE ARE TWO OTHER ELEMENTS. ONE, THE LEADERSHIP. IS THE LEADERSHIP INSPIRING OR ARE THEY DULL, BORING, AND DON'T CARE? LEADERSHIP CAN MOTIVATE PEOPLE. FINALLY, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY, WHICH WE TRY TO DO IN OHIO, TO ENERGIZE THE PEOPLE WHO DO WORK IN THE GOVERNMENT. YOU WANT A BAD PERSON. I'M GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOURSELF. [LAUGHTER] GOV. KASICH: THERE IS A REALITY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED THESE FOLKS. THEY GET FRUSTRATED BY WHAT THEY SEE. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SET THEM LOOSE. ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE CREATIVE, TO TAKE MORE RISKS. DO THINGS THAT ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND INNOVATIVE AND FUN. IF ALL THEY DO IS GO TO WORK AND PUNCH A CLOCK. YOU HAVE A MORALE PROBLEM. IF THEY HAVE A GOOD IDEA, TELL US WHAT IT IS. IF I SAY ANYTHING, I MIGHT LOSE MY JOB. YOU HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE PERMISSION TO BE WHO THEY ARE. WAS THAT A TOUGH JOB? >> I THINK IT WAS A GREAT FIT FOR ME. I LOVED IT. I DID NOT THINK IT WAS A TOUGH JOB. GOV. KASICH: YOU GUIDED PLANES DOWN? THAT IS REALLY COOL. THANK YOU. >> I'M AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE MINISTRY. GOV. KASICH: WHAT CHURCH? >> UCC SOUTH CHURCH. WE JUST HAD A CONFERENCE ON THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO SAVE GOD'S CREATION. IN ADDITION TO NATURAL CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WE KNOW THAT MAN HAS INCREASED THE RATE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EXHIBITED IN OUR RECENT EXTREME DROUGHTS AND HURRICANES AND SNOWSTORMS. DO YOU PLAN TO DECREASE MAN 'S -- MAN'S INCREASE ON GLOBAL WARMING BY PREVENTING THE KEYSTONE PIPELINES AND FRACKING? GOV. KASICH: I WOULD BUILD THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE TOMORROW, IF I COULD. [APPLAUSE] GOV. KASICH: BUT LOOK. I APPRECIATE WHAT SHE IS SAYING. WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT AND, LOOK, I FLEW IN YESTERDAY LOOKING AT BEAUTIFUL NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH THE CHANGING LEAVES. IT IS BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL. I'M GOING TO BE WAY UP IN THE NORTH COUNTRY. BEAUTIFUL. WE DON'T WANT TO DESTROY THAT. WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF IT. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO WORSHIP IT. SOMETIMES PEOPLE LEAD TO CONCLUSIONS THAT I THINK ARE NOT ACCURATE. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT IN OUR COUNTRY, WHICH I THINK YOU AGREE WITH, IS ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE DON'T WANT TO RELY ON REGIMES IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT ARE RADICAL. SAUDI ARABIA FUNDS A BUNCH OF RADICAL CLERICS. WE WANT TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT IN NORTH AMERICA. WE WANT TO REDUCE THE COST OF ENERGY IN AMERICA SO WE CAN BRING SOME OF THAT HEAVY INDUSTRY BACK TO AMERICA. WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME OF THAT HAPPEN. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE THINK THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH BEING GOOD STEWARDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. WHY THINK THAT MAN HAS IMPACTED CLIMATE CHANGE? I DO. TO WHAT DEGREE, THE JURY IS STILL OUT. THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS LIKE MERCURY. WE DO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. IN OHIO, WE REDUCED EMISSIONS BY 30% IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. IF I LEAVE TO JUDGMENT AND IT PUTS THIS MAN OUT OF WORK, YOU DON'T WANT HIM OUT OF WORK. I BELIEVE BEING GOOD STEWARDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT I ALSO BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE ALL KINDS OF ENERGY. WE ARE TO HAVE RENEWABLE ENERGY, WIND AND SOLAR. I WILL HAVE A PROPOSAL TO PUT WIND TURBINES AND FRONT OF EVERY STATE CAPITAL IN AMERICA. >> THEY ARE ALREADY THERE. >> NO, THE WIND IS THERE, WE JUST HAVE NOT CAPTURED IT. I JUST THINK RENEWABLES -- WITH COLD, I THINK WE SHOULD CLEAN IT AND BURN IT. WE HAVE BIG NATURAL GAS IN OHIO NOW. THE OTHER THING, BEING A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH, IS WE DON'T WANT TO WORSHIP THE ENVIRONMENT. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> AND I WANT TO BE UP GOOD STEWARD. BUT IT IS GETTING BETTER. >> [INAUDIBLE] WAIT A MINUTE, FRACKING, WE DON'T HAVE A METHANE PROBLEM IN OHIO. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> WHAT IS IT? >> THE AQUIFERS. >> BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. I CAN HAVE PEOPLE CALL YOU AND TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW WE HANDLE THE ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE THE TYPIST ENVIRONMENTAL ROLES IN AMERICA IN THE STATE OF OHIO BECAUSE IT IS NOT INCONSISTENT TO BE ABLE TO FRACK AND HAVE A GOOD ENVIRONMENT. IT WE DON'T DO IT, THEN I GOT TO GO BUY MY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS. I WOULD RATHER NOT PUT MY FRIENDS OUT OF WORK. IT IS A BALANCE, BUT I APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU HAVE ENGAGED IN YOUR CHURCH IN SPEAKING UP POST UP I THINK IT IS GREAT. WE WILL WORK ON IT TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT IS NOT LIKE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE MAN HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. I DON'T A BULLY WITH -- I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. WE CAN TAKE A LOT OF STEPS. WE COULDN'T TAKE THEM INSIDE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO WITH CLEANING OUR COAL. WE TAKEN WHAT COMES TO FRACKING. YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT IT. THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OVERBOARD WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED. >> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE PENTAGON HAD A PLAN TO UPGRADE OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL, OUR SUBS, PLANES, LAND-BASED MISSILES, AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY ONE TO DOLLARS. -- $1 TRILLION. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY ON WEAPONS WE REALLY CANNOT AFFORD. AND WE CAN'T REALLY USE, WHEN HE STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT IT. SECONDLY, AS A TAXPAYER, I WANT THAT TRILLION DOLLARS, OR MOST OF IT, BEING SPENT ON REPAIRING, REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE COME AS YOU WILL NO. AND I WANT MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE WANT MORE HIGH-SPEED RAIL. WE WANT MORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR EDUCATION, FOR HEALTH CARE. IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR PRIORITY? >> FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS A LOT OF PRESUMPTIONS IN HERE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT COSTS $120 TO UPGRADE OUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITY. SECONDLY, I AM UP FOR UPGRADING IT BECAUSE IT IS PART OF OUR DETERRENT. LOOK, WHEN IT COMES TO THE PENTAGON, I BELIEVE THAT WE NOT ONLY NEED TO PROPERLY FUND THESE WEAPON SYSTEMS -- I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO BE HAVING NO-FLY ZONE IN SYRIA AND NOT DOMINATE THE SKIES IF PUTIN DECIDES HE WAS TO FLY A PLANE IN THERE. OUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE. THAT IS WHAT GEORGE WASHINGTON TAUGHT US. I THINK HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD PRESIDENT. IN FACT, HE WAS MY FAVORITE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE PENTAGON, WE SHOULD HAVE THE PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE THREATS THAT WE HAVE. WE LOVE TO THINK WE LIVE IN A COUP BY YOUNG WORLD, BUT WE DO NOT. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DESTROY US. THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT IS PART OF OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL. IT IS IMPERATIVE, AS WE REBUILD THE PENTAGON, WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE THE PENTAGON IS EFFICIENT BECAUSE IT IS INEFFICIENT JUST LIKE THE FAA YOU EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS TO DON'T SPEND ANY MORE THAN WHAT YOU NEED ON THINGS YOU DON'T NEED BECAUSE IT DEPRIVES OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY OF HAVING THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. >> [INAUDIBLE] THE BENEFIT TO BUILDING THESE WEAPONS GOES TO THESE CORPORATIONS. >> I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE BENEFIT TO CORPORATION. I CARE ABOUT HAVING A STRONG DEFENSE. >> I WAS INVOLVED ELIMINATING THE B-2 BOMBER. I WANTED TO BUILD 13 AND THE RESULT WAS WE BUILT 20. I FOUGHT EVERY MAJOR CONTRACTOR IN AMERICA TO GET THAT DONE, AND I HAD NOTHING TO OFFER THEM BUT A COLD CUP OF COFFEE. I THINK YOU ARE WITH ME ON THAT AND YOU ARE WITH ME ON THAT AND JOHNSON WAS WITH ME ON THAT AND WE GOT IT DONE. I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE LOBBYISTS. THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OPINIONS. SOMETIMES THEY WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT IS RIGHT. BUT THEY'RE NOT -- THEY DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO OR MY TEAM. THE MINUTE YOU DO THAT, YOU LOST THE HIGH MORAL GROUND. YES OR, RIGHT BACK -- YES, SIR, RIGHT BACK YOUR. >> THANK YOU. DEFENSE IS WELL AND GOOD BUT OUR ARMED FORCES HAVE GOTTEN THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. WHEN WE HAD A CAPTAIN TO PLAYED IN AFGHANISTAN GETTING LETTER SAYING, YOU WILL NOT BE CONTINUED IN SERVICE AT THE END OF YOUR DEPLOYMENT. THE POTENTIAL WRITER FOR ANOTHER 40,000 SERVICEMEN TO BE PUT ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SAY THEY ARE BEING LAID OFF, WEAPON SYSTEMS ARE NOT BEING UPGRADED, NEW EQUIPMENT ISN'T BEING PROCURED. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET AWAY FROM -- WE WILL CALL IT THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IN CONGRESS THAT GOES TO THE BIG WEAPON SYSTEMS AND IGNORES THE LITTLE GUYS? >> BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MATCH. WHEN ALL IS LIMITED THE PRODUCTION OF THE B-2, I WANTED TO TAKE THE SAVINGS TO BUILD STANDOFF WEAPONS SO THAT WE DID NOT HAVE TO FLY PILOTS OVER THE TARGET AND PUT THEM AT RISK. WE SAW A LOT OF THAT USED IN THE FIRST GULF WAR. SECONDLY, OUR MILITARY HAS TO BE LETHAL, AND IT HAS TO BE MOBILE. FOR EXAMPLE, I SAID I WOULD NEVER HAVE INCREASED TROOP LEVELS IN AFGHANISTAN. I WOULD HAVE USED SPECIAL FORCES TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHEN WE SAW THEM POP UP. ONE OF THE GROUPS IN THE PENTAGON -- I DON'T HOW MANY ARE STILL THERE. BUT I WORKED WITH THEM IN THE AREA OF SPECIAL FORCES. I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN SPECIAL FORCES BECAUSE THAT IS THE FUTURE OF FOR FAIR. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T NEED A STRONG ARMY. YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG ARMY. WE'RE CUTTING IT TOO LOW. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO SPEND MORE ON DEFENSE. ON THURSDAY TO COME DOWN TO NASHUA TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DOWN THERE, YOU'LL SEE A NUMBER AS TO WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO FIT IN THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO SPEND FOR DEFENSE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD DEFENSE. WE CAN'T BE WEAK. WE HAVE TO BE STRONG. SO OVER TIME -- ARE YOU TO BUILD THE THINGS YOU REALLY NEED, NOT SOMETHING THAT SUMMIT HE SAYS, HEY, HERE'S A GREAT NEW SYSTEM. THEY HAVE TO WORK TO STOP THE OTHER THING IS, I WILL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE, THE ROADSIDE DEVICES THAT WERE BLOWING OUR PEOPLE UP IN IRAQ, THE MILITARY GOT TOGETHER, AND I THINK WAS IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, THEY DEPLOYED A HOLY SYSTEM. YOU KNOW WHY? THEY SAID, WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RED TAPE, THAT THIS AND THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WE NEED THIS FOR OUR SOLDIERS AND THEY GOT IT. IT USUALLY TAKES OVER 20 YEARS TO DEPLOY SOMETHING. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. WE NEED A LOT OF COMMON SENSE BACK IN GOVERNMENT. WHEN HE COMMON SENSE ON THE REGULATIONS AND THE TAX CODE. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS, THERE ARE SO MANY OVER-THE-TOP REQUIREMENTS FOR WHO CAN BE INVOLVED IN HOW YOU CHANGE THINGS. SO IF YOU STREAMLINE A PROCESS, SOMEBODY WRITES A STORY SAYING, OH, WELL, THERE'S CONFLICTS AND THIS OTHER BUSINESS AND THIS IS BAD. IF WE DON'T CUT THROUGH THE GORDIAN KNOT OF ALL OF THIS STUFF PILED ON ALL THE STUFF, YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. SO WE NEED TO STREAMLINE, NOT JUST THE PENTAGON, WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT . AND, BY THE WAY, NOT HEARING ANY MORE PEOPLE. HOW ABOUT MORE TECHNOLOGY? WE ARE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, NOT THE EARLIEST 20 CENTURY. SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY THE HECK I'M DOING THIS, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. >> YESTERDAY WE HEARD A CONFERENCE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO COMPROMISE. HOW DO YOU STAND FIRM ON POLICIES THAT WE FEEL AS CONSERVATIVES ARE RIGHT IT SHOULD NOT BE COMPROMISED ON? >> DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY? DO YOU HAVE A HUSBAND? OK. RIGHT THERE. LET ME START WITH HIM. [LAUGHTER] I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER. WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR WIFE, DO YOU GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT? DO YOU EVER HAVE TO GIVE UP ANYTHING THAT YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP? YOU DO? OK. YOU PROBABLY NEVER DO, DO YOU? [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE I SAID THAT, SOMEBODY WILL ATTACK ME IN THE PRESS. LET'S ALSO GET A SENSE OF HUMOR BACK IN AMERICA, OK? I AM SO TIRED OF ALL OF THIS NONSENSE. [APPLAUSE] SO, ANYWAY, WE SOMEHOW SEPARATE POLITICS FROM LIFE. I THINK, OK, IN POLITICS, WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE. BUT IN LIFE WE GET ALL THE TIME. DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN? DO YOU HAVE RELATIVES AND WHO IS COMING OVER FOR THANKSGIVING? I MEAN, LIFE IS FULL OF COMPROMISES. BUT YOU KIND OF KNOW -- YOU KIND OF KNOW WHEN THAT COMPROMISE IS ERODING YOUR PRINCIPAL, DON'T YOU? THAT IS THE WAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN POLITICS. YOU CAN'T BE A STUBBORN IDEOLOGUE THAT SAYS IT IS MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. I REMEMBER -- I WILL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES. I REMEMBER WHEN RONALD REAGAN WAS MEETING WITH GORBACHEV. GORBACHEV SAID, WHAT WE WILL DO IS WE WILL -- WE WILL GET RID OF STAR WARS AND YOU -- YOU GET RID OF STAR WARS AND WE WILL GET RID OF ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS. REAGAN KNEW WE NEEDED MISSILE DEFENSE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE SAID, SORRY, NO. HE GOT IN THE CAR AND LEFT. ULTIMATELY, IT WORKED OUT. THE SOVIET UNION FELL APART BECAUSE OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN 1995 I WAS INVOLVED IN THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION WAS PROPOSING PIE-IN-THE-SKY SOLUTIONS THAT WERE UNREALISTIC. I FELT IT WAS OUR LAST TIME TO DELIVER A MESSAGE TO GET TO A BALANCED BUDGET. I ALSO KNEW BILL CLINTON -- BILL CLINTON IS A GUY IF A RIGHT IS COMING AT HIM, HE JUMPS IN FRONT OF IT AND CALLS IT A PARADE. I KNEW THERE WERE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO GET THE BUDGET BALANCED. JUST SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GIVE. YOU HAVE TO YOURSELF IN THE SHOES OF THE OTHER PERSON, TOO. WE FUNDAMENTALLY KNOW WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE GOVERNMENT. WE NEED LESS GOVERNMENT. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO REFORM THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. IT CAN'T ALL BE OUR WAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIX SOCIAL SECURITY. THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE THINGS WE KNOW ARE ON THE TABLE -- AFFECTING EARLY RETIREMENT, DO YOU RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGE? DO YOU LINK THE PAYMENTS AND HOW MUCH YOU GET OUT? DO YOU GO TO WHICH TO FIX IT. I HAVE NOT TALKED TO DICK ABOUT WHAT HE THINGS ABOUT IT, BUT IF I'M GOING TO FIX SOCIAL SECURITY AND I THINK I'M GOING TO SHOVE A REPUBLICAN PLAN THROUGH AN HE IS GOING TO SAY IT IS OUTRAGEOUS, IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK. WE HAVE TO MEASURE. WE HAVE TO REALIZE WHEN PEOPLE CAN SAY TO THEMSELVES, I'M HERE TO SERVE THE COUNTRY AND NOT ME, YOU GET AN ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH YOUR OWN STRONG FEELINGS FROM THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE. SOMEHOW WE GOT PEOPLE TO SAY, HELL, NO, I'M NOT CHANGING ON THIS. WHERE DO WE END UP? UNABLE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. SOMETIMES IT IS NO, BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE KNOW THAT OFTEN. EXCEPT WHEN I HAVE TO DEAL WITH BY ALMOST 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTERS. [LAUGHTER] BOY, IS THAT A HARD ONE FOR ME. I HAVE TO COMPROMISE THINGS, BUT THAT IS BECAUSE MY WIFE -- SHE KNOWS A LOT BETTER ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO THAN I DO, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. SHE IS INCREDIBLE. [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, >> GOVERNOR, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PRESIDENT. IN ORDER TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO WIN THE NOMINATION. THERE IS A GUY NOW WHO IS A FRONT RUNNER WHO IS SHOOTING HIS MOUTH OFF, AND HE IS DOING THAT BECAUSE OF THE THINGS HE IS PROPOSING. I HAVE HEARD ON FOX NEWS AND SOME OTHER STATION THAT I HAVE HEARD THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, AND I HAVE HEARD YOU A FEW TIMES, AND YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT RECORD IN OHIO. I THINK THIS GREAT. I THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT, AND I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW IT IS SO IMPORTANT, THIS COUNTRY IS IN SUCH BAD SHAPE, THAT WE NEED SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, YOU GOT TO WIN THE NOMINATION. OTHERWISE YOU CANNOT BE PRESIDENT. SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SHAKING UP WHAT IS GOING ON. MANY SOME OF THE PROPOSALS, SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO, THEY ARE GOOD THINGS, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE IT -- I DO NOT KNOW -- THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PROCESS. NATIONAL POLLS DO NOT MEAN THAT MUCH. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU BUILD A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU BUILD A HOUSE. DO YOU PUT THE TOP FLOOR OF THE HOUSE ON WITH A COUPLE SPINDLY POSTS SO THAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THE WIND BLOWS THE HOUSE COLLAPSES, OR DU BUILD THE HOUSE FROM THE FOUNDATION UP? IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THIS IS MY 19TH OR 20TH TOWN HALL MEETING, AND I HOPE SOME OF YOU SIGN UP. IF YOU SIGN UP, WE ARE BUILDING IT FROM THE GROUND UP. SO SOME OF IT IS TRUE IN IOWA, TRUE IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND IT IS HARD WORK, AND YOU CANNOT PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE FLASH AND -- OUT THERE. I WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO GET YOUR VOTE. THEN I WOULD NOT BE TRUE TO MYSELF. I AM GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN AS BEST AS I CAN, RAISING THE BAR ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE AND ALL THAT, THEN LOWERING THE BAR, BECAUSE I WILL GIVE YOU A PLAN, AN IDEA. ONE OF THE PEOPLE, WITHOUT MENTIONING HIS NAME, CAME UP WITH A TAX PLAN. IT PUTS US $11 TRILLION IN THE HOLE WITH NO WAY TO PAY FOR IT. OK? THAT WILL BE KNOWN OVER TIME, I THINK. RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE ""AMERICAN IDOL"" QUARTERFINALS, AND ULTIMATELY IT GETS DOWN FEWER. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, SIR, AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT I HAVE DONE, THAT A LOT OF THE THINGS I AM FOUR, WHICH I HAVE OUTLINED HERE AND WE WILL DO IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT IS I WOULD LIKE TO DO. BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. YES, SIR, RIGHT HERE. >> YOU HAVE SEEN THE WHITE HOUSE -- CAN YOU TAKE A PIECE OF THE NO SPIN ZONE. GOVERNOR KASICH: YOU WANT TO COME DOWN WHEN I WIN? I WILL GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES. SENATOR GORDON HUMPHREY'S IS HERE. IF YOU ALL RECOGNIZE HIM. HE IS A GREAT ONE. >> TRUTHFUL TALK? GOVERNOR KASICH: YOU HEARD ME ABOUT LONG ENOUGH. HAVEN'T I BEEN PLAN ENOUGH? HERE'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT -- I LEARNED THIS WHEN I GOT TO BE GOVERNOR MORE THAN WHEN I WAS A CONGRESSMAN. LEADERS -- YOU KNOW, TONE BATTERS A LOT. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE YELLING AND SCREAMING AND POUNDING AND DIVIDING. YOU WANT TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK NEED -- WE NEED MOST IN THIS COUNTRY IS READ NIGHT THE CITIZENSHIP, WHERE WE WORRY AND STRENGTHEN OUR FAMILIES. ISN'T THAT WHAT MATTERS IN OUR COUNTRY, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS NOT GREAT FROM THE TOP DOWN, IT IS GOOD FROM THE BOTTOM UP. I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING WEAK OR CONFUSING. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VIEWED UNTIL NOW STRONG. EARLY IN MY CAREER, WHEN I GOT ELECTED GOVERNOR, IT IS FUNNY HOW THINGS TURN. I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK TO A GROUP OF LOBBYISTS, SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. SO I GOT UP AND I SET WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF CHANGE HERE IN OHIO, AND YOU REPRESENT A LOVING GROUPS THAT ARE GOING TO FIGHT CHANGE. LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU, YOU USER GET ON THE BUS OR WE WILL RUN YOU OVER WITH A BUS, OK? THAT IS DIRECT. THE MEDIA WENT AND DISTORTED IT LIKE I WAS TALKING TO THE PEOPLE. I WAS NOT TALKING TO THE PEOPLE, I WAS TALKING TO THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS EVER GOING TO STANDING IN THE WAY OF WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO FIX OUR PRECIOUS DID OF OHIO. SOME OF THEM, WE HAD TO RUN OVER THE BUS, BUT WE GOT THE BUDGET BALANCED, GROWN JOBS, AND PEOPLE ALL AR HORRIBLE. E I 186 OUT OF 88 COUNTIES. I HADWON A COUNTY THAT ROCK OBAMA WON BY BASHING THAT BARACK OBAMA WON BY 46 POINTS. WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THOSE TWO COUNTIES. NO, WE'RE NOT. BUT I THINK IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE ARE STRONGER ECONOMICALLY AND BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE INCLUDED,, SIR AND I WANT TO CREATE MENTORSHIP SO THAT WE AS ADULTS ARE HELPING OUR CHILDREN TO BE STRONGER AND BETTER AND HOPEFUL AND BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES. WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE HERE IN BOW AND IN WESTERVILLE, AND WE HAVE TO BEAT THE SCOURGE OF DRUG ABUSE BY FIGHTING FOR OUR KIDS. I TALK TO SOMEBODY THIS MORNING, AND EVERYBODY I TALKED TO A GUY THIS MORNING, EVERYBODY GOES NUTS. I TALKED TO A GUY, HIS SON GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, HE GOT ON ECSTASY, THE DRUG. THEY SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR THIS, THEIR SON, 21 YEARS OLD, ALL OF AMERICA, IN HOMELESS SHELTERS. THEY FOUND HIS REMAINS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE HAD BEEN HIT BY A CAR, KILLED, AND THEY FOUND HIS REMAINS AM A 21 YEARS OLD. THIS GUY AM TALKING TO THIS MORNING, HE SAYS I WANT TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE. I DO NOT EVEN KNOW THIS GUY. HE TOOK ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND HE SHOULD BE A PICTURE OF HIS SON, AND THEN HE SHOWED ME A BAG OF REFILLS HE NEEDS FOR HIS WIFE WHO HAD A BREAKDOWN WHEN THEY FOUND HIS SON. WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP THEM. THAT IS NOT BEING PRESIDENT OR GOVERNOR OR ANYTHING ELSE. WE ARE ON THAT, AREN'T WE? TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN AMERICA, HELP ONE ANOTHER. JUST DO NOT BE POLARIZED. LOVE ONE ANOTHER, STAND UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE, THE WEEKEND DO ALL THIS. SO THAT IS WHY I WANT TO BE A GOOD LEADER. I CAN TAKE ONE MORE, AND THEN I HAVE TO GO. I HAVE SO MANY MORE MILES TO GO BEFORE I SLEEP. YES, I SHOULD WRITE TO THAT AS A POEM. >> THANK YOU FOR COMING. THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THIS GOVERNMENT HAS PUT MORE PEOPLE OUT OF WORK, PUT THEM ON MEDICARE, MEDICAID, FREE PHONES, FREE THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER, AND I THINK IT HAS DAMAGED OUR COUNTRY A LOT. ANY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO WORK FOR A LIVING. GOVERNOR KASICH: MY MOTHER HAD A GREAT MOTTO, AND I FOLLOW IT. IT IS PRACTICAL. IT IS A SIN NOT TO HELP CEMENT HE NEEDS HELP, BUT IS EQUALLY A SIN TO CONTINUE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO NEED TO LEARN HOW TO HELP THEMSELVES. WHEN WE HELP ABLE, WE WANT TO DEMAND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE SCRAPING AND WORKING TO GET BY NOBODY BEGRUDGE HIS HELP TO SOMEBODY WHO REALLY NEEDS IT, BUT YOU CANNOT GO ON FOREVER. WE NEED TO HELP THEM GET UP AND TO GET WALKING AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND BECOME GOOD ROLE MODELS FOR THEIR KIDS. SOME PEOPLE IT IS HARDER TO HELP THAN OTHERS. I JUST GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU GROW UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU WILL NOT SEE IT IN BOW, BUT IN SOME OF OUR AREAS, INCLUDING OHIO, THERE ARE KIDS THAT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND ALL THEY HEAR OUR GUNSHOTS. THESE ARE KIDS WE GOT TO HELP, GET THEM ON THEIR FEET. EVERYBODY IS MADE IN THE ENGINE IMAGE OF THE LORD -- EVERYBODY IS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF THE LORD. DO NOT ASK FOR SOMETHING BACK. IN MY STATE, IF YOU GET FOOD STAMPS, YOU GOT TO WORK 20 HOURS A WEEK. UNLESS IT IS A HIGH AREA OF UNEMPLOYMENT, IF YOU ARE EXCEPTIONS TO IT, BUT YOU ARE ABLE-BODIED, YOU GOT TO DO SOME WORK FOR IT. SOME OF THE GROUPS WHO ARE MY FRIENDS DO NOT LIKE IT. THEY THINK THAT IS HARSH. I DO NOT THINK IT IS HARSH AT ALL. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING FOR WHAT YOU GET FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. SO ANYWAY, I THINK IT IS A MIXTURE. HERE IS THE THING -- I WOULD NOT WELFARE TO BE RUN BASICALLY IN THE STATES, SO YOUR VALUES CAN RUN THE WELFARE PROGRAM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND OUR VALUES IN THE BUCKEYE STATE CAN BE THERE. LET'S FORGET THIS ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE POWER TO SHAPE A LOT OF THINGS WHERE THEY LIVE, FROM THE BOTTOM-UP UP, RATHER THAN THE TOP DOWN. SO NICE TO BE HERE. I HAVE TO GO. AND I HOPE THAT YOU CAN SIGN UP, SO THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2015] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, CALLER:WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

SEE YOU. >> TAKE YOU OUTSIDE FOR A LOOK NEAR THE TOUR BUS OF JOHN KASICH AS HE CONTINUES HIS CAMPAIGN OUTSIDE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. GOVERNOR KASICH: THERE IS TONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO TOGETHER, AND IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN AT TIMES. I FOUND THE PARTISANSHIP IN THE STATE OF OHIO A LOT DIFFERENT WHEN I WAS IN POLITICS BEFORE I GOT OUT OF POLITICS. THERE -- IT WAS A LOT MORE CONGENIAL. IT IS GETTING BETTER IN OHIO. YESTERDAY WE HAD A FORMER LEADER WHO WAS UP HERE, HOLDING A KASI CH SIGN. IS IS AN EFFORT WHERE YOU PLUG TOGETHER ON A LOT OF THINGS. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET THEM TO VOTE FOR YOUR BUDGET. I TELL YOU, AND I FIRST STARTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WOULD IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION, NONE OF THEM LIKED IT, AND NOW THEY ARE ALL THE FATHERS OF THE IDEA, AND I HAPPEN TO BE THE CHILD THAT WENT ALONG. AND THAT IS FERVENTLY FINE WITH YOU. >> YOUR MESSAGE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS -- GOVERNOR KASICH: THE UNANIMOUS VOTE OF FIGHTING DRUG ABUSE IN OUR STATE. >> YOUR MESSAGE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS? GOVERNOR KASICH: HAVE FUN. I WILL ROLL OUT A PLAN ON THURSDAY. IT WILL BE A PROGRAM THAT I WILL SAY THAT PEOPLE I WILL TRY TO AN ACT IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS, AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER ADVICE -- >> IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO REACH ACROSS THE AISLE. GOVERNOR KASICH: EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO IT. >> ONE QUESTIONER RAISED THE ISSUE OF HOW DO YOU GET YOUR NAME OUT AGAIN. YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR MONTHS. YOU WERE UP IN THE POLLS. MAYBE SLID BACK A LITTLE BIT. GOVERNOR KASICH: WE HAVE OUR OWN POLLS. WE ARE DOING FINE. WE HAVE A HIGH POSITIVE, LOW NEGATIVE, AND WE ARE BUILDING A VERY GOOD BASE. NEARLY GREAT ORGANIZATION. WE ARE DOING BETTER IN IOWA. IT IS ABOUT BUILDING A HOUSE FROM THE BOTTOM UP. WHEN I RAN FOR THE STATE SENATE IT IN THE STATE OF OHIO, A WEEKEND BEFORE THE ELECTION, A POLLS THAT I WOULD LOSE. I ENDED UP WINNING 56 PERCENT OF THE NET. YOU CANNOT ALWAYS SEE THINGS FROM THE GROUND UP. YOU DO NOT WIN IT WITH COALS OR NAME IDEA. YOU WIN IT FROM THE BOTTOM UP, JUST LIKE WE OUGHT TO RUN AMERICA. THANK YOU. SEE YOU. WHAT TIME ARE THE SCORPIONS COMING ONTO THE BUS? >> ARE YOU GUYS READY? >> YES. >> JOHN KASICH APPEARING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE APPEARED YESTERDAY IN THE NODE LABELS CONFERENCE, WHICH WE WILL BE SHOWING YOU. WE WILL HAVE THE TOWN HALL AGAIN AT 8:00",2015-11-07 18:04:44,2015-10-13,Bow,New Hampshire
http://www.c-span.org/video/?328831-1/carly-fiorina-town-hall-meeting-beaufort-south-carolina,"Carly Fiorina Town Hall Meeting in Beaufort, South Carolina",Carly Fiorina,"ANNOUNCER: REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE CARLY FIORINA WAS IN SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY FOR A TOWN HALL EVENT, WHERE SHE ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM HER SUPPORTERS. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY, PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS, AND HILLARY CLINTON'S TESTIMONY BEFORE THE HOUSE BENGHAZI COMMITTEE. IT WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA'S SATELLITE CAMPUS IN BEFORE. -- IN BEAUFORT. [APPLAUSE] MS. FIORINA: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION, AND THANK YOU, CHILDREN, FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE THAT YOU DID SO WELL. HOW MANY OF YOU WATCHED THE BENGHAZI HEARINGS A LITTLE BIT? SO, OF COURSE, HILLARY CLINTON CONTINUES NOT TO ANSWER THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, WHICH IS, SINCE SHE CLEARLY KNEW THAT THIS WAS A PURPOSEFUL TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE NIGHT IT WAS GOING ON, WHY DID SHE GET UP THE NEXT DAY AND ADDRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TALK ABOUT A VIDEOTAPE THAT DID NOT REPRESENT OUR VALUES, AND WHY DID SHE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT FOR MANY DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME? IN A WAY, I THINK THOSE HEARINGS AS ADMIRABLE A JOB AS TRADE DOWDY DID -- TREY GOWDY DID. AS ADMIRABLE A JOB HE HAS DONE, IT IS CLEAR THAT MRS. CLINTON WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HER ACTIONS THERE OR ELSEWHERE. UNTIL AND UNLESS WE HAVE A NOMINEE THAT IS PREPARED TO HOLD HER TO ACCOUNT DURING A GENERAL ELECTION DEBATE. [APPLAUSE] MS. FIORINA: MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVEN'T QUITE DECIDED IF YOU ARE READY TO SUPPORT ME OR NOT, BUT EVERYONE OF YOU I KNOW IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS CANNOT WAIT TO SEE ME DEBATE HILLARY CLINTON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MS. FIORINA: AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THAT HAPPENS, FOLKS. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY. I DO OCCASIONALLY FEEL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EMPATHY FOR HILLARY CLINTON, AS I HAVE SAID PUBLICLY ON OTHER OCCASIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS A WOMAN. FOR EXAMPLE, EARLY ON IN MY CAMPAIGN, I WAS ASKED ON A SATURDAY MORNING TELEVISION SHOW WHETHER I THOUGHT THAT A WOMAN'S HORMONES PREVENTER FROM SERVING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. [LAUGHTER] MS. FIORINA: MY ANSWER WAS, GEE, CAN WE THINK OF A SINGLE INSTANCE IN WHICH A MAN'S JUDGMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLOUDED BY HIS HORMONES? [LAUGHTER] MS. FIORINA: THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND I, AND ONE OF THE MEN'S ONES -- ONE OF THE MAIN ONES IS THIS. I WILL NEVER ASK FOR YOUR VOTE BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN, ALTHOUGH I AM PROUD TO BE ONE. I WILL ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND PRAYERS, BECAUSE I BELIEVE I AM THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE TO WIN THIS JOB AND DO THIS JOB. [APPLAUSE] MS. FIORINA: WHEN I LAUNCHED MY CANDIDACY, HONESTLY, NOBODY GAVE ME A CHANCE. MOST VOTERS HAD NEVER HEARD OF ME, I HAD NEVER HELD OFFICE, NOBODY GAVE ME A CHANCE. I REMINDED GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS THIS MORNING ON GOOD MORNING AMERICA OF THAT, BECAUSE I WAS ON HIS SHOW THE DAY I ANNOUNCED. DURING THE AUGUST 6 DEBATE, I WAS NOT EVEN ON THE MAIN STAGE. AT THE CNN DEBATE IN SEPTEMBER, I HAD TO FIGHT MY WAY ON STAGE. BY THE WAY, MANY OF YOU HELPED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] MS. FIORINA: IN THE DEBATE NEXT WEEK, I AM NUMBER FOUR, SO I AM FEELING PRETTY GOOD. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. [APPLAUSE] MS. FIORINA: BUT THE TRUTH IS, I AM STILL INTRODUCING MYSELF TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT IS TRUE THAT NEXT WEEK DURING THAT DEBATE, 40% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS DON'T KNOW WHO I AM, AND THEY STILL DON'T KNOW I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. ALLOW ME TO TAKE A MOMENT IF I MAY, BEFORE I TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE AT OUR NATION, TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. I WON'T MAKE THIS TOO LONG, BUT I MUST START WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. I WAS IN CHURCH ON A SUNDAY MORNING. THE MOTHER WAS MY SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER, AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID TO ME AND THE REST OF MY SUNDAY SCHOOL STUDENTS, WHAT YOU ARE IS GOD'S GIFT TO YOU, WHAT YOU MAKE TO YOURSELF IS YOUR GIFT TO GOD. THOSE WORDS HAVE STAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE, PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THAT LITTLE GIRL, OR EVEN AS A YOUNG WOMAN -- I DIDN'T FEEL PARTICULARLY GIFTED -- AND HER WORDS WERE A PROMISE THAT I HAVE GIFTS AND HAVE A CHALLENGE TO FIND AND USE THOSE. I ADORE MY FATHER AND I WOULD SIT AT HIS KNEES AND WATCH AND WATCH THE NEWS EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM WORK. I WOULD WATCH HIM YELL AT WALTER CRONKITE. AND I WOULD ASK HIM, WHY? AND HE WOULD EXPLAIN. AND THE NEXT MORNING, I WOULD SIT AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND WATCH HIM YELL AT THE NEW YORK TIMES. I WOULD ASK HIM WHY. FROM BOTH MY MOTHER AND FATHER, I LEARNED THAT THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HARD WORK, THERE IS DIGNITY AND ALL WORK IS DONE WITH EXCELLENCE. THAT FAMILY BRINGS PURPOSE TO OUR LIVES AND FAITH BRINGS MEANING. THAT VALUES ARE WHAT GUIDES YOUR BEHAVIOR WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING. AND THAT IN THE END, EUROPE YOU TATIAN INTEGRITY ARE THE MOST PRECIOUS ASSETS YOU HAVE -- YOUR REPUTATION AND INTEGRITY ARE THE MOST PRECIOUS ASSETS YOU HAVE. I WOULD START MY CAREER IN A DEEP RECESSION, TYPING AND ANSWERING PHONES FOR A SMALL REAL ESTATE FIRM. ONE DAY, TWO MEN WANT TO -- WALKED TO MY DESK, AND THEY SAID, WE HAVE BEEN WASHING YOU -- WATCHING YOU, AND WE THINK YOU CAN DO MORE THAN TYPE AND FILE. THAT WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO MOTHER -- TO THE BUSINESS. I WOULD GO ON AND WORK AT AT&T. I STARTED IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WHEN AT&T USED TO BE A MILLION EMPLOYEES, AND IT WAS THERE WERE A HAD -- WHERE I MET MY HUSBAND, FRANK. HE BROUGHT TOGETHER TWO LITTLE GIRLS. THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER ENORMOUS -- BEN AND ENORMOUS BLESSING. -- BENEN AN ENORMOUS BLESSING. WE HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED, FREIGHT AND I. WE HAVE HAD GOOD TIMES AND HARD TIMES. YOU HEARD FROM SHANNON, I BATTLED CANCER. THE POWER OF MY FATE SAW ME THROUGH THAT. MY FATE SAW US THROUGH THE TOUGH TIMES OF BEARING I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD. I HAVE LIVED COME WORK, TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD. I AM KEENLY AWARE THAT IT IS ONLY IN THIS NATION THAT A YOUNG WOMAN CAN START OUT THE WAY I DID, IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEEP RECESSION TYPING AND FILING, GO ON ONE DAY TO BECOME THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WHAT WE TURNED INTO THE LARGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE WORLD. AND RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE HERE. [APPLAUSE] AND I THINK IT IS WORTH ASKING WHY. THE WHY. THE REASON MORE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH. BECAUSE I THINK IT IS FORGETTING THE WHY THAT WE GO THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND I THINK OUR NATION IS IN A PIVOTAL POINT. MY MOTHER WAS RIGHT. EVERYBODY HAS GIFTS. EVERYONE HAS POTENTIAL, FAR MORE THAN THEY REALIZE. AND YET, MORE THINGS HAVE BEEN MORE POSSIBLE FOR MORE PEOPLE HERE BECAUSE OUR FOUNDERS KNEW WHAT MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME. OUR FOUNDERS KNEW THAT EVERYONE HAS POTENTIAL, GOD-GIVEN GIFTS. AND IN THIS NATION, YOU HAVE A RIGHT -- IT WAS QUITE A RADICAL IDEA THE TIME -- A RIGHT TO THE FILL YOUR POTENTIAL, THE USE YOUR GIFT. IT IS WHAT THEY MEANT WHEN THEY SAID THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. AND THE REALLY RADICAL PART OF THEIR IDEA, WHICH FOUNDED A NATION, WAS THAT THIS RIGHT TO FULFILL YOUR POTENTIAL -- TO USE YOUR GOD-GIVEN GIFTS -- COMES FROM GOD. THEY CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY BY MAN OR GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] I STARTED ON THE JOURNEY OF CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHEN IRAN INTO A MAN AFTER SPEECH I HAD GIVEN -- WHEN I RAN INTO A MAN AFTER SPEECH I HAD GIVEN. HE SAID, YOU KNOW CARLY, WE DON'T THINK OF OURSELVES AS A NATION OF LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES ANYMORE. THAT REALLY LANDED. BECAUSE WHEN WE DO NOT THINK OF OURSELVES THAT WAY, WE ARE LOSING THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE. WE USED TO KNOW THAT IF SOMETHING WERE WORTH DOING, WE WOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. IF IT WERE HARD TO DO, EVEN BETTER. WE WOULD PULL TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE. WE JUST KNEW THAT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN'S LIVE WS WERE FILLED WITH GREAT POSSIBILITY. WE DOUBT THAT NOW. THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE THE POSSIBILITY FOR AMERICANS -- THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS GREAT NATION -- ARE BEING CRUSHED A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS GROWN SO BIG, SO POWERFUL, SO COSTLY, SO COMPLICATED, SO IN APT, AND -- SISO INEPT. IN A COUNTRY THAT REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] THOSE ARE REALLY HARSH WORDS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. BUT THEY ARE WHAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS BELIEVE. AMERICANS ARE SMART. AS CITIZENS, WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG NOW. AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN REPLACING A D WITH AN R. THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE. 75% OF AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK THE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT. 82% NOW THINK WE HAVE A PROFESSIONAL POLITICAL CLASS THAT CARES MORE ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF ITS OWN POWER, POSITION, AND PRIVILEGE THAN GETTING ANYTHING DONE. AND I AGREE. MY FELLOW CITIZENS, I THINK IT IS TIME TO REMEMBER THAT WE WERE INTENDED TO BE A CITIZEN GOVERNMENT AND TO TAKE OUR GOVERNMENT BACK. [APPLAUSE] AND WE NEED TO TAKE OUR GOVERNMENT BACK BECAUSE WE HAVE FESTERING PROBLEMS THAT NEVER GETS ALL. PEOPLE SOLVED. AND NEVER REALLY GETS BETTER. WE STILL ARE NOT CARING FOR OUR VETERANS, THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED US. HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TAX REFORM? REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT? SECURING THE BORDER? HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE? GOVERNMENT HAS GOTTEN BIGGER AND MORE COMPLICATED, MORE POWERFUL, MORE CORRUPT EVERY YEAR FOR 50 YEARS. SO YOU SEE, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT AN R FOR A D. IT IS ABOUT PUTTING SOMEONE IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO, AND WHO HAS A TRACK RECORD OF PRODUCING RESULTS IN SOLVING PROBLEMS. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY. SOME OF THEM ARE POLITICIANS. POLITICIANS ARE BAD PEOPLE NECESSARILY. BUT A LOT OF POLITICIANS ARE MANAGERS, NOT LEADERS. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANAGERS AND LEADERS. MANAGERS ARE PEOPLE WHO DO THE BEST THEY CAN WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM. THEY NEVER REALLY CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. THEY OPERATE WITHIN THE SYSTEM, EVEN IF IT IS BROKEN. AND BECAUSE THEY OPERATE WITHIN THE SYSTEM, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIX THE SYSTEM, THE KIND OF TINKER AROUND THE EDGES OF THE PROBLEMS. LEADERS ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THEY SAY I AM NOT GOING TO ACCEPT A SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS BROKEN. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS THEIR JOB TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. A LEADER'S HIGHEST CALLING ALWAYS IS SERVICE TO OTHERS. IT IS ALWAYS TO UNLOCK POTENTIAL AND OTHERS. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT HAPPENS IS TO ACTUALLY CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO, SOLVE PROBLEMS, REDUCE RESULTS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING MARGARET THATCHER ONCE SAID. I ADMIRE HER GREATLY. SHE ONCE SAID AT A PIVOTAL POINT IN THAT NATION'S HISTORY, ""I AM NOT CONTENT TO MANAGE THE DECLINE OF A GREAT CIVILIZATION."" I THINK WE HAVE BEEN MANAGING THE DECLINE OF THIS GREAT NATION FOR QUITE LONG ENOUGH. [APPLAUSE] I AM PREPARED, THOUGH. WITH YOUR VOTES AND YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR PRAYERS, TO LEAD THE RESURGENCE OF A GREAT NATION. [APPLAUSE] WHAT IS IT WE NEED TO DO? WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. IN ORDER TO GET OUR ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN, WE HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS. AND QUIT PROTECTING BIG BUSINESS. THE BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL GOVERNMENT GETS, THE MORE POWERFUL THE WEALTHY AND WELL-CONNECTED GET. IT IS CALLED CRONY CAPITALISM. PROGRESSIVES WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GET OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS GROWING AGAIN. WE NEED TO QUIT INTERDEPENDENCE. AND WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE, INDEED REQUIRE, THAT PEOPLE GO TO WORK. BECAUSE DIGNITY AND PURPOSE COME FROM WORK. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO REFORM THE TAX CODE, QUIT TALKING ABOUT IT AND DO IT. 73,000 PAGES TO 3. THAT IS THE QUESTION. IF SOMETHING IS SO COLLOCATED THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT, WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE YOU ARE GETTING TAKING ADVANTAGE OF? 100%. UNLESS YOU HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES, YOU ARE GETTING TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. WE KNOW THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO KNOW WHERE YOUR MONEY IS BEING SPENT. WE HAVE TO GO TO SOME ZERO-BASED BUDGETING. WHEN THAT BE HELPFUL? TO ACTUALLY KNOW -- [APPLAUSE] ASTERISK, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT EVERY YEAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE MONEY AND YET NEVER HAS ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THE IMPORTANT THINGS. YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA VETOES THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT. HERE IS A DANGEROUS TIME IN OUR WORLD, AND BASICALLY WHAT HE SAYS IS, WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. NOT FOR MY PRIORITY. HOW IS IT THAT WE ALWAYS SPEND MORE MONEY AND NEVER HAVE ENOUGH? IT IS ALWAYS SPOKEN FOR. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO GO TO A SYSTEM WHERE EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR HAS TO BE JUSTIFIED EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THE ONLY WAY YOU SPEND LESS OVERALL AND PRIORITIZE WHAT YOU SPEND. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IN GOVERNMENT. NO ONE IS EVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND GOVERNMENT. NOT MRS. CLINTON, NOT BE SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE V.A. WHO PERMIT OVER 300,000 VETERANS TO DIE, NOT THE PEOPLE IN THE IRS TO TARGET CONSERVATIVES. NO ONE IS EVER HELD TO ACCOUNT. AND WE HAVE TO MOVE TO A SYSTEM WHERE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES. [APPLAUSE] AND WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE TO LEAD IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO GET OUR ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN. WE HAVE TO CUT GOVERNMENT DOWN TO SIZE AND HOLD IT ACCOUNTABLE, AND WE HAVE TO LEAD IN THE WORLD. WHICH MEANS THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS, THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED US, BECAUSE WHEN WE DO NOT CARE FOR THEM IT IS A STAIN ON OUR HONOR. BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE FEEL AS THOUGH MILITARY SERVICE IS NO LONGER HONORED AND VALUED. WE HAVE A HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY ON THE PLANET. EVERYBODY HAS TO KNOW IT. [APPLAUSE] AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO SEND A SIGNAL, A REALLY POWERFUL SIGNAL , TO THE WORLD THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL LEAD AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND ON DAY ONE IN THE OVAL OFFICE, I WILL MAKE TWO PHONE CALLS. I WILL CALL NETANYAHU AND TELL HIM THAT WE WILL STAND WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL. ALWAYS. [APPLAUSE] AND THE SECOND WILL BE TO THE SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN. WHO MIGHT NOT TAKE MY CALL. [LAUGHTER] BUT HE WILL GET MY MESSAGE. AND THE MESSAGE IS, NEW DEAL. [APPLAUSE] UNTIL YOU OPEN EVERY MILITARY AND EVERY NUCLEAR FACILITY ANYTIME TO ANYWHERE INSPECTIONS, WE WILL MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO MOVE MONEY AROUND THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM. WE CAN DO THAT. WE DON'T NEED PERMISSION TO DO THAT. AND WE MUST DO IT. BECAUSE THE MONEY, THE MONEY IS BEING USED TO BUILD MILITARY CAPABILITY, NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY, AND TO SEW MURDER AND MAYHEM THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. WITH THOSE TWO PHONE CALLS, THE MESSAGE WILL GO OUT AROUND THE WORLD LOUD AND CLEAR. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS BACK IN THE LEADERSHIP BUSINESS. [APPLAUSE] I AM WANT TO FINISH UP HERE IN A MINUTE SO I CAN TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE MUST WHEN IN 2016 -- WIN IN 2016. [APPLAUSE] SO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHO CAN WIN. I HAVE BEEN TESTED. AND I WILL NOT FALTER, AND I WILL NOT SHRINK FROM THIS FIGHT, AND IT WILL BE A FIGHT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO DO THE JOB. BECAUSE THE JOB NEEDS DOING NOW. AND TO DO THE JOB, IT REQUIRES A LEADER TO UNDERSTANDS H HOW THE ECONOMY WORKS. SO WE CAN GET GOING AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED A LEADER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE WORLD WORKS, AND WHO IS IN THE WORLD? AND WHAT OUR ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES EXPECT AND NEED FROM US. THAT IS WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME -- A GIANT, BLOATED, CORRUPT BUREAUCRACY. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO REENGAGE CITIZENS ONCE AGAIN. IT IS A TOOL I WILL USE. BUT IT IS BEING USED AGAINST US. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT LEADERSHIP IS. ALL OF THOSE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A RECEPTIONIST, I THOUGHT THE LEADER -- A LEADER -- WAS SOMEONE WITH A BIG OFFICE AND A BIG PARKING SPACE. A BUNCH OF PERKS. AND I REALIZED THERE WERE PEOPLE WITH BIG TITLES WERE NOT LEADING AT ALL. LEADERSHIP IS NOT ABOUT THOSE THINGS. IT IS NOT ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR OFFICE, AIRPLANE, EGO. IT IS ABOUT CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO. LEADERSHIP -- [APPLAUSE] LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT SOLVING PROBLEMS AND PRODUCING RESULTS. LEADERSHIP IN SERVICE TO OTHERS. AND THE HIGHEST CALLING OF LEADERSHIP IS TO UNLOCK POTENTIAL AND OTHERS. WE NOW NEED A LEADER WHO WILL UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY AMERICAN AND OF THIS NATION. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [APPLAUSE] QUESTIONS? YES, SIR. >> YOU MENTIONED CRONY CAPITALISM. I KNOW IT IS COMPLICATED. BE AND ADM -- THE FARMING INDUSTRY TAKES AWAY. ON THE OTHER SIDE, I DON'T KNOW WITH RESPECT TO, BUT HOW DO YOU COMBAT SOMETHING LIKE CRONY CAPITALISM? AND ALSO, IS IT TRUE THAT YOU SUPPORT CORPORATE WELFARE? CARLY FIORINA: DEMOCRATS ARE WORSE. WE HAVE DONE IT, TOO. THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT CRONY CAPITALISM. FIRST OF ALL, I UNDERSTAND REALLY WELL. A NINE PERSON REAL ESTATE COMPANY CANNOT UNDERSTAND GOVERNMENT. A 90,000 INDUSTRY CAN. MY HUSBAND FRANK AND I HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE. WE CAN HIRE AN ACCOUNTANT. MY HUSBAND STARTED OUT AS A TOW TRUCK DRIVER. THEY CANNOT HANDLE IT. THIS IS THE TRUTH WE MUST TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BECAUSE THE PROGRESSIVES WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT IS THEY THAT CARE ABOUT THE SMALL AND THE POWER LESS. BUT IN TRUTH, THE IMPACT AND CONSEQUENCE OF EVERY ONE OF THEIR POLICIES IS TO CRUSH THE SMALL AND THE POWERLESS. WHY? BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOME THING IS BIG, A C COMPLICATED, YET TO BE BIG, WEALTHY, AND COMPLICATED TO DEAL WITH IT. MOORE, DATED THE TAX CODE GETS, IT IS TRUE THAT ONLY THE BIG CAN DEAL WITH IT. REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF THIS, YES. THERE ARE A LOT OF CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO SUPPORT SUBSIDIES OF VARIOUS KINDS. SUBSIDIES, TAX CREDITS. I DO NOT. I HAVE BEEN VERY HONEST. I HAVE GONE TO IOWA AND SAID I KNOW IT MATTERS A LOT TO YOU TO HAVE RENEWABLE -- IE RESOURCES. I SUPPORT THAT LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. BUT BY 2020, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF SETTING PRICES, GUARANTEEING CRISIS PRICES TO MARKETS. ITLET US GIVE EVERYONE A WINDOW TO GET PREPARED. BUT THE ONLY WAY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN SMALL AND POWERLESS, AND BIG AND POWERFUL, IS TO SIMPLIFY GOVERNMENT DRAMATICALLY. SIMPLIFY THE TAX CODE, HACK THROUGH THE REGULATORY THC ICKET AND GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND THAT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS WHY CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO IS HARD. GUESS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS? WHEN YOU SAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BUSINESS OF PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS? EVERYBODY THAT HAS BENEFITED FROM THAT STATUS QUO RUSHES INTO PROTECTED. IT IS HUMAN NATURE. IT IS WHY CHANGE IS ALWAYS HARD. THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE STATUS QUO. COMPANIES,, INDIVIDUALS, SPECIAL INTERESTS -- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE GROUPS WILL COME IN TO PROTECT WHAT THEY HAVE. WHICH IS WHY THE POWER OF CITIZENSHIP IS SO IMPORTANT. OURS WAS INTENDED TO BE A CITIZEN GOVERNMENT. WE CANNOT TAKE OUR GOVERNMENT BACK UNLESS, AS CITIZENS, WE ARE PREPARED TO PARTICIPATE. LIMIT IS USER QUESTION TO SAY THIS -- I'M GOING TO ASK LET ME USE YOUR QUESTION TO SAY THIS. ONCE A WEEK, I WILL GO INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. THE PRESIDENT HAS A WEEKLY RADIO ADDRESS. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE UP OUROUT YOUR SMARTPHONE. ANYBODY STILL USE A FLIP PHONE? [LAUGHTER] YOU HAVE ABOUT 18 MONTHS, START SHOPPING. I WILL GO INTO MY OFFICE AND ASK CITIZENS TO TAKE OUT THEIR SMARTPHONES. DO YOU THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW WHERE YOUR MONEY IS BEING SPENT? TO GO TO SOMEWHERE NEAR ZERO-BASED BUDGET. PRESS 1 FOR YES. DO YOU THINK THAT INSTEAD OF A 73,000 PAGE TAX CODE, MAYBE IT SHOULD BE 3. PRESS 2 FOR NO. AFTER 50 YEARS OF NOT DOING SO, OUTGHTSHOULD WE ROLL IT BACK? PRESS 1 FOR YES, 2 FOR NO. BY THE WAY, I KNOW THAT A BUNCH OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE SITTING IN THEIR SAYING ""!"" ""1!"" IT MEANS WE FOUND COMMON GROUND BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, MEN AND WOMEN, YOUNG AND OLD. 75% IS A HUGE MAJORITY. WE CAN GOVERN DIFFERENTLY. ONE LAST THING ON THIS. WHY DO I SAY I AM SO CONFIDENT? WHY DO I SAY I'M SO CONFIDENT THAT THE POLITICAL CLASS RESPONSE TO PRESSURE? BECAUSE WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF IT. I MENTIONED THE V.A. SCANDAL 18 MONTHS AGO. WHEN WE LEARNED THAT VETERANS WERE DYING BEFORE THEY GOT AN APPOINTMENT, THE BUREAUCRATS WERE COOKING THE BOOKS SO WE DO NOT FIND OUT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE SO OUTRAGED THAT CONGRESS REACTED. AND THEY PASSED A BIPARTISAN BILL IN THREE WEEKS, DEMONSTRATING THEY CAN DO SOMETHING. IN THREE WEEKS, PASSED A BILL THAT SAID WE CAN FIRE THE TOP 400 SENIOR EXECUTIVES. BY THE WAY, ONLY ONE PERSON HAS BEEN FIRED BECAUSE THE PRESSURE DO NOT STAY ON. AND THE HORRORS JUST KEEP COMING ON. IT IS A PROOF POINT. WITH CONCERTED EFFORT, THE POLITICAL PROCESS WILL MOVE. SO GO GET YOUR NEW PHONE. [LAUGHTER] YES, SIR? >> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT. [INAUDIBLE] WITH THE KINDS OF BUREAUCRACY, HOW YOU DO IT? CARLY FIORINA: IT IS HARD. SO FIRST, WE HAD NOT UNDERTAKEN A MAJOR REFORM OR ROLLBACK OF REGULATION SINCE RONALD REAGAN. THAT IS HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN. A CAN BE DONE. BUT -- IT CAN BE DONE. WE HAVE A VERITABLE THICKET OF THINGS TO DO. IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, 256,000 BABY BOOMERS WILL RETIRE OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WILL NOT REPLACE A SINGLE ONE. IT IS A WINDOW IN TIME TO MAKE A BIG MOVE. [APPLAUSE] SECOND, IF WE GO TO ZERO-BASED BUDGETING AND WE ESTABLISH THAT EVERY DOLLAR HAS TO BE JUSTIFIED, EVERY SINGLE YEAR, GUESS WHAT? THERE WILL BE A LOT OF DOLLARS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE SPENDING. WHAT DOES TECHNOLOGY PERMIT US TO DO? IT PERMITS US TO PUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE BUDGETS OUT FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE. AND THEY WILL BERE WILL BE THINGS THAT ARE OUTRAGEOUS. YOU NEED A WHOLE LOT LESS IRS AGENTS. IF YOU START TO ROLL BACK ALL OF THE EPA REGS THAT THIS DEMONSTRATION HAS PUT INTO PLACE, LADIES AND TILLMAN, WE ARE NOT A NATION OF GENTLEMEN, WHO ARE THESE ROLE MAKERS? THEY ARE BUREAUCRATS. THEY'RE NOT ELECTED BY INDIEANYO NE. WHEN WE ROLL IT BACK, AND WE MUST, WHEN WE DO A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW, WE NEED A LOT FEWER PEOPLE. AND PLEASE BE ASSURED THAT ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I WILL ASK YOU IS, DO YOU THINK THAT BILL THAT GOT PAST THAT ALLOWED US TO FIRE THE TOP 400 SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE V.A. FOR DERELICTION OF DUTY, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT PROCESS ALL TO OUT TOGHT TO APPLY? PRESS 1 FOR YES. WE GET IT DONE BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT RETIRES. BY MAKING SURE THAT AS WE SIMPLIFY AND EXAMINE GOVERNMENT, THAT WE DO NOT REPLACE. THEWE DO IT ON MAKING SURE EVERY TIME WE ROLL BACK, THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THAT ARE NO LONGER THERE. AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CONSEQUENCE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE TO SPEND MONEY ON THINGS THAT MATTER? [INAUDIBLE] CARLY FIORINA: THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT PRIORITIES. IF THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE SPENDING BUT INVEST PROPERLY, WHAT ARE THEY? TO STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY AND CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SERVED. LET ME START BY SAYING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIES NEED TO BE THOSE THINGS A ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OUR BORDERS. BECAUSE IF WE CANNOT SECURE OUR BORDERS, WE CANNOT PROTECT OUR SOVEREIGNTY. [APPLAUSE] THAT MEANS A BIG PRIORITY HAS TO BE TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND WHO IS COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND WHO IS NOT -- WHO SHOULD NOT BECOMING INTO THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO PUT A HUGE PRIORITY ON FIXING THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PROBLEM FOR 50 YEARS. WHAT IS ANOTHER RESPONSIBILITY? ROADS AND BRIDGES. GUESS WHAT? WE NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FIX THEM, WE ARE ALWAYS ASKING TAXPAYERS TO PAY MORE. WE HAVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. I WOULD NOT DO IT BY SAYING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A UNION CONTRACT TO GET THE WORK. THAT IS HOW THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT DOES IT. EDUCATION IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT PRIORITY TO THE YOUNG LADY'S QUESTION. FOR 50 YEARS, THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS GOTTEN BIGGER UNDERR REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE. IN FACT, IT HAS DETERIORATED. WE HAVE HAD GOALS OF THESE CENTRALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN LOW INCOME AND HIGH INCOME CHILDREN. AND THAT GAP IS GREATER NOW THAN IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO. WHAT CAN YOU CONCLUDE? THAT SPENDING MONEY DOES NOT HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION. WHAT DOES? [APPLAUSE] WHAT DOES? WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS. WHAT ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN A CHILD'S EDUCATION? A GOOD TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM AND AN INVOLVED PARENT DOCUMENT NUMBER, OR COMMUNITY -- INVOLVED PARENT, COMMUNITY MEMBER. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO HAVE MORE POWER AND CONTROL IN THE HANDS OF COMMUNITY AND FAMILY. WHEN WE TAKE AWAY CHOICES, WE TAKE AWAY THEIR CHANCES. THESE WONDERFUL CHILDREN WHO STOOD UP AND GAVE THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE ARE AT A CHARTER SCHOOL. THE TRUTH IS, EVERY PARENT SHOULD HAVE AS MANY CHOICES AS POSSIBLE. CHARGERS, VOUCHERS, PAROCHIAL, HOMESCHOOLING. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE A FIGHT WITH THE OTHER SIDE. BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE IS TOTALLY ON THE WRONG SIDE. BUT THEY ARE ALSO ROBBING TOO MANY CHILDREN OF THEIR CHANCES. DEMOCRATS ARE CONTINUING TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO OF THE TEACHERS' UNION. THE RESULT IS THAT TOO MANY KIDS ARE TRAPPED IN FAILING SCHOOLS. [APPLAUSE] COMMON CORE IS A REALLY BAD IDEA. IT IS A VERSION OF CRONY CAPITALISM. TEXTBOOK COMPANIES HELPED WRITE IT. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A STANDARDIZED BUREAUCRATIC PROGRAM TO TEACH TEACHERS HOW TO TEACH AND STUDENTS HOW TO LEARN. THE REASON I SAY WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS FIGHT IS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD HAS GOD-GIVEN GIFTS. THAT EVERY CHILD WANTS TO LEARN. THAT EVERY CHILD CAN LEARN. THAT A CHILD'S OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN PREPARES THEM FOR POSSIBILITIES LATER IN LIFE. SOMETIMES I TELL PEOPLE, PROGRESSIVES ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT. BUT THEY DON'T, NOT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE POLICIES. I QUOTE THE HEAD OF THE CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION WHO TOOK TO THE MICROPHONE -- AND OF COURSE THE ISSUE OF TEACHER ACCOUNTABILITY -- SHE SAID THIS. ""WE CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERFORMANCE IN OUR CLASSROOM BECAUSE TOO MANY OF THEM ARE POOR AND COME FROM BROKEN FAMILIES."" WHAT WAS SHE SAYING? IF YOU COME FROM A BROKEN FAMILY OR ART MOORE, YOU -- OR ARE POOR, YOU CANNOT LEARN. THAT IS NOT WHAT I BELIEVE. THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU BELIEVE. AND THAT IS NOT THE UNITED STATES AMOF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND IF WE DO AWAY WITH ALL OF THESE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND PUT THE MONEY AND RESOURCES AND THE CHOICES AND THE CAP ABILITY AND THE POWER BACK WHERE IT BELONGS -- AND THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE POWER BACK WHERE IT BELONGS, WE NEED A WHOLE LOT LESS PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] YES, GO AHEAD. YOU ARE TRYING TO HAND A MIC TO THIS NICE LADY. >> YOU SPOKE ABOUT DEFENSE, HOW SPECIFICALLY WOULD YOU TO ST STRENGTHEN THE U.S. ARMED FORCES? CARLY FIORINA: FIRST, LET ME SAY THAT IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, I HAVE ADVISED TWO SECRETARIES. THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE TOOTH DECAY RATIO. TOOTHIP, THE TIP OF THE SCALE. TAIL, THE END. WE HAVE THE WORST RATIO, NOT ENOUGH AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR. NOT ENOUGH IN THE CABOOSE. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN REFORM. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? LET ME START WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL THING, LADIES AND GOVERNMENT, WE MUST HONOR, WE MUST VALUE, WE MUST CARE FOR, WE MUST LISTEN TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR MILITARY SERVICES. [APPLAUSE] THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR. THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TERRIBLE THE SITUATION IS FOR SO MANY OF OUR ARMED SERVICES WHO ARE OUT THERE. I KNOW MOMS, MAYBE SOME OF YOU DO TOO, WHO HAVE SONS AND AFGHANISTAN. THEY ARE NOT SHIPPING CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. THEIR SHIPPING BLANKETS, PILLOWS, MRES. I WAS WATCHING A YOUNG MAN GRADUATED FROM THE ACADEMY -- THE MARINES. I WATCHED HIS FAMILY. THEY HAD THAT COMBINATION OF HAPPINESS AND SADNESS, OF PRIDE AND FEAR. WE HAVE TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO SERVE FOR US. SPECIFICALLY, HOWEVER, THE ARMY BATTALIONS -- WE NEED ABOUT 36. WE NEED 440 NEW NAVAL VESSELS. THE AIR FORCE IS IN RELATIVELY GOOD SHAPE. WE NEED TO STAND WITH OUR ALLIES AND STAND WITH OUR ADVERSARIES. WE HAVE A PLAN. THERE IS A PRIORITY IN WHICH THIS HAS TO BE DONE. I HAVE SAID THAT I WOULD TALK TO NETANYAHU, THE SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN. I WILL NOT TALK TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. ALTHOUGH I HAVE MET HIM. I WILL NOT SPEAK TO HIM UNTIL WE ARE IN A POSITION OF STRENGTH. [APPLAUSE] SPECIFICALLY, ONE THE PLACES I WILL START IS REBUILDING THE FLEET UNDER HIS NOSE. REBUILDING THE DEFENSE MISSILE PROGRAM UNDER HIS NOSE IN POLAND. AND CONDUCTING REGULATORY MILITARY EXERCISES IN THE BALTIC STATES. WE MUST IMPOSE NO-FLY ZONES IN SYRIA BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA CANNOT TELL AMERICA WHEN AND WHERE TO FLY. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF ALLIES WERE ASKING US FOR HELP IN SOME OR. IT ISAND SUPPORT. I JUST GOT UP PHONE WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA. JAPAN, THE PHILIPPINES -- ALL OF ASKED FOR SPECIFIC SUPPORT. TECHNOLOGY, INTELLIGENCE SHARING, WEAPONRY IN SOME INSTANCES THE PUSHBACK BACK ON THE RISING ADVERSARY OF CH INA. WE HAVE A WHOLE SET OF ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU KNOW THAT ISIS IS EVIL. BUT WE HAD DENIED THE MOST BASIC REQUEST. WE HAVE DENIED THE KURDS, KING ABDULLAH OF JORDAN -- I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. WE HAVE DENIED INTELLIGENCE SHARING. THERE IS A WHOLE SET OF THINGS THAT WE MUST DO TO BUILD UP OUR OWN MILITARY CAPABILITY, NOT ONLY TO HONOR THOSE WHO SERVE, BUT TO HELP OUR ALLIES HELP US. AND THEY WILL HELP US. BUT THEY NEED TO SEE LEADERSHIP, SUPPORT, RESOLVE, AND STRENGTH ON THE PART OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU HANDING THE MICROPHONE TO SOMEONE? LAST QUESTION. >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CAITLIN. I AM A HOMESCHOOLED STUDENT. ONE OF MY CLASSES IS DEBATE. WE GOT AN INTERESTING QUESTION THIS WEEK, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD ANSWER IT. CARLY FIORINA: OH? CAITLIN: THE PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS -- CARLY FIORINA: IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. BY THE WAY, THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS WE MUST CONDEMN THE PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS. AND VISIT MINISTRATION HAS BEEN SILENT -- AND THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SILENT. [APPLAUSE] JOHN KERRY ANNOUNCES WITH GREAT FANFARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO ACCEPT INTO THIS COUNTRY 100,000 SYRIAN REFUGEES. THANKS A LOT, YOU WILL NOT BE AROUND TO FIGURE OUT WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. AND WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE. THIS IS A DANGEROUS THING. OUR HEARTS BREAK WHEN WE SEE THE PICTURES, WE CANNOT SIMPLY LET PEOPLE IN HERE IF WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO. BUT WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME -- [APPLAUSE] WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN UTTERLY SILENT ABOUT NOT JUST THE HEADING OF CHRISTIANS, THE MASS EXODUS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. WE CANNOT BE SILENT. AND THE SHORT ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS NO. BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WE HAVE INFLUENCE OVER SOME OF THESE NATIONS. WHEN WE SAY NOTHING, WHEN WE DO NOTHING, WE LOSE ALL OF OUR INFLUENCE. SO NOT ONLY WILL I SPEAK OUT, BUT MY ACTIONS WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH MY WORDS. AND THAT IS WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS TO SEE FROM THE U.S. ACTION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WORDS. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOU BEING HERE THIS AFTERNOON. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL FRIDAY AFTERNOON. AND YOU ARE EXERCISING CITIZENSHIP BY BEING HERE. AND I HOPE I CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON YOUR CITIZENSHIP, AS WELL AS YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR VOTES AND PRAYERS. AND I WANT TO CLOSE BY REMINDING YOU OF WHO WE ARE. BECAUSE I THINK WE REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, WE CAN DO EVERYTHING THAT MUST BE DONE TO SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS. AND TO HEAL ALL OF OUR WOUNDS. IT IS EASY TO GET DISCOURAGED AND SAY THE PROBLEMS ARE SO HUGE, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO. BUT THE TRUTH IS, YES, THE PROBLEMS ARE HUGE. BUT THE ANSWERS ARE CLEAR. I SAID THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WE WERE INTENDED TO BE A CITIZEN GOVERNMENT. THAT IS TRUE. I ALSO WANT TO REMIND YOU OF WHO WE ARE IN MORE DETAIL BY ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT TWO OF THE MOST POWERFUL SYMBOLS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. BECAUSE I THINK THEY TELL US EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WHO WE ARE. PICTURE IN YOUR MIND'S LADY LIBERTY AND LADY JUSTICE. LADY LIBERTY STANDS TALL AND STRONG, WHICH IS THE WAY AMERICA MUST ALWAYS BE. SHE IS CLEAR EYED AND RESOLUTE. SHE DOES NOT SHIELD HER EYES FROM THE REALITIES OR THE EVILS OF THE WORLD. AND YET, SHE FACES OUT INTO THE WORLD. WHICH IS THE WAY AMERICA MUST ALWAYS FACE. AND SHE HOLDS HER TORCH HIGH BECAUSE SHE KNOWS SHE IS A BEGIN OF HOPE IN A VERY TROUBLED -- A BEACON OF HOPE IN A VERY TROUBLED WORLD. LADY JUSTICE HOLDS A SWORD BY HER SIDE, A WARRIOR FOR THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES THAT HAS MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. WITH THAT SCALE, SHE IS REMINDING US THAT ALL OF US ARE EQUAL IN THE EYES OF GOD. AND SO ALL OF US MUST BE EQUAL IN THE EYES OF GOVERNMENT -- POWERFUL AND POWERLESS ALIKE. AND SHE WEARS A BLINDFOLD. AND WITH A BLINDFOLD, I THINK SHE IS REMINDING US -- HE IS SAYING TO US -- THAT IT CAN BE TRUE, IT MUST BE TRUE. THAT IN THIS NATION, THIS CENTURY IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE. IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW YOU START. IT DOES NOT MATTER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. HERE IN THIS NATION, EVERY AMERICAN LIFE MUST BE FILLED WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT COMES FROM THEIR GOD-GIVEN GIFTS. AND WE MUST BE ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [APPLAUSE] ANNOUNCER: ALL CAMPAIGN LONG, C-SPAN TAKES YOU",2015-11-07 18:05:10,2015-10-23,Beaufort,South Carolina

RUNNING AGAINST A REPUBLICAN LIKE JEB BUSH WHO BELIEVES LESS GOVERNMENT, LESS TAXES, LESS BUREAUCRACY, MORE PERSONAL FREEDOM IS RIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY. FOLKS, YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR A LOT DURING THIS PRIMARY SEASON ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT JEB BUSH. HE KNOWS THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS NOT IN GOVERNMENT. THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS IN EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO PROTECT HER STREETS EVERY DAY. THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS THE TEACHER WHO GOES TO CLASS AND SOMETIMES BUYS THEIR OWN SCHOOL SUPPLIES SO THEIR CHILDREN CAN HAVE WHAT THEY DESERVE. THAT IS THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA. WHERE IS THE UNIFORM, THE ARMED SERVICES THAT CARRY OUR FLAG OVERSEAS? AND LET ME TELL YOU. WE NEED A PRESIDENT -- WE NEED A PRESIDENT TO STAND UP FOR THE GREATNESS OF THOSE AMERICANS AND RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO REFORM THE V.A. AND PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO OUR VETERANS. WE HAVE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF IT. WE HAVE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR A THIRD TERM FOR BARACK OBAMA. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. JEB BUSH IS THE ONE PERSON IN THIS RACE THAT CAN RESTORE GREATNESS OF LEADERSHIP TO THE GOVERNMENT TO THE GREATEST NATION ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST NATION FORD TO 20 YEARS. IT HAS BEEN GREAT YESTERDAY, IT WILL BE GREAT TOMORROW. WHAT WILL MAKE A GREATER IS A GREAT PRESIDENT. WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT JEB BUSH BECAUSE WE KNOW IN 2016, JEB BUSH WILL DELIVER THAT GREATNESS. FOLKS, WHO IS READY FOR JEB BUSH? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] CONGRESSMAN JOLLY: I'M PRETTY CERTAIN ABOUT 30 MORE MINUTES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE JEB BUSH. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SPEAKER DESIGNATE RICHARD CORCORAN. >> THANK YOU. WHEN THIS RACE AND THERE WERE ALL OF THESE CANDIDATES, I SAID TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE I WILL SIT THIS ONE OUT. THEN TIME WENT BY, THE DEBATES HAPPEN, AND I REALIZED AND I'M SURE ALL OF YOU GUYS REALIZE, TOO, WE ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSS LOAD -- CROSSROADS IN OUR COUNTRY AND WHO WE CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE FREE WORLD, WE CANNOT MAKE A BAD CHOICE. SO, I SAID TO MYSELF, LOOK AT HISTORY. LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE CRITICAL TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN WE HAD TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. HOW DIFFERENT WOULD THE WORLD BE IF THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAD CHOSEN NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN OVER WINSTON CHURCHILL? WE WOULD ALL BE SPEAKING GERMAN. HOW DIFFERENT WOULD OUR LIVES BE IF THE PUNDITS SAID TO STEVE JOBS YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OF LEAVING THIS TO THIS -- YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF LEADING THIS COMPANY? AND A TALL, GANGLY GUY WHO WAS A TIMES AWKWARD HAD NOT BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT -- WE WOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH VISION. BUT YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT THEM IN HISTORY. YOU KNOW, THEY DISAPPEAR AND FOLD UP THEIR TENTS. WHAT THOSE GUYS HAD WAS A BELIEF IN THEIR VISION THAT THEY WOULD NEVER YIELD ON AND THEY HAD THE COURAGE TO FIGHT FOR BECAUSE THEY KNEW IT WAS REAL, TRUE, AND ATTAINABLE. I'M GOING TO SHARE A QUICK STORY. I HOPE YOU HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE ""CAPTAIN AMERICA."" IN THE MOVIE, THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING TO BE CAPTAIN AMERICA. THEY HAVE THE SCIENTISTS, THE PUNDITS. THEY HAVE THESE GUYS. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS OVER HERE. ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS SAID, IT'S THAT GUY OVER THERE. THE PUNDITS SAID, THAT'S CRAZY. THE SCIENTISTS SAYS, I WILL PROVE IT TO YOU. HE TOSSES A FAKE GRENADE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE TROOPS. ONE GUY LOOKS AT THE GRENADE, JUMPS ON TOP OF IT. BECAUSE HE WANTED TO SAVE THE REST OF THEM. AND THE SCIENTIST SAID, THERE IS YOUR CAPTAIN AMERICA. AND HERE IS THE REALITY. WE ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS AND WE ALL FEEL IT AND WE KNOW NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED A JOBS, A CHURCHILL, SOMEONE WITH THE REAL COURAGE AND VISION THAT INSPIRES ALL OF US. THE LEADER WHO WILL JUMP ON THAT GRENADE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WELCOME TO THE JEB BUSH I KNOW. WELCOME TO OUR CAPTAIN AMERICA. AND WELCOME TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI. MS. BOONDI: ALL RIGHT, TAMPA. I AM VERY PROUD TO INTRODUCE A MAN WHO HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR OUR STATE. AS GOVERNOR, WE KNOW JEB BUSH'S STRONG, CONSERVATIVE POLICIES EQUALS A STRONG ECONOMY. I KNOW FIRSTHAND BECAUSE I WAS A PROSECUTOR AND I SAW WHAT HE DID TO BE TOUGH ON CRIME, TO PROTECT OUR STATE, AND HE WILL DO THE SAME THING AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE KNOWS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHARACTER OF LEADERSHIP, THERE IS NO COMPROMISING. HE HAS SHOWN THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH HIS PROVEN LEADERSHIP . HE ALWAYS HAS AND JEB BUSH IS THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE TO BACK IT UP. HE HAS NOT SIMPLY CAST A VOTE, HE HAS DONE THINGS. AND HE HAS DONE THINGS FOR OUR STATE AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THEM FOR OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. AND HE IS THE HANDS-ON MAN WE NEED TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE CAN TRUST JEB BUSH, WHETHER IT IS AN INTERNATIONAL CRISIS OR IN THE EYE OF A HURRICANE. THIS MAN WILL BE HERE FOR US. HE WILL BE HERE FOR OUR COUNTRY. AND HE WILL BE HERE FOR OUR WORLD. I AM VERY PROUD TO INTRODUCE THE MAN WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA -- JEB BUSH. (music) [""TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS"" PLAYING] MR. BUSH: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. GENERAL BONDI, THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION. SPEAKER DESIGNATE CORCORAN, WHERE ARE YOU? THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE I'M CAPTAIN AMERICA -- I APPRECIATE YOU ALL COMING OUT. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE IN TAMPA WITH SO MANY FRIENDS. TODAY WE BEGAN A FOUR-DAY TRIP ACROSS FLORIDA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND NEW HAMPSHIRE TO TELL THE FLORIDA STORY. THE STORY OF A BIG, DIVERSE STATE SHAPED BY RESULTS-ORIENTED CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP, DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO, CHALLENGING THE SPECIAL INTERESTS, RESTORING OPPORTUNITY, REFUSING TO COMPROMISE IN THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM. LIFTING PEOPLE UP, NOT TEARING THEM DOWN. STANDING FOR EVERYONE. OUR STORY IS ABOUT ACTION, DOING, NOT JUST TALKING. LISTENING, LISTENING, NOT JUST LECTURING. THAT IS MY STORY AND I AM SO GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO HAVE LED THIS GREAT STATE AS YOUR GOVERNOR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT WARMS MY HEART -- [CHEERING] MR. CARSON: LAST YEAR -- MR. BUSH: LAST YEAR, LAST YEAR I IS CITED I WANT TO SHARE MY STORY WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WROTE A BOOK. I DID NOT REALLY WRITE IT, IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE. I E-MAILED IT. THEY USED TO CALL ME THE E GOVERNOR --E-GOVERNOR. FOR YEARS I GAVE OUT MY E-MAIL ADDRESS AND I GAVE IT TO ANYONE WHO WANTED TO TALK TO ME. AND E-MAIL THEY DID. PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE TOLD ME THEIR STORIES. SOMETIMES THEY ASKED QUESTIONS. SOMETIMES THEY ASKED FOR HELP. I WILL NEVER FORGET ONE LADY, IN ELDERLY WOMAN IN SOUTH FLORIDA SENT ME AN E-MAIL SAYING, GOVERNOR, I'VE GOT A RACCOON IN MY ATTIC. WHAT HE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? [LAUGHTER] MR. BUSH: SO, I CALLED UP THE FOUR CITY MANAGER FROM DEL RAY CITY, SOMEPLACE LIKE THAT AND SAID, YOU'VE GOT AN ELDERLY PERSON WHO HAS A RACCOON IN HER ATTIC. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? AND BY NOON, THAT RACCOON WITHOUT BECAUSE WE DID HAVE A -- IN TALLAHASSEE. MAN, PEOPLE DID NOT HOLD BACK. I LISTENED. I DID TRY TO E-MAIL -- ANSWER EVERY E-MAIL. IT WAS NOT SOMETHING I PREDICTED WHEN I STARTED OFFICE, BUT THIS EIGHT-YEAR ORGANIZATION WITH FLORIDA SHAPED MY GOVERNORSHIP. SO, I USED MY E-MAIL EXCHANGES TO TELL THE SORT OF STORY, TO TELL ABOUT THE WORK TO TURN ONE OF THE NATIONN'S LARGEST STATES INTO AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE WERE PEOPLE COULD LIVE, WORK, AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES AND SECURITY. IT IS A HUGE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE AND FREE FROM THE HEAVY HAND OF GOVERNMENT. HERE IS MY SHAMELESS PLUG. THE BOOK IS OUT TODAY. YOU CAN GET IT ON AMAZON.COM. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT. GOING BACK AND REREADING THESE E-MAILS REMINDED ME OF THE CHALLENGES WE TACKLED TOGETHER AND HOW MUCH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY STRONG, CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING ""JEB!""] MR. BUSH: YOU SEE, AMERICA IS IN A TIME OF TESTING AT HOME AND ABROAD. PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED. PEOPLE WONDER WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR HIM NATION. OUR ECONOMY HAS SUFFERED THE LOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. ONE IN 10 ABLE-BODIED AMERICANS CANNOT FIND FULL-TIME WORK. ONE IN SEVEN AMERICANS LIVES IN POVERTY. ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN IS ON FOOD STAMPS. BARACK OBAMA HAS GIVEN US $2 TRILLION OF NEW TAXES, BUT STILL MANAGED TO GROW THE NATIONAL DEBT BY $8 TRILLION, PLACING THE MORAL BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES AND THE NEXT GENERATION. THE WORLD IS IN TURMOIL AS AMERICA WITHDRAWS FROM ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. ISIS HAS A CALIPHATE THE SIZE OF INDIANA. IN SYRIA AND IRAQ, THEY ARE INDISCRIMINATELY KILLING MODERATE MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, WESTERN JOURNALISTS, ANYONE WHO STANDS IN THE WAY OF THEIR FANATIC IDEOLOGY. AT RED LINES GET CROSSED WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE, UNLEASHING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AS 4 BILLION SYRIAN REFUGEES FLEE THEIR NATIVE LAND. VLADIMIR PUTIN IS DECIDING -- IS SIDING WITH THE BRUTAL SYRIAN DICTATOR, SENDING WEAPONS TO IRAN, AND CONTINUING TO DEFY THE WESTERN WORLD IN UKRAINE. ALL THE WHILE OUR PRESIDENT HAS NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT THAT GIVES LEGITIMACY TO TEHRAN AND DOES NOTHING TO CURB IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL ITS GREATEST EXISTENTIAL THREAT HAS BEEN CREATED BY ITS GREATEST ALLY. THE 2016 IN ELECTION ARRIVES AT THE JUNCTURE OF OUR FAILURES ABROAD AND RESTLESSNESS AT HOME. SOON, AMERICANS WILL ONCE AGAIN ENTER A TIME FOR CHOOSING. IT TIME TO SET A NEW COURSE FOR THE COUNTRY. LAST WEEK I WAS IN COLORADO FOR THE THIRD REPUBLICAN DEBATE. IF YOU WATCH THE DEBATE, YOU PROBABLY CAME AWAY THINKING THE ELECTION IS ABOUT SOUNDBITES OR FANTASY FOOTBALL, OR WHICH CANDIDATE CAN INTERRUPT THE LOUDEST. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT A SET OF PERSONALITIES. IT IS ABOUT A SET OF PRINCIPLES. [APPLAUSE] IT IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP. IT IS ABOUT THE RIGHT VISION TO LEAD AMERICA THROUGH TURBULENT WATERS AFTER TWO TERMS OF A DIVIDER IN CHIEF WHO HAS SLICED AND DICED THE ELECTORATE BY HALF. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CHOICE TO GIVE RISE TO A NEW ERA OF POSSIBILITY OR INDULGE THIS ERA OF CYNICISM. PERHAPS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GREATEST A COMPLIMENT IS IN CREATING COMPETING PESSIMISM. MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY ARE LEFT EXPLAINING UP 2% GROWTH, MASSIVE DEBT, AND INCREASING GLOBAL ISOLATION ARE REALLY THE BEST WE CAN DO. THEY SPEAK IN DELUSIONAL TERMS ABOUT CONTAINING ISIS, ABOUT TRUSTING THE WORLD'S LARGEST STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, ABOUT HOW THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN SOLDIERS ON SYRIAN SOIL DOES NOT UNDERSCORE THE PRESIDENT'S EMPTY WORDS IN TOTAL INACTION. IT'S NOT WORKING AND ALL PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS LEFT ARE THE POLITICS OF DIVIDE AND CONQUER, SIGNING LAWLESS EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT IGNORE THE CONSTITUTION AND LAUNCHING COMPARISON ATTACKS, COMPARING HIS CRITICS TO IRANIAN HARDLINERS. WOW. AMAZING. AMERICANS HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF OUR PRESIDENT'S STRONG MAN ARGUMENTS IN A LEADING CANDIDATE WHO DOES NOT TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. [APPLAUSE] AND WHO DECLARES ROUGHLY HALF THE COUNTRY IS OUR ENEMY. IF SECRETARY CLINTON HAS HER WAY, THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WILL BE LIKE THE LAST 8 -- GRIDLOCK, GRIEVANCE, DIVISION, DEMONIZATION. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY KNOW HOW TO WIN. ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION, THEY HAVE WRITTEN A SCRIPT FOR REPUBLICANS. FRANKLY THE LAST THING THEY WANT IS A REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER WHO TAKES THEM OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE OF FOREST INDIGNATION AND PC PLATITUDES. -- FORCED INDIGNATION AND PC PLATITUDES. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. I AM NOT STEPPING INTO THE ROLE OF ANGRY AGITATOR THEY CREATED FOR US, BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT IS IN MY HEART. AND IT'S NOT TRUE TO THE CONSERVATIVE CAUSE AND IN THE END, THAT ROLE IS JUST A BIT PART IN ANOTHER STORY OF ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE LOSS AND ANOTHER LIBERAL VICTORY. THAT IS THEIR PLAN, AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO ALONG WITH IT. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: BUT I TRULY FEAR THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY SUCCEEDED IN SETTING THE TRAP FOR OUR PARTY, BRINGING IN NEW PESSIMISM ON THE RIGHT. SOME PEOPLE ON THE DEBATE STAGE TALKED OF A COUNTRY THAT WAS ONCE GREAT, BUT NOW IS IN DRAMATIC CLIMB. THEY SAY OUR BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND US. LET'S BE CLEAR. I ACKNOWLEDGED THE DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES WE FACE, BUT I REJECT THAT KIND OF THINKING. NOT BECAUSE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. BUSH: [LAUGHTER] NOT BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, BUT BECAUSE IT IS NOT TRUE. THERE IS IMPORTANT PLACE IN POLITICS FOR RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION, BUT ANGER THAT LEADS TO RESENTMENT WITHOUT RESULTS WILL TAKE US DOWN A PATH TO PERDITION. IN MY HEART, I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE NOT BEHIND US, BUT SQUARELY IN FRONT OF US, IF WE ELECT THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP AND AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT EVERY DAY WITH A REFORMER'S HEART. I WILL LEAD AND I WILL TEAR DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT KEEP AMERICANS FROM RISING UP AND REALIZING THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. I WILL DO SO, KEENLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE DEEP FRUSTRATIONS WE ALL SHARE. FRUSTRATION OVER A POROUS BORDER, WORKER WAGES REMAINING STAGNANT, FAMILIES LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THIS WILL NOT BE SOLVED WITH MORE TALK. THE ANSWER IS NOT SENDING ONE PERSON FROM ONE SIDE OF THE CAPITAL CITY TO THE OTHER. YOU CAN'T JUST TELL CONGRESS ""YOU'RE FIRED!"" AND GO TO COMMERCIAL BREAK. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A NATION ARE TWO GREAT TO ROLL THE DICE ON ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL EXPERIMENT, TO TRUST THE RHETORIC OF REFORM OVER A RECORD OF REFORM. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN FIX IT. I -- [AUDIENCE CHANTING ""JEB!""] MR. BUSH: I CAN FIX IT. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF HISTORIC CUTS TO OUR MILITARY, A FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON LEAVING FROM BEHIND, THE EMBOLDENING OF OUR ENEMIES AND ISOLATION OF OUR ALLIES, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO FIXES AMERICA'S STANDING ABROAD. I CAN FIX IT. AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF MASSIVE DEFICITS, HISTORIC DEBT, AND A PRESIDENT WHO VETOES DEFENSE SPENDING BECAUSE HE WANTS MORE RECKLESS SPENDING, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO FIXES OUR BUDGETARY MESS. I CAN FIX IT. I KNOW I CAN FIX IT BECAUSE I HAVE DONE IT. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: IN FLORIDA, WE SHOWED HOW STRONG HANDS-ON LEADERSHIP COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE. I GAVE OUT MY E-MAIL ADDRESS BECAUSE I WANTED FLORIDIANS TO KNOW THEIR GOVERNMENT CARED ABOUT THEM. OUR MEMBER E-MAILING WITH AN HONORS STUDENT NAMED KIRSTY EDWARDS WHO COULD NOT PASS THE F CAP -- FCAT BECAUSE OF HER DISABILITY. WE LISTENED. KIRSTY COULD GO ON TO COLLEGE. I REMOVE OR E-MAILING WITH SINGLE MOMS LIKE TINA CALLOWAY, WHO NEEDED HELP COLLECTING CHILD SUPPORT FROM ABSENT FATHERS. THEIR CALL FOR ASSISTANCE MOTIVATED US TO INCREASE CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTION BY 90% DURING MY TIME AS GOVERNOR. AND I REMEMBER E-MAILING TEACHERS LIKE EILEEN MILLER, WHO JOINED OUR CAUSE OF IMPROVING SCHOOLS, EVEN THOUGH THEIR UNION PRESSURED THEM TO FIGHT US EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY, AND GUESS WHAT? WE TOOK THEM ON AND WE WON. I WENT TO TALLAHASSEE AS AN AGENT OF CHANGE. I TURNED THE POLITICAL POWER AROUND. I WILL TURN WASHINGTON, D.C. UPSIDE DOWN, TOO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. BUSH: WE MAY FLORIDA THE NATIONAL LEADER IN PARENTAL CHOICE AND SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY. WE TOOK ON THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNION TO SHRINK THE SIZE OF STATE BUREAUCRACY. WE TOOK ON TRIAL LAWYERS TO REIN IN FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS, AND WE LED THE NATION IN SMALL BUSINESS CREATION. WE TOOK ON POLITICIANS FROM BOTH PARTIES, CUT TAXES EIGHT YEARS IN A ROW, TOTALING $19 BILLION, AND BY THE WAY, I VETOED LINE ITEMS IN THE BUDGET, SAVING TAXPAYERS $2 BILLION. MY GOOD FRIEND AND THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE REACTED TO ALL OF THIS BY CALLING ME VETO CORLEONE H. APPARENTLY THAT WAS NOT MEANT AS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT OF THE TIME. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. I WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. JUST BECAUSE WE ARE IN POWER DOES NOT MEAN WE GET OUR CHANCE TO BE AT THE TROUGH. A COMMITTED CONSERVATIVE LIMITS GOVERNMENTAL POWER AND SPREADS IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN WASHINGTON, D.C. [APPLAUSE] THE STORY OF MY GOVERNORSHIP WAS ONE OF USING CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES EVERY DAY CONSISTENTLY AND CONSTANTLY TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. I GOVERNED ON THE PREMISE THAT THERE ARE NO SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. IN AMERICA, EVERY CITIZEN IS AN ASSET. EVERY LIFE MATTERS. AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO RISE TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, I AM NOT YOUR GUY. BUT IF YOU WANT FUNDAMENTAL CONSERVATIVE REFORM, REFORM THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THE RECORD, NOT THE RHETORIC, THEN I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OUR TIMES ARE DIFFICULT, BUT NOT NEARLY AS DIFFICULT AS WHAT LINCOLN FACED WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE, OR WHAT FDR FACED ON DECEMBER EIGHTH, 1941. WE HAVE LONG BEEN BLESSED WITH A BENEVOLENT PRESIDENCY. LEADERS WHO TURNED OUR HIGHEST HOPES INTO DRAMATIC CHANGE THAT LEFT THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. LEADERS WHO WENT ON THEN DID MEET BEFORE GOD, ASKING HIS HELP BEFORE CARRYING OUT ORDERS THAT WOULD DETERMINE THE FATE OF MILLIONS. IT WAS LINCOLN WHO SPOKE AT THE SECOND INAUGURATION, A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE END OF THE WAR, SOOTHING WORDS OF HEALING AND HOPE, WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE, CHARITY TOWARD ALL, FIRMNESS IN THE RIGHT'S, AS GOD GIVES US THE ABILITY TO SEE THE RIGHT. LET US STRIVE ON TO THE WORK WE ARE I AND. IF LINCOLN WERE ALIVE TODAY, IMAGINE THE FOOLISHNESS HE WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER. THINK ABOUT IT. ADVISERS TELLING HIM TO SHAVE HIS BEARD. CABLE PUNDITS TELLING HIM TO LOSE THE TOP THAT. OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS CALLING HIM A FIVE-TIME LOSER BEFORE HE WAS 50. I'VE GOT A LOT OF ADVICE LATELY MYSELF. [LAUGHTER] MR. BUSH: MORE THAN ENOUGH, THANK YOU. SOME IS STYLISTIC. TAKE OFF THE SUIT COAT. DITCH THE GLASSES. GET RID OF THE PURPLE STRIPED TIE. I LIKE THE TIDE. -- I LIKE THE TIE. I LIKE THIS TIE. IT ONLY COST 20 BUCKS. OTHER ADVICE IS MORE STRATEGIC. NAIL THAT ZINGER. HIDE YOUR INNER WONK. I HAVE LEARNED IMPORTANT THINGS DURING MY TIME AS YOUR GOVERNOR PERRY 11, I CAN'T BE SOMETHING I'M NOT. -- DURING MY TIME AS YOUR GOVERNOR. . NUMBER ONE, I CAN'T BE SOMETHING I'M NOT. NUMBER TWO, THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IS LITTERED WITH CANDIDATES DISGUISED AS TELEVISION CRITICS, BUT LEADERSHIP IS SOMETHING FAR DIFFERENT. IT IS ABOUT TELLING SOMEONE NOT WHAT THEY WANT TO BE HER, BUT WHAT THEY MUST HEAR. IT'S NOT ABOUT SAYING THE RIGHT THING, BUT DOING THE RIGHT THING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. BUSH: IT'S NOT ABOUT TEARING PEOPLE DOWN, BUT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO WIN THIS RACE, BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS SOME NOT WILLING TO DO. I WILL NOT COMPROMISE ON MY PRINCIPLES. I WILL NOT TRADE IN AN OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK, PUT ON THE CLOAK OF AN ANGRY AGITATOR, AND I WILL NOT MAKE ANYONE FEEL SMALL SO I CAN FEEL BIG. AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR A PRESIDENT, NOT A PUNDIT. A LEADER, NOT A PROTESTER. FOR SEVEN HALF YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN LED BY A CYNIC IN CHIEF. IT IS TIME WE ELECTED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS LEADERSHIP INVOLVES SOLVING TOMORROW'S CHALLENGES. I AM RUNNING THIS CAMPAIGN ON MY OWN TERMS. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHEN THE DUST CLEARS AND THE DELHI'S ACCOUNTING, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS CAMPAIGN. -- AND WE DELEGATES ARE COUNTED, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS CAMPAIGN. [AUDIENCE CHANTING ""JEB!""] MR. BUSH: I WILL BE TRUE TO MYSELF, OPTIMISTIC AND INCLUSIVE. I WILL APPEAL TO OUR BETTER ANGELS, NOT OUR GREATEST FEARS. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO FIGHTS FOR ALL. JOIN ME IN THIS TOURNEY. FIGHT WITH ME AS WE WORK TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CULTURE OF WASHINGTON. LET US SEEK THE PROMISE OF A FLEDGLING REPUBLIC FORM 200 YEARS AGO. IT LAND OF LIMITLESS PROMISE AND POSSIBILITY FOR ALL WHO ARE BLESSED TO BECOME AMERICANS. LET US SEE THIS TOGETHER WITH FAITH, HOPE,, AND TRUST, IN OURSELVES, IN ONE ANOTHER, IN THE GOD WHO MADE US ALL AND GUIDES US. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

LIFTING PEOPLE UP, NOT TEARING THEM DOWN. STANDING FOR EVERYONE. OUR STORY IS ABOUT ACTION, DOING, NOT JUST TALKING. LISTENING, LISTENING, NOT JUST LECTURING. THAT IS MY STORY AND I AM SO GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO HAVE LED THIS GREAT STATE AS YOUR GOVERNOR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT WARMS MY HEART -- [CHEERING] MR. CARSON: LAST YEAR -- MR. BUSH: LAST YEAR, LAST YEAR I IS CITED I WANT TO SHARE MY STORY WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WROTE A BOOK. I DID NOT REALLY WRITE IT, IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE. I E-MAILED IT. THEY USED TO CALL ME THE E GOVERNOR --E-GOVERNOR. FOR YEARS I GAVE OUT MY E-MAIL ADDRESS AND I GAVE IT TO ANYONE WHO WANTED TO TALK TO ME. AND E-MAIL THEY DID. PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE TOLD ME THEIR STORIES. SOMETIMES THEY ASKED QUESTIONS. SOMETIMES THEY ASKED FOR HELP. I WILL NEVER FORGET ONE LADY, IN ELDERLY WOMAN IN SOUTH FLORIDA SENT ME AN E-MAIL SAYING, GOVERNOR, I'VE GOT A RACCOON IN MY ATTIC. WHAT HE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? [LAUGHTER] MR. BUSH: SO, I CALLED UP THE FOUR CITY MANAGER FROM DEL RAY CITY, SOMEPLACE LIKE THAT AND SAID, YOU'VE GOT AN ELDERLY PERSON WHO HAS A RACCOON IN HER ATTIC. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? AND BY NOON, THAT RACCOON WITHOUT BECAUSE WE DID HAVE A -- IN TALLAHASSEE. MAN, PEOPLE DID NOT HOLD BACK. I LISTENED. I DID TRY TO E-MAIL -- ANSWER EVERY E-MAIL. IT WAS NOT SOMETHING I PREDICTED WHEN I STARTED OFFICE, BUT THIS EIGHT-YEAR ORGANIZATION WITH FLORIDA SHAPED MY GOVERNORSHIP. SO, I USED MY E-MAIL EXCHANGES TO TELL THE SORT OF STORY, TO TELL ABOUT THE WORK TO TURN ONE OF THE NATIONN'S LARGEST STATES INTO AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE WERE PEOPLE COULD LIVE, WORK, AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES AND SECURITY. IT IS A HUGE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE AND FREE FROM THE HEAVY HAND OF GOVERNMENT. HERE IS MY SHAMELESS PLUG. THE BOOK IS OUT TODAY. YOU CAN GET IT ON AMAZON.COM. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT. GOING BACK AND REREADING THESE E-MAILS REMINDED ME OF THE CHALLENGES WE TACKLED TOGETHER AND HOW MUCH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY STRONG, CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING ""JEB!""] MR. BUSH: YOU SEE, AMERICA IS IN A TIME OF TESTING AT HOME AND ABROAD. PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED. PEOPLE WONDER WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR HIM NATION. OUR ECONOMY HAS SUFFERED THE LOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. ONE IN 10 ABLE-BODIED AMERICANS CANNOT FIND FULL-TIME WORK. ONE IN SEVEN AMERICANS LIVES IN POVERTY. ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN IS ON FOOD STAMPS. BARACK OBAMA HAS GIVEN US $2 TRILLION OF NEW TAXES, BUT STILL MANAGED TO GROW THE NATIONAL DEBT BY $8 TRILLION, PLACING THE MORAL BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES AND THE NEXT GENERATION. THE WORLD IS IN TURMOIL AS AMERICA WITHDRAWS FROM ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. ISIS HAS A CALIPHATE THE SIZE OF INDIANA. IN SYRIA AND IRAQ, THEY ARE INDISCRIMINATELY KILLING MODERATE MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, WESTERN JOURNALISTS, ANYONE WHO STANDS IN THE WAY OF THEIR FANATIC IDEOLOGY. AT RED LINES GET CROSSED WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE, UNLEASHING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AS 4 BILLION SYRIAN REFUGEES FLEE THEIR NATIVE LAND. VLADIMIR PUTIN IS DECIDING -- IS SIDING WITH THE BRUTAL SYRIAN DICTATOR, SENDING WEAPONS TO IRAN, AND CONTINUING TO DEFY THE WESTERN WORLD IN UKRAINE. ALL THE WHILE OUR PRESIDENT HAS NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT THAT GIVES LEGITIMACY TO TEHRAN AND DOES NOTHING TO CURB IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL ITS GREATEST EXISTENTIAL THREAT HAS BEEN CREATED BY ITS GREATEST ALLY. THE 2016 IN ELECTION ARRIVES AT THE JUNCTURE OF OUR FAILURES ABROAD AND RESTLESSNESS AT HOME. SOON, AMERICANS WILL ONCE AGAIN ENTER A TIME FOR CHOOSING. IT TIME TO SET A NEW COURSE FOR THE COUNTRY. LAST WEEK I WAS IN COLORADO FOR THE THIRD REPUBLICAN DEBATE. IF YOU WATCH THE DEBATE, YOU PROBABLY CAME AWAY THINKING THE ELECTION IS ABOUT SOUNDBITES OR FANTASY FOOTBALL, OR WHICH CANDIDATE CAN INTERRUPT THE LOUDEST. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT A SET OF PERSONALITIES. IT IS ABOUT A SET OF PRINCIPLES. [APPLAUSE] IT IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP. IT IS ABOUT THE RIGHT VISION TO LEAD AMERICA THROUGH TURBULENT WATERS AFTER TWO TERMS OF A DIVIDER IN CHIEF WHO HAS SLICED AND DICED THE ELECTORATE BY HALF. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CHOICE TO GIVE RISE TO A NEW ERA OF POSSIBILITY OR INDULGE THIS ERA OF CYNICISM. PERHAPS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GREATEST A COMPLIMENT IS IN CREATING COMPETING PESSIMISM. MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY ARE LEFT EXPLAINING UP 2% GROWTH, MASSIVE DEBT, AND INCREASING GLOBAL ISOLATION ARE REALLY THE BEST WE CAN DO. THEY SPEAK IN DELUSIONAL TERMS ABOUT CONTAINING ISIS, ABOUT TRUSTING THE WORLD'S LARGEST STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, ABOUT HOW THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN SOLDIERS ON SYRIAN SOIL DOES NOT UNDERSCORE THE PRESIDENT'S EMPTY WORDS IN TOTAL INACTION. IT'S NOT WORKING AND ALL PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS LEFT ARE THE POLITICS OF DIVIDE AND CONQUER, SIGNING LAWLESS EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT IGNORE THE CONSTITUTION AND LAUNCHING COMPARISON ATTACKS, COMPARING HIS CRITICS TO IRANIAN HARDLINERS. WOW. AMAZING. AMERICANS HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF OUR PRESIDENT'S STRONG MAN ARGUMENTS IN A LEADING CANDIDATE WHO DOES NOT TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. [APPLAUSE] AND WHO DECLARES ROUGHLY HALF THE COUNTRY IS OUR ENEMY. IF SECRETARY CLINTON HAS HER WAY, THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WILL BE LIKE THE LAST 8 -- GRIDLOCK, GRIEVANCE, DIVISION, DEMONIZATION. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY KNOW HOW TO WIN. ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION, THEY HAVE WRITTEN A SCRIPT FOR REPUBLICANS. FRANKLY THE LAST THING THEY WANT IS A REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER WHO TAKES THEM OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE OF FOREST INDIGNATION AND PC PLATITUDES. -- FORCED INDIGNATION AND PC PLATITUDES. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. I AM NOT STEPPING INTO THE ROLE OF ANGRY AGITATOR THEY CREATED FOR US, BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT IS IN MY HEART. AND IT'S NOT TRUE TO THE CONSERVATIVE CAUSE AND IN THE END, THAT ROLE IS JUST A BIT PART IN ANOTHER STORY OF ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE LOSS AND ANOTHER LIBERAL VICTORY. THAT IS THEIR PLAN, AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO ALONG WITH IT. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: BUT I TRULY FEAR THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY SUCCEEDED IN SETTING THE TRAP FOR OUR PARTY, BRINGING IN NEW PESSIMISM ON THE RIGHT. SOME PEOPLE ON THE DEBATE STAGE TALKED OF A COUNTRY THAT WAS ONCE GREAT, BUT NOW IS IN DRAMATIC CLIMB. THEY SAY OUR BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND US. LET'S BE CLEAR. I ACKNOWLEDGED THE DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES WE FACE, BUT I REJECT THAT KIND OF THINKING. NOT BECAUSE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. BUSH: [LAUGHTER] NOT BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, BUT BECAUSE IT IS NOT TRUE. THERE IS IMPORTANT PLACE IN POLITICS FOR RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION, BUT ANGER THAT LEADS TO RESENTMENT WITHOUT RESULTS WILL TAKE US DOWN A PATH TO PERDITION. IN MY HEART, I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE NOT BEHIND US, BUT SQUARELY IN FRONT OF US, IF WE ELECT THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP AND AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT EVERY DAY WITH A REFORMER'S HEART. I WILL LEAD AND I WILL TEAR DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT KEEP AMERICANS FROM RISING UP AND REALIZING THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. I WILL DO SO, KEENLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE DEEP FRUSTRATIONS WE ALL SHARE. FRUSTRATION OVER A POROUS BORDER, WORKER WAGES REMAINING STAGNANT, FAMILIES LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THIS WILL NOT BE SOLVED WITH MORE TALK. THE ANSWER IS NOT SENDING ONE PERSON FROM ONE SIDE OF THE CAPITAL CITY TO THE OTHER. YOU CAN'T JUST TELL CONGRESS ""YOU'RE FIRED!"" AND GO TO COMMERCIAL BREAK. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A NATION ARE TWO GREAT TO ROLL THE DICE ON ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL EXPERIMENT, TO TRUST THE RHETORIC OF REFORM OVER A RECORD OF REFORM. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN FIX IT. I -- [AUDIENCE CHANTING ""JEB!""] MR. BUSH: I CAN FIX IT. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF HISTORIC CUTS TO OUR MILITARY, A FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON LEAVING FROM BEHIND, THE EMBOLDENING OF OUR ENEMIES AND ISOLATION OF OUR ALLIES, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO FIXES AMERICA'S STANDING ABROAD. I CAN FIX IT. AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF MASSIVE DEFICITS, HISTORIC DEBT, AND A PRESIDENT WHO VETOES DEFENSE SPENDING BECAUSE HE WANTS MORE RECKLESS SPENDING, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO FIXES OUR BUDGETARY MESS. I CAN FIX IT. I KNOW I CAN FIX IT BECAUSE I HAVE DONE IT. [CHEERING] MR. BUSH: IN FLORIDA, WE SHOWED HOW STRONG HANDS-ON LEADERSHIP COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE. I GAVE OUT MY E-MAIL ADDRESS BECAUSE I WANTED FLORIDIANS TO KNOW THEIR GOVERNMENT CARED ABOUT THEM. OUR MEMBER E-MAILING WITH AN HONORS STUDENT NAMED KIRSTY EDWARDS WHO COULD NOT PASS THE F CAP -- FCAT BECAUSE OF HER DISABILITY. WE LISTENED. KIRSTY COULD GO ON TO COLLEGE. I REMOVE OR E-MAILING WITH SINGLE MOMS LIKE TINA CALLOWAY, WHO NEEDED HELP COLLECTING CHILD SUPPORT FROM ABSENT FATHERS. THEIR CALL FOR ASSISTANCE MOTIVATED US TO INCREASE CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTION BY 90% DURING MY TIME AS GOVERNOR. AND I REMEMBER E-MAILING TEACHERS LIKE EILEEN MILLER, WHO JOINED OUR CAUSE OF IMPROVING SCHOOLS, EVEN THOUGH THEIR UNION PRESSURED THEM TO FIGHT US EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY, AND GUESS WHAT? WE TOOK THEM ON AND WE WON. I WENT TO TALLAHASSEE AS AN AGENT OF CHANGE. I TURNED THE POLITICAL POWER AROUND. I WILL TURN WASHINGTON, D.C. UPSIDE DOWN, TOO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. BUSH: WE MAY FLORIDA THE NATIONAL LEADER IN PARENTAL CHOICE AND SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY. WE TOOK ON THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNION TO SHRINK THE SIZE OF STATE BUREAUCRACY. WE TOOK ON TRIAL LAWYERS TO REIN IN FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS, AND WE LED THE NATION IN SMALL BUSINESS CREATION. WE TOOK ON POLITICIANS FROM BOTH PARTIES, CUT TAXES EIGHT YEARS IN A ROW, TOTALING $19 BILLION, AND BY THE WAY, I VETOED LINE ITEMS IN THE BUDGET, SAVING TAXPAYERS $2 BILLION. MY GOOD FRIEND AND THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE REACTED TO ALL OF THIS BY CALLING ME VETO CORLEONE H. APPARENTLY THAT WAS NOT MEANT AS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT OF THE TIME. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. I WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. JUST BECAUSE WE ARE IN POWER DOES NOT MEAN WE GET OUR CHANCE TO BE AT THE TROUGH. A COMMITTED CONSERVATIVE LIMITS GOVERNMENTAL POWER AND SPREADS IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN WASHINGTON, D.C. [APPLAUSE] THE STORY OF MY GOVERNORSHIP WAS ONE OF USING CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES EVERY DAY CONSISTENTLY AND CONSTANTLY TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. I GOVERNED ON THE PREMISE THAT THERE ARE NO SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. IN AMERICA, EVERY CITIZEN IS AN ASSET. EVERY LIFE MATTERS. AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO RISE TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, I AM NOT YOUR GUY. BUT IF YOU WANT FUNDAMENTAL CONSERVATIVE REFORM, REFORM THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THE RECORD, NOT THE RHETORIC, THEN I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OUR TIMES ARE DIFFICULT, BUT NOT NEARLY AS DIFFICULT AS WHAT LINCOLN FACED WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE, OR WHAT FDR FACED ON DECEMBER EIGHTH, 1941. WE HAVE LONG BEEN BLESSED WITH A BENEVOLENT PRESIDENCY. LEADERS WHO TURNED OUR HIGHEST HOPES INTO DRAMATIC CHANGE THAT LEFT THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. LEADERS WHO WENT ON THEN DID MEET BEFORE GOD, ASKING HIS HELP BEFORE CARRYING OUT ORDERS THAT WOULD DETERMINE THE FATE OF MILLIONS. IT WAS LINCOLN WHO SPOKE AT THE SECOND INAUGURATION, A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE END OF THE WAR, SOOTHING WORDS OF HEALING AND HOPE, WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE, CHARITY TOWARD ALL, FIRMNESS IN THE RIGHT'S, AS GOD GIVES US THE ABILITY TO SEE THE RIGHT. LET US STRIVE ON TO THE WORK WE ARE I AND. IF LINCOLN WERE ALIVE TODAY, IMAGINE THE FOOLISHNESS HE WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER. THINK ABOUT IT. ADVISERS TELLING HIM TO SHAVE HIS BEARD. CABLE PUNDITS TELLING HIM TO LOSE THE TOP THAT. OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS CALLING HIM A FIVE-TIME LOSER BEFORE HE WAS 50. I'VE GOT A LOT OF ADVICE LATELY MYSELF. [LAUGHTER] MR. BUSH: MORE THAN ENOUGH, THANK YOU. SOME IS STYLISTIC. TAKE OFF THE SUIT COAT. DITCH THE GLASSES. GET RID OF THE PURPLE STRIPED TIE. I LIKE THE TIDE. -- I LIKE THE TIE. I LIKE THIS TIE. IT ONLY COST 20 BUCKS. OTHER ADVICE IS MORE STRATEGIC. NAIL THAT ZINGER. HIDE YOUR INNER WONK. I HAVE LEARNED IMPORTANT THINGS DURING MY TIME AS YOUR GOVERNOR PERRY 11, I CAN'T BE SOMETHING I'M NOT. -- DURING MY TIME AS YOUR GOVERNOR. . NUMBER ONE, I CAN'T BE SOMETHING I'M NOT. NUMBER TWO, THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IS LITTERED WITH CANDIDATES DISGUISED AS TELEVISION CRITICS, BUT LEADERSHIP IS SOMETHING FAR DIFFERENT. IT IS ABOUT TELLING SOMEONE NOT WHAT THEY WANT TO BE HER, BUT WHAT THEY MUST HEAR. IT'S NOT ABOUT SAYING THE RIGHT THING, BUT DOING THE RIGHT THING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. BUSH: IT'S NOT ABOUT TEARING PEOPLE DOWN, BUT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO WIN THIS RACE, BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS SOME NOT WILLING TO DO. I WILL NOT COMPROMISE ON MY PRINCIPLES. I WILL NOT TRADE IN AN OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK, PUT ON THE CLOAK OF AN ANGRY AGITATOR, AND I WILL NOT MAKE ANYONE FEEL SMALL SO I CAN FEEL BIG. AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR A PRESIDENT, NOT A PUNDIT. A LEADER, NOT A PROTESTER. FOR SEVEN HALF YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN LED BY A CYNIC IN CHIEF. IT IS TIME WE ELECTED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS LEADERSHIP INVOLVES SOLVING TOMORROW'S CHALLENGES. I AM RUNNING THIS CAMPAIGN ON MY OWN TERMS. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHEN THE DUST CLEARS AND THE DELHI'S ACCOUNTING, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS CAMPAIGN. -- AND WE DELEGATES ARE COUNTED, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS CAMPAIGN. [AUDIENCE CHANTING ""JEB!""] MR. BUSH: I WILL BE TRUE TO MYSELF, OPTIMISTIC AND INCLUSIVE. I WILL APPEAL TO OUR BETTER ANGELS, NOT OUR GREATEST FEARS. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO FIGHTS FOR ALL. JOIN ME IN THIS TOURNEY. FIGHT WITH ME AS WE WORK TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CULTURE OF WASHINGTON. LET US SEEK THE PROMISE OF A FLEDGLING REPUBLIC FORM 200 YEARS AGO. IT LAND OF LIMITLESS PROMISE AND POSSIBILITY FOR ALL WHO ARE BLESSED TO BECOME AMERICANS. LET US SEE THIS TOGETHER WITH FAITH, HOPE,, AND TRUST, IN OURSELVES, IN ONE ANOTHER, IN THE GOD WHO MADE US ALL AND GUIDES US. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327740-1/senator-ted-cruz-rtx-religious-rally-des-moines-iowa,"Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) Religious Rally in Des Moines, Iowa",Ted Cruz,"C-SPAN. >> IN HIS QUEST FOR THE 2016 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, IT CALLED A RALLY FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FEATURED SPEAKERS FROM LOSING A JOB TO VANDALISM TO LOSING A BUSINESS. FRZ >> WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE RALLY FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES. WELCOME TO IOWA. SOME OF YOU THAT AREN'T FROM IOWA. THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOU ARE FROM IOWA AND WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT, JOINING WITH US TO RALLY FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES. THIS IS A SERIOUS TOPIC THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TONIGHT. MOST OF US, MANY OF US ARE, DESCENDANTS OF PEOPLE WHO LEFT OTHER COUNTRIES, GENERATIONS AGO, TO ESCAPE RELIGIOUS PERCUSHION. TO COME TO A COUNTRY TO CELEBRATE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND OUR FAMILIES COULD WORSHIP GOD IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT MANDATED BY THE GOVERNMENT, THAT WAS NOT CONTROLLED BY SOMEBODY ELSE OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIOUS AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT GOD CALLED THEM TO DO AND TO LIVE THE SORT OF LIVE THAT GOD CALLED THEM TO LIVE. WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS HANDED TO US BY THOSE PATRIOTS WHO TOOK GREAT RISKS TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND TO COME TO AMERICA. THEY GAVE US A PLACE WHERE WE COULD RAISE FAMILIES, LIKE THE ONES YOU JUST SAW. WEREN'T THEY GREAT? [APPLAUSE] IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, WHEN YOU WATCH THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE, SING AND PLAY AND USE THEIR GIFTS TO GLORIFY GOD, IT GIVES YOU HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. AND, TONIGHT, AS WE COME TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME SERIOUS SUBJECTS. YOU'RE GOING TO MEET SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THINGS THAT OUR FOREFATHERS WOULD HAVE NEVER BELIEVED COULD HAVE HAPPENED. YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR STORIES THAT I THINK WILL CAUSE YOUR HEART TO PERHAPS SKIP A BEAT WHEN YOU REALIZE THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND YET, WE STILL HAVE THE FREEDOM TO COME TOGETHER AND IN JESUS NAME, GATHER LIKE THEY JUST DID, SING PATRIOTIC SONGS AND TO ALSO ELEVATE THE NAME OF THEIR LORD AND SAVIOR. ULTIMATELY, THAT IS WHY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING. NOT JUST TONIGHT. BUT WHY WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES FOR A LONG, LONG TIME AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO HAD A POINT IN TIME WHERE THERE CONVICTION CAME IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A ONGOING, LONGSTANDING COMPONENTS OF WHO THEY ARE. IT'S NOT THE POINT IN HISTORY OR POINT IN TIME WHEN YOU'RE CONFRONTED TO MAKE A DECISION, WILL I STAND ON MY PRINCIPLES OR FOLLOW THEM. IT'S NOT THAT POINT IN TIME WHERE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION. IT'S EVERY DAY THAT LEADS UP TO THAT EXPERIENCE AND IT'S YOUR CONSISTENT WALK AND YOUR CONSISTENT PRACTICE AND THE EDUCATION THAT YOU'VE LIKELY HAD FROM YOUR PARENTS, YOUR GRANDPARENTS AND THAT SORT OF THING THAT CREATES THE CHARACTER THAT CAUSES YOU, WHEN YOU BECOME CONFRONTED WITH THAT SITUATION TO SAY, I CANNOT. I CANNOT VIOLATE WHAT GOD'S CALLED ME TO DO. AND SO TONIGHT, AS WE -- AS WE HEAR THESE PEOPLE'S STORIES, AS WE SHARE IN THEIR EXPERIENCE, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T MISS THE POINT. AND THE POINT OF A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TONIGHT IS THAT THEIR STORY IS YOUR STORY. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS, PERHAPS IT HASN'T HAPPENED TO YOU YET. BUT WHEN YOU HEAR THESE STORIES AND AS YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD I DO IN THAT SITUATION, INTERNALIZE THAT VERY QUESTION BECAUSE YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE FACED WITH THAT SITUATION. IN FACT, I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, MAYBE IT'S THE SENSITIVITY TRAINING YOUR WORK REQUIRES YOU TO GO THROUGH, YOU THINK IF I'M QUIET ENOUGH AND GET THROUGH THIS, I CAN GET BACK TO WORK AND DO WHAT I NEED TO DO. MAYBE IT'S SOMEBODY WHO COMES AND GOES FROM A CIVIC CLUB OR A SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE VOCAL ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE, WILL I TELL THE TRUTH OR BE QUIET OR STEP BACK AND LET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO? I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR STORY IS YOUR STORY. THIS IS NOT A TIME TO GATHER THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TOGETHER TO COME IN AND JUST OBSERVE TO BE ENTERTAINED OR TO BE HERE TO JUST LIFT THEM UP AND WE WANT TO LIFT YOU UP TONIGHT. WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SACRIFICES YOU HAVE MADE, AS YOU TELL YOUR STORIES, ARE VERY REAL AND INSPIRING TO US. WHEN WE LEAVE TONIGHT, WE HEARD STORIES FROM PEOPLE WE ADMIRE, WE MISSED WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE. THEIR STORY IS YOUR STORY. THEIR STORY AND YOUR STORY IS IMPORTANT. IN PART, BECAUSE IN AMERICA, WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO OWN AND CONDUCT BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR FAITH. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD A PUBLIC JOB AND CONDUCT OURSELVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR FAITH. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A SERVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR FAITH AND THE REASON THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU AND I STAND TOGETHER WITH THESE FOLKS AND FOLKS LIKE THEM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IS NOT JUST BECAUSE THEIR LIVELIHOOD IS BEING THREATENED, BUT AT THE BASE OF THAT IS THAT EACH ONE OF US IS CALLED TO SHARE OUR FAITH WITH OTHERS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THOSE SITUATIONS, WHETHER IT'S SOMEBODY THAT WALKS INTO YOUR SHOP OR THE ENCOUNTER YOU HAVE AT YOUR PLACE OF BUSINESS OR THE COMPANY YOU WORK WITH, EACH OF THOSE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO NOT JUST SAY, THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE, BASED ON GOD'S WORD, BUT THE -- THAT CONVERSATION THEN OPENS THE DOOR FOR YOU TO LOOK THAT PERSON IN THE EYE AND SAY YOU AND I HAVE A SHARE D SITUATION. WE ARE BOTH SIMPLE HUMANS AND BOTH WITH NATURE AND IN NEED OF A SAVIOR. IN THIS COUNTRY, WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHARE OUR FAITH FREELY BUT IT'S BEING THREATENED. IF IT BECOMES CRIMINAL, WHICH IT HAS, IN THESE FOLKS CASE, IF IT BECOMES CRIMINAL TO SAY, I CARE ENOUGH ABOUT YOU THAT I WANT TO LIVE OUT MY FAITH IN A WAY THAT WOULD HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SIN IN YOUR LIFE, I MEAN, I PRESUME THERE ARE MANY BELIEVERS IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT. [APPLAUSE] YOU WOULD NOT BE THERE, IN THAT PLACE. YOU WOULD NOT BE IN THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR GOD IF YOU HADN'T COME TO A POSITION WHERE YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WERE LOST. THAT YOU WERE LOST IN YOUR SIN. ETERNITY IS A LONG TIME AND HELL IS A HOT PLACE AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE AND SOMEONE CARED ABOUT YOU ENOUGH TO SHARE THE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST AND SAID THERE IS A SAVIOR THAT CARED ENOUGH ABOUT YOU THAT GOD SENT HIS SON TO TAKE YOUR SIN ON HIMSELF, TO DIE IN YOUR PLACE AND TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWER OR SIN AND DEATH BY RISING AGAIN. IF IT HAD BEEN ILLEGAL FOR SOMEBODY TO SAY THAT, HOW MUCH SMALLER MIGHT OUR NUMBERS BE? THE REASON THAT WE STILL LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT IS BLESSED IN THE WAYS -- IN THE MANY WAYS THAT WE ARE, I BELIEVE, IS BECAUSE OUR FOUNDERS, IN AND AMONGST ALL THE RIGHTS THAT THEY ITEMIZED IN OUR CONSTITUTION, IN THE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN ALL OF OUR EARLIER FINDINGS AND DOCUMENTS AND WRITINGS, THEY CAME FROM WHAT THOSE FOUNDING FATHERS LEARNED FROM THEIR PREACHERS. IN FACT, MANY OF THEM WERE PREACHERS SO IF WE LOOK AT THE FAMILY OR THE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE THINK WE WANT FOR THEM A BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN WHAT WE HAD, JUST LIKE OUR PARENTS WANTED A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR US THAN THEY HAD, THE KEY, THE PIN, THE FOCAL POINT FOR BEING ABLE TO DO THAT, THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY AS A COUNTRY, HAS BEEN PRESERVING OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. KEEP IN MIND, IF FOR SOME REASON, A GOVERNMENT OR A COURT CAN TAKE AWAY OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES AND OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM TAKING THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR ANY OTHER RIGHT? OUR RIGHTS COME FROM GOD, NOT FROM THE GOVERNMENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TONIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO MEET SOME GREAT PATRIOTS. YOU'RE GOING TO MEET SOME FOLKS WHO ARE EXAMPLES OF AVERAGE, EVERY DAY ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO CERTAINLY WOULDN'T IMAGINE THEY WOULD BE SITTING HERE, TELLING YOU THEIR STORY AND YET WHEN THE TIME FOR CHOOSING CAME, THEY CHOSE THEIR LORD AND SAVIOR OVER COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT OR GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] MY HOPE IS, THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS EVENING AND WHEN WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION OF THIS EVENING, THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED ENOUGH WITH THEIR STORIES THAT IN YOUR HEART AND IN YOUR MIND, YOU'RE PREPARED TO SAY, WHEN IT COMES MY TURN, I'M GOING TO STAND WITH THEM AND I'M GOING TO STAND WITH MY GOD, NO MATTER WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS. [APPLAUSE] AS WE GET STARTED TONIGHT, WE WANT TO INVITE A LOCAL PASTOR TO COME AND LEAD US IN PRAYER. MIKE IS A PASTOR WHO'S BECOME A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE OVER THE YEARS. HE PASTORS A SMALLER CHURCH, THEY HAVE AN INFLUENCE THAT IS FAR LARGER IN THIS COMMUNITY THAN THEIR NUMBERS WOULD IMPLY. PASTOR MIKE IS UNAFRAID AND IS BOLD AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S CALLED TO DO AND HE GOES AND DOES IT. AND LET'S THE WORLD SEE HIM LIVE OUT HIS FAITH. I'M GOING TO INVITE HIM TO COME AND TELL A LITTLE BIT OF HIS STORY AND SHARE AN EXPERIENCE HE HAD, AS HE PREACHED ON THE SUBJECT THAT IS KIND OF AT THE CENTER OF THIS EVENING AND TO LEAD US IN PRAYER. PASTOR MIKE, IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] >> IT WARMS MY HEART TO SEE ALL OF YOU HEAR TONIGHT. I AM REALLY HONORED TO BE APART OF THIS EXPERIENCE AND TO SAY THAT I, EARLY ON, WAS BE ABLE TO SAY, MR. CRUZ, I'M WITH YOU ALL THE WAY. IN HIS ABILITY TO ARTICULATE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES AND HE'LL FIGHT FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. I'M HONORED TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE WITH YOU. BUT WHAT I KNOW IS, THERE'S COMING A DAY WHEN A PASTOR, STANDING BEHIND HERE, PREACHING THE WHOLE COUNCIL OF THE WORD OF GOD IS GOING TO BE SEEN AND DEEMED AS A THREAT AND I PRAY THAT EVERY PASTOR CONTINUES TO PREACH GOD'S WORD, UNFILTERED, AS COURAGEOUSLY AS THEY CAN BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WILL TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO ASK YOU, IF YOU'RE PHYSICALLY ABLE, AS WE ADDRESS A RIGHTEOUS AND HOLY GOD. WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WHO YOU ARE. THE BLESSINGS THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO THIS GREAT NATION WE ARE APART OF. YOU HAVE SAID THAT BLESSED IS THE NATION WHOSE GOD IS THE LORD AND WE HAVE TURNED OUR BACK ON YOU. FORGIVE US, GOD. REPENT. THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE, THOUSANDS ACROSS OUR LAND THAT SAY, WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK. AND SO, GOD, WE JUST CRY OUT TO YOU AND SAY, LORD, HELP US STAND FIRM IN THE TORRENT THAT IS BEFORE US. AND I THANK YOU, GOD, FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WILL BE HERE, THE EXAMPLES THAT WE SEE OF COURAGE AND CONVICTION IN A CULTURE THAT IS SO COMP RUMIZEED. HELP US, GOD, TO NEVER TURN OUR BACKS ON JESUS. HELP US TO ALWAYS STAND FOR TRUTH. WE PRAY THIS PRAYER IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD, AMEN. [APPLAUSE] I WAS THINKING, AS WE WERE GETTING READY FOR THIS EVENT, MY KIDS, AND THE SORT OF WORLD WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE TO THEM. THE SORTS OF DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD AROUND THE DINNER TABLE, A GENERATION AGO, YOU WOULD NEVER IMAGINE. NOT JUST EXPLAINING THE BIBLICAL TRUTH I WANT MY SON'S TO GO BY, BUT THE SOCIETY WE ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN AND EXPLAINING TO THEM, THIS IS GOD'S TRUTH AND WHEN YOU SAY THIS PUBLICLY, YOU ARE LIKELY TO COME UNDER PERSECUTION OR PRESSURE. WHAT PASTOR MIKE DIDN'T SAY AND I'LL TELL YOU FOR HIM, HE PUT UP A TITLE OF A MESSAGE OF HIS MARKEE THAT DEALT WITH SIN AND THE FOLKS THAT WERE CONVICTED BY THAT SIGN VANDALIZED THE SIGN, THREATENED HIM AND HIS FAMILY. CALLED THE NEWS. AMAZING, A PASTOR'S PREACHING ON SIN. THE NEWS PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS NEWSWORTHY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING, TOO. MIKE SAW JUST A LITTLE GLIM S OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH. HOW AMAZING THAT WE COME TO A POINT WHERE I HAVE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH MY KIDS. THEN IT CAUSED ME TO THINK ABOUT MY PARENTS, MY GRANDPARENTS, MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN HERE UHWHO'S A GRANDDAUGHTER OR GRANDSON FOR THE REVOLUTION? YOUR FAMILY WAS A PART OF THE REVOLUTION? I'M SEEING HANDS. HOW ABOUT FOLKS WHO EITHER FOUGHT IN OR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II OR WORLD WAR II. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED OR WHO ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED. DON'T SQUANDER THE SACRIFICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY OUR FOREFATHERS. [APPLAUSE] TONIGHT, I HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF INTRODUCEING A FRIEND OF MINE. I'VE SPENT MANY, MANY MILES SITTING NEXT TO HIM IN A CAR, LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND DISCUSSING ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. ALL SORTS OF TOPICS, BOTH PHILOSOPHICAL, RELIGIOUS AND OF COURSE, POLITICAL, CAME UP IN THE DISCUSSIONS. I LEARNED TO ADMIRE HIS PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE AND HIS WAY OF DECOMPRESSING AND BOILING IT DOWN TO NOT JUST THE CURRENT DAYS STATE OF AFFAIRS, BUT TO RELATING IT TO OUR HISTORY AS INDIVIDUAL OR AS A COUNTRY. AND SO TONIGHT, AS WE BEGIN TO LAY THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH OUR SPECIAL GUEST. I'D LIKE TO INVITE TO THE STAGE AND INTRODUCE A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING. [APPLAUSE] CONGRESSMAN KING: THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE IN THIS BUILDING, IN THIS ROOM AMONG ALL OF YOU. YOU TREAT ME THAT WELL WHEN I STEP OUT HERE. I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO SAY SOME THINGS. I WANT TO COMPRESS IT INTO A WAY THAT ADDS MEANING TO THE BALANCE OF WHAT WE'RE HEAR TONIGHT AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE VICTIMS OF THE PERSECUTION. WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS GREAT COUNTRY WE ARE, I PROFOUNDLY BELIEVE THAT GOD SHAPED THIS NATION WITH HIS HAND. [APPLAUSE] THAT HE SENT THE PILGRIMS AND THE OTHER SETTLERS OVER HERE TO THIS CONTINENT AND MOVED OUR FOUNDER FATHERS AROUND LIKE A CHESSBOARD TO SHAPE THIS GREAT NATION. I WOULD TAKE YOU BACK TO MOSAIC LAW. GOD SENT MOSES UP THE MOUNT TO COME DOWN WITH A TABLET, MOSAIC LAW. MANY CENTURIES LATER, I WOULD FIND MYSELF WANTING TO HEAR THE ARGUMENTS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT TO SET THE TABLETS UP IN PLACES LIKE TEXAS, THAT WAS THE MONTH OF JUNE. BUT IT WAS A BRIGHT DAY. IN 2005, I WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT BUILDING, I HAD A PERMISSION SLIP FROM THE JUSTICES TO HEAR THEIR ORAL ARGUMENTS. THE CROWD WAS SO THICK, I HAD TO CLIMB THROUGH THE HEDGE. I CLIMBED THROUGH THE HEDGE. I GO UP TO THE DOOR OF THE SUPREME COURT, MY PUPILS ARE SHRUNKEN DOWN AS THEY ARE. OPENED THE DOOR INTO THE DARKNESS, THERE STOOD A WHITE SHIRT AND I SAID, I'M CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING TO HEAR THE SUPREME COURT. THE MAN SAID, IN A DEEP VOICE, I'M MOSES AND I'M HEAR TO LEAD YOU. [LAUGHTER] NO KIDDING. NO KIDDING. MOSES LED ME IN AND MOSES LEAD ME OUT. UP IN FRONT OF THAT COURTROOM WAS GOING TO BE THE GENERAL OF THE STATE OF TEXAS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS NOW THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF TEXAS. [APPLAUSE] AND AND, I'M TEMPTED TO SAY THE LORD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MYSTERIOUS, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS. I REMEMBER A STATE SENATOR SAYING TO ME, WHY DO YOU THINK AMERICA IS GOD-SHAPED BY THE HAND OF GOD? I BELIEVE IT WAS HIS DIVINE GUIDANCE. HE SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT OF HISTORY. COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN SOME OTHER PLANET SOME OTHER PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE. NO, I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT. MOSAIC LAW WENT TO GREEKS. IT CAME FROM MOSES. ROMAN LAW IS WHAT JESUS DID. HE HAD A RIGHT TO FACE HIS ACCUSERS AND HE WAS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. REMEMBER WHEN THE HIGH PRIEST SAID DID YOU REALLY PREACH THOSE THINGS? DID YOU PREACH THOSE THINGS? HE SAID, ASK THEM, THEY WERE THERE. THE GUARD STRUCK JESUS. THE ANSWER WAS, HE HAD A RIGHT TO FACE HIS ACCUSERS. HE SAID, IF I HAVE SPOKEN WRONGLY, YOU MUST DO IT. INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. IT WAS SPREAD ALL ACROSS WESTERN EUROPE. IT GAVE US REDEMPTION AND ALL THE THINGS THAT CAME FROM JESUS FLOWS OUT OF US TODAY. IT WAS WITH ROMAN LAW AND WENT INTO THE DARK AGES AND FORGOT HOW TO THINK AND BROUGHT IT BACK BECAUSE THE BIBLE WAS PROTECTED AND PRESERVED AND THEY HAD TO RELEARN HOW TO THINK. THERE WAS THE FOUNDATION OF FREE ENTERPRISE CAPITALISM THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1776 THAT CAME OVER HERE TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAD PURITANS AND A CONCEPT OF MANIFEST. AT THE DAWN OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND WE DID SO IN THE BLINK OF A HISTORICAL EYE AND BECAME THE GREATEST NATION IN THE WORLD. HOW CAN ANYBODY THINK THAT THAT'S NOT THE HAND OF GOD? [APPLAUSE] AND, DID THEY UNDERSTAND THAT, THEN? OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DID, WE HOLD THEE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE TREATED EQUAL. BUT, 1865, FEBRUARY 12, THE WAR WASN'T OVER. IT WAS LINCOLN'S LAST BIRTHDAY, ON SUNDAY. THE FIRST BLACK PERSON ALLOWED TO SPEAK IN THE UNITED STATES CAPITAL BUILDING WHEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BELIEVED THAT LINCOLN JUST FREED THE SLAVES BEFORE THAT AND THEY BELIEVED THEY SHOULD HAVE A SERMON AND RELIGIOUS SERMON THERE. I'VE TAKEN SOME EXCERPTS FROM IT. IT TAKES ABOUT 40 SECONDS. A FORMER SLAVE, THEN PASTOR OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, WITH HIS BACKGROUND, HE UNDERSTOOD AND HE SPOKE TO THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. HE'S SPEAKING OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS. THEY HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE COURT OF HEAVEN THE MAGNA CARTA OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT WAS HANDED DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS IN AND AMID THE LIGHTS AND GIVEN BY THE SON OF GOD ON THE MOUNTS OF THE ATTITUDES WHILE THE GLORY SHOWN AROUND THEM. FROM THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THEY HAVE A GUARANTEE OF POLITICAL. FREEDOM TO WORSHIP GOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GOOGLE THAT AND READ THAT SPEECH. PUT YOURSELF IN A MINDSET OF THAT PLACE AND THAT TIME, LINCOLN'S LAST BIRTHDAY, NEAR THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR AND THE RIGHTS COMING FROM GOD AND THINK, DO OUR CHILDREN KNOW THIS? WILL OUR GRANDCHILDREN KNOW THIS? WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE THAT RIGHTS COME FROM GOD. IF THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE THEM AWAY. THEY'RE UNALIENABLE. STEP UP AND DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS THAT COME FROM GOD, THAT ARE ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION. BE NOT AFRAID. BE BOLD, BE NOBLE, PREACH THE WORD. IF THEY TAKE AWAY YOUR 501 NOT-FOR-PROFIT STATUS, IS ANYONE IN THIS FOR PROFIT ANYWAY? IF YOU NEED HELP, CALL ME. I'LL PRAY FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE THERE AND YOU'RE BOLD. WE'VE GOT TO BE CONFIDENT AND I RECALL A TIME I WAS GIVING A SPEECH OUT ON THE COURTHOUSE AND AN INDIVIDUAL CAME OUT AND HE SAID, YOU CAN'T SPEAK HERE. THIS IS ELECTION YEAR AND WE HAVE ELECTIONS HERE. HE SAID, IF YOU CAN'T EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT HERE ON THE COURTHOUSE LAWN, WHERE IN THE WORLD CAN YOU? I'M GLAD WE'RE STANDING HERE TODAY AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THESE STORIES AND NARRATIVES AND WE HAVE A LEADER WHO HAS STEPPED UP FOR OUR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THE BOY SCOUT, THAT ALL CAME FROM TED CRUZ. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HE'S BROUGHT US HERE TOGETHER TO NIGHT TO PRAY AND LEARN AND TO BE ENERGIZED. IF WE DON'T USE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, WE WILL LOSE THEM. I WILL INTRODUCE, THERE WILL BE A VIDEO THAT FOLLOWS ME. IT IS FROM THE LIBERTY INSTITUTE, ONE OF THE TOP CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS IN OUR COUNTRY. HE'S GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND DEFENDING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. >> I'VE BEEN DOING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CASES FOR OVER 26 YEARS. I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IN THE QUARTER-CENTURY, I'VE NEVER SEEN WHAT I SEE NOW. OVER 1,600 PUBLISHED ATTACKS, NOT INCLUDING THE ONES THAT AREN'T PUBLISHED IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING EACH YEAR. THEY ARE DOUBLING FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. CASES ARE A LITTLE 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL PRAYING OVER HER MEAL AND ORDERED TO STOP AND TOLD, QUOTE, IT IS NOT GOOD TO PRAY AT SCHOOL. SENIOR CITIZENS WERE THREATENED TO HAVE THEIR MEALS TAKEN AWAY. THEY SAID IT WOULD VIOLATE SEPRAGDZ -- SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. IT IS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUNG, OLDER. THE ATTACKS ARE PERVASIVE. TONIGHT, ALONE, YOU WILL HEAR FROM PASTORS WHO HAVE BEEN FINED AND HAD THEIR CHAPEL CLOSED BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ENGAGE IN VIOLATION OF THEIR FAITH. YOU'LL HEAR FROM A COUPLE WHO HAD THEIR BUSINESS DESTROYED AND A $250,000 FINE ASSESSED AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN A WEDDING THAT WOULD VIOLATE THEIR FAITH. YOU'LL HEAR FROM A 72-YEAR-OLD WHO MIGHT LOSE THEIR HOME. YOU'LL HEAR FROM AN AIR FORCE VETERAN AND HERO WHO GAVE HIS ALL FOR 19 YEARS AND ONLY TO BE ATTACKED FOR HIS FAITH, RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES. THE STORIES YOU WILL HEAR ARE FROM ORDINARY CITIZENS AND THEY'RE A WAKE UP CALL TO A NATION. OUR FOUNDERS CALLED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OUR FIRST FREEDOM. THEY DO SO NOT BECAUSE IT'S IN THE FIRST TWO CLAUSES OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT BECAUSE THEY KNEW IF YOU LOSE YOUR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, YOU'LL LOSE ALL YOUR FREEDOM. THERE IS NO BETTER PERSON TO DO THIS THAN TED CRUZ. NOT BECAUSE HIS FATHER IS A PASTOR. MANY KNOW OF HIS BRILLIANCE AND HIS CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTISE. SOMETHING FEW KNOW, HE WAS GIVING TIME FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND DONATED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF TIME FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CASES. IT WAS A GREAT SACRIFICE IN TIME AND MONEY BECAUSE IT IS A PRIORITY AND A COMMITMENT. WHEN THE MOJAVE CROSS WAS ATTACKED, HE DONATED HIS TIME TO STAND WITH ME AND WITH LIBERTY INSTITUTE IN REPRESENTING MILLIONS OF VETERANS, THE VFW, THE PURPLE HEART, AND AMERICA EX-PRISONERS OF WAR. THIS 70-YEAR-OLD MEMORIAL, WAS ORDERED TO BE TORN DOWN BY THE LOWER COURTS AND TO BE COVERED WHILE THE CASE WENT ON APPEAL. THE CROSS WAS COVERED WITH A BAG AND THEN A CHAIN WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE BOTTOM WITH A PADLOCK. AS THE U.S. U.S. SUPREME COURT, THE BAG IS OFF, THE CHAIN IS OFF. TED GAVE HIS TALENT, FREE OF CHARGE, TO MILLIONS. IF ANYONE HAS THE BACKGROUND, THE COMMITMENT AND THE UNDERSTANDING TO COVER THIS ISSUE, IT IS TED CRUZ. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR HIM, AS A FRIENDS, A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER AND AS A LEADER, PROTECTING OUR FIRST FREEDOM. GOD BLESS YOU, TED CRUZ, AND THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS VERY IMPORTANT RALLY. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE STAGE, BRIAN ENGLISH. [APPLAUSE] MR. ENGLISH: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TED CRUZ CAN PUT TOGETHER AN INTERESTING GROUP OF TEENS. I WANT TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER PATRIOT, SOMEBODY WHO MANY OF YOU KNOW AND AFTER YOU'VE HEARD HIM SPEAK HERE, YOU'RE ALL GOING TO LOVE HIM. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE STATE CHAIRMAN FOR OUR CAMPAIGN, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, MATT SCHULTZ. [APPLAUSE] MR. SCHULTZ: IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT. IT'S A BIGGER HONOR TO SERVE AS TED CRUZ STATE CHAIR. I LOVE THIS MAN, LET ME TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE HE'S HONEST. HE'S HONEST AND HE STANDS UP AND HE FIGHTS FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES IN AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. WE'RE AT A CROSS ROAD IN OUR COUNTRY. WE SEE THE EROSION OF OUR FAMILIES. OUR CONSTITUTION'S BEING SHREDDED, THEY CARE MORE ABOUT ABOUT CECIL THE LION THAN THEY DO ABOUT THE UNBORN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M MARRIED AND I HAVE FIVE KIDS AND I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE OUR COUNTRY'S GOING. WE NEED A CHAMPION, A COURAGEOUS CONSERVATIVE, SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR US. YOU KNOW, I THINK ABOUT OUR SAVIOR, WHEN WE WENT TO THE TEMPLE AND SAW THE MONEY-CHANGERS, WHAT DID WE DO? HE THREW THEM OUT. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND THROW THE MONEY CHANGERS OUT AND STOP THE WASHINGTON CARTEL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHEN YOU READ THE SCRIPTURES, WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY, YOU CAN SEE THAT GOD PREPARES AND RAISES SPECIAL MEN AND WOMEN TO PROTECT AND FIGHT FOR HIS PEOPLE. AND I BELIEVE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN TIME. FRZ TED CRUZ IS THAT MAN WHO GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT IN TIME, TO BE OUR CHAMPION, TO FIGHT FOR OUR HUSBANDS, OUR WIVES, OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN, FOR OUR COUNTRY. TED CRUZ WILL RESTORE OUR CONSTITUTION. HE WILL RESTORE OUR BELIEF IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING TED CRUZ AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO STAND WITH ME IN SUPPORTING MY FRIEND, OUR SPECIAL PERSON, TEXAS SENATOR, TED CRUZ, LET'S GIVE HIM A WARM WELCOME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] >> SHOW US THOSE SIGNS, EVERYBODY. LET'S SEE THOSE SIGNS. SHOW YOUR SUPPORT. MR. CRUZ: THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS THE GREAT STATE OF IOWA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW THE WORD TELLS US, WHERE TWO OR MORE ARE GATHERED IN HIS NAME, HE WILL BE WITH US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GATHERING THIS IS, FROM ACROSS THIS STATE, HOW HONORED AND HUMBLED I AM TO BE STANDING WITH SO MANY PATRIOTS HERE IN THIS ROOM AND WITH SO MANY HEROES WHO HAVE GATHERED TO TELL US THEIR TALE OF COURAGE. YOU KNOW, THIS NATION, THIS NATION WE LOVE IS UNIQUE IN THE ANNALS OF THE HISTORY OF THE WORD. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED BY MEN AND WOMEN FLEEING RELIGIOUS OPPRESSION. FLEEING KINGS AND MONARCHS WHO WOULD OPRESS THEM, WHO WOULD TELL THEM WHO YOU MAY WORSHIP AND WHO YOU MAY NOT. AND MEN AND WOMEN FLED FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME TO THE NEW WORLD. TO SEEK OUT A LAND WHERE EVERY ONE OF US COULD WORSHIP THE GOD, ALMIGHTY, WITH OUR MINDS AND SOULS, FREE OF THE GOVERNMENT GETTING IN THE WAY. OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED WITH THE BLOODY REVOLUTION. A BLOODY REVOLUTION THAT UNDER ORDINARY REASON, HAD NO BUSINESS SUCCEEDING. A HAPLESS GROUP OF COLONISTS DECLARED WAR ON THE MIGHTEST ARMY ON THE PLANET AND YET WITH GOD'S PROVIDENTIAL BLESSING, AMERICA PREVAILED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT THERE WAS A SECOND REVOLUTION, A REVOLUTION MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REVOLUTION FOUGHT WITH GUNS AND BAYENTS. IT WAS THE REVOLUTION OF IDEAS. FOR MILLENNIA, MAN HAD BEEN TOLD THAT OUR RIGHTS COME FROM KINGS AND QUEENS. HANDED DOWN LIKE CRUMBS. BY THE MONARCH TO BE TAKEN AWAY BY THE WIN OF THE MONARCH. OUR COUNTRY BEGAN WITH A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION, THAT IT DOES NOT COME FROM GOVERNMENT BUT FROM ALMIGHTY GOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AS THE DECLARATION PUT IT SO POWERFULLY, WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE HELD SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. NOT BY A KING, QUEEN, PRESIDENT. THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. WITH THOSE WORDS, THIS NATION SPRUNG INTO EXISTENCE. THERE IS A REASON WHY, IN THE CONSTITUTION IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS, THE VERY FIRST PROTECTION IN THE VERY FIRST AMENDMENT IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. IF WE CANNOT WORSHIP GOD, IF WE CANNOT LIVE ACCORDING TO OUR FAITH, ALL OTHER LIBERTIES FADE AWAY. YOU KNOW, STEVE TALKED ABOUT THE TEN COMMANDMENTS CASE IN TEXAS. IT CONCERNED A MONUMENT THAT HAD STOOD THERE SINCE 1961. WAS ERECTED, STOOD THERE FOR DECADES, DISTURBING NOBODY ON THE STATE CAPITAL GROUNDS UNTIL AN INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFF, AN ATHEIST, A HOMELESS MAN WALKED PAST THE MONUMENT AND DECIDED IT OFFENDED HIM AND HE FILED A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO TEAR DOWN THAT MONUMENT. WHEN THAT CASE WHEN TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, WHEN WE ARGUED THAT CASE, DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW MANY TIMES IN THE COURTROOM OF THE UNITED STATES COURT, THE IMAGE OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS APPEARS? 43 TIMES. THAT'S VERY GOOD. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] 43 TIMES, 40 TIMES, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ARE ON THE BRASS GATES ON THE SIDE OF THE COURTROOM. WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE CORT ROOM, THERE ARE TWO WOODEN DOORS AND THERE ARE TWO MORE IMAGES. YOU CANNOT WALK OUT OF THE COURTROOM WITHOUT SEEING THE TEN COMMANDMENTS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU. WHEN THOSE JUSTICES HEARD THE ORAL ARGUMENT, RIGHT ABOVE THEIR LEFT SHOULDER WAS MOSES HOLDING THE 10 COMMANDSUOMMANDCOMMANDMENTS, LOOKING DOWN UPON THEM. NOW, WE WON THAT CASE. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE WON IT 5-4. FOUR JUSTICES WERE WILLING TO ORDER THE STATE OF TEXAS TO TEAR DOWN THAT MONUMENT THAT HAS STOOD ON THE CAPITAL GROUND SINCE 1961. WE WERE ONE JUSTICE AWAY. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT, WE'RE ONE JUSTICE AWAY FROM THE SUPREME COURT SAYING EVERY STATUE BE TORN DOWN. KELLY TALKED ABOUT THE MOJAVE VETERANS MEMORIAL CASE, A CROSS SEVEN FEET TALL. ONCE AGAIN, A PLAINTIFF CAME AND SUED. THE PLAINTIFF SAID THERE IMAGE OF A CROSS CANNOT BE SEEN ON FEDERAL LANDS. HERE IN IOWA, THERE'S LITIGATION CONCERNING EXACTLY THAT TODAY. I WILL SAY THIS, THE PLAINTIFFS WERE RIGHT ON ONE THING, THE CROSS HAS POWER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'LL TELL YOU, IT WAS HUMBLING, IT WAS MOVING TO REPRESENT VETERANS STANDING BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND WE WON THAT CASE, ALSO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT ONCE AGAIN, IT WAS 5-4. FOUR JUSTICES WERE WILLING TO SAY THIS MONUMENT TO OUR VETERANS MUST BE TORN TO THE GROUND. ANYONE WHO'S VISITED ARLINGTON CEMETERY AND SEEN ROW AFTER ROW WITH A CROSS OF A STAR OF DAVEID, HONORING OUR SOLDIERS WHO GAVE THE LAST OF THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE, WE'RE ONE JUSTICE AWAY FROM THE SUPREME COURT SAYING, WE MUST TEAR THOSE DOWN. AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY, THESE THREATS HAVE BEEN GROWING. THEY HAVE BEEN GROWING FOR DECADES, BUT NEVER HAVE THE THREATS HAVE BEEN GREATER TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW AND HERE TODAY. . YOU KNOW, MANY IN THE MEDIA SAY THESE THREATS DON'T EXIST. THEY'RE NOT REAL. WELL, THE PURPOSE OF THIS GATHERING IS TO PUT A NAME AND A FACE TO THESE HEROES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EVENING IS TO TELL THEIR STORIES. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A REASON JESUS SPOKE IN PARABLES. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE UNDERSTAND, THAT'S WHAT TOUCHES OUR HEART, THAT'S WHAT MOVES US. SO IT IS MY HOPE THAT ALL OF US GATHERED HERE TODAY, ALL OF THE HOME PARTIES, ALL OF THE CHURCHES THAT ARE WATCHING ONLINE, BELIEVERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WILL COME TO KNOW AND LOVE THESE ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE LIVING THEIR LIVES. THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR CONFLICT. THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR CONFRONTATION AND THE GOVERNMENT CAME AFTER THEM AND SAID CHOOSE YOUR FAITH OR OBEDIENCE TO POWER AND THEY SAID, I FOLLOW A HIGHER POWER AND THAT IS GOD ALMIGHTY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND SO, IN TELLING THESE STORIES, I WANT TO START WITH ONE THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW ALREADY. RESIDENTS OF IOWA, IOWA'S OWN DICK AND BETTY. [APPLAUSE] FROM IOWA, THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLE COUPLE. A COUPLE I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW QUITE WELL. I WANT TO START SIMPLY BY PLAYING A VIDEO AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO INVITE, AT THE SAME TIME, DICK AND BETTY TO THE STAGE AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. LET'S START THE VIDEO. >> I'M HERE WITH DICK AND BETTY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR INCREDIBLE JOURNEY. THEY INSPIRE ME AND I AM THRILLED TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO SHARE THEIR STORY. SO, TELL US ABOUT THIS CHURCH? WHEN DID YOU OPEN IT UP TO HOSTING WEDDINGS? >> IN 2008. WE HAD BEAUTIFUL WEDDINGS IN HERE FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS. >> I GUESS YOU NATURALLY HAVE THE FLOWER BUSINESS. >> WE WOULD DO THE RECEPTION AND THE FOOD AS WELL. AND THEN IN 2009, THE IOWA LAW CHANGED TO INCLUDE SAME-SEX WEDDINGS. SO THEN, IN AUGUST OF 2013, TWO GENTLEMEN CAME IN AND DICK HAD TO DELIVER THE BAD NEWS. THEY LEFT, WE DIDN'T KNOW. THE VERY NEXT DAY, IT WAS ON A SUNDAY, WE GOT THE NEWS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PROBABLY SUE. >> I GUESS THEY FILED A COMPLAINTS THE DAY AFTER? >> YES. >> OF COURSE, IT WENT VIRAL. >> IT WAS DEVASTATING TO HEAR THAT WE WERE BIGOTS, WE WERE HOMOPHOBS. >> YOUR WEDDING WAS CONTRARY TO YOUR -- >> I WAS THINKING, THEY DON'T KNOW US. HOW COULD THEY BE CALLING US ALL THESE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING. WE HAVE NO HATRED TOWARD GAY PEOPLE. >> YOU HAVE BEEN, FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, HOSTING WEDDINGS IN THIS HISTORIC CHURCH. AS A RESULT OF THIS LITIGATION, YOU STOPPED WEDDINGS. >> WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHURCH. >> THAT HAS BEEN QUITE PAINFUL. AS A RESULT OF THAT, THE BUSINESS HAS DECLINED AND WE CAN'T SUPPORT IT SO WE'RE -- BY THE END OF AUGUST, WE'LL BE SHUTTING OUR DOORS. >> AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. >> I'LL TELL YOU, OUR COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO RISKED EVERYTHING FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE OF THE GOVERNMENT GETTING IN THE WAY AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU, NUMBER ONE, FOR TAKING A STAND. BUT NUMBER TWO, FOR TELLING YOUR STORY. YOUR STORY IS POWERFUL, YOUR STORY'S INSPIRATIONAL AND INSPIRES ME. >> WHAT WE HOPE WE CAN DO IS TRY TO CHANGE THE COURSE AS BEST WE CAN IN THE YEARS WE HAVE LEFT. >> WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONVICTION. >> SO NICE HAVING YOU. >> THANK YOU, DICK. [APPLAUSE] >> DICK AND BETTY. [APPLAUSE] >> BETTY, DICK, THANK YOU FOR THE COURAGE OF YOUR CONVICTIONS. THANK YOU FOR TELLING YOUR STORY. LET ME ASK YOU, WHY DID YOU FIRST BEGIN HOSTING WEDDINGS IN THE CHURCH THAT TO TWO OF YOU OWN? >> WE LOVE WEDDINGS. WE LOVE THAT BUSINESS. LOVE TO DO THE FLOWERS AND WE HAD A RESTAURANT AND WE HAD EVERYTHING ALL IN ONE LOCATION. WE HAD SOME BEAUTIFUL EVENTS. >> AND TELL ME, TELL ALL OF US, WHAT YOUR FAITH MEANS TO YOU. >> EVERYTHING. IT GOES TO THE CORE OF OUR BEING. HOW WE LIVE OUR LIFE. >> WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND OUT YOU WERE BEING SUED, HOW DID THAT IMPACT THE TWO OF YOU? >> WELL, THE WHOLE EVENT WAS DEVASTATING. PERSONALLY, IT BROUGHT ME DOWN. I KNEW THAT IT WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME. AND -- MR. CRUZ: LET ME ASK YOU WHAT A CYNIC, WHAT A SKEPTICAL PERSON MIGHT SAY. WHICH IS, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GIVE IN? WHAT DIDN'T YOU JUST AGREE TO ALLOW THE SAME-SEX WEDDING TO BE CELEBRATING? >> WE COULD NOT CELEBRATE A SIN. WE COULD NOT TAKE PART IN WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A SIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MR. CRUZ: I SUPPOSE THE MEDIA WOULD SAY IT'S AN EASY THING TO ROLL OVER AND ACCEPT IT AND EMBRACE IT AND SAY IT'S RIGHT. YET, YOUR FAITH WOULDN'T ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT BETTY: OF COURSE NOT. MR. CRUZ: LITIGATION WENT ON FOR 18 MONTHS. AND THEN YOU PERSONALLY PAID $5,000, SETTLE THE MATTER. AND HAS THERE BEEN ANOTHER WEDDING? >> BETTY: NO. >> DICK: THE LAST WEDDING WAS NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. WE SIMPLY HAD TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS, WE'RE AT RISK. IT WAS WELL-PUBLICIZED WHAT OUR FAITH WAS AND WHAT IT IS AND WE COULD NOT TAKE THE RISK AND PUT OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT WEDGE. MR. CRUZ: AND THEN EARLIER THIS MONTH, YOU CLOSED THE BUSINESS ALL TOGETHER? >> DICK: JULY 31 MR. CRUZ: TELL US WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU, TO CLOSE THAT BUSINESS, HOSTING WEDDINGS THAT YOU LOVED SO MUCH. TELL US WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE TWO OF YOU. BETTY: THIS WAS MY PASSION. WE WORKED FOR 13 AND A HALF YEARS TO BUILD THIS BUSINESS AND WE LIVED THERE SIX DAYS A WEEK AND JUST LOVED IT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CLOSE THE DOORS AND WALK AWAY. IT'S HARD TO PACK UP. >> DICK: IT LOOKED MUCH DIFFERENT PREPARING FOR AN AUCTION THAN PREPARING FOR A WEDDING, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TODAY. >> MR. CRUZ: HAS THAT OCCURRED YET? >> DICK: OCTOBER 3. >> MR. CRUZ: YOU HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORK FOR YOU IN THE FLOWER BUSINESS. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EMPLOYEES? >> BETTY: THEY HAVE TO WORK ELSEWHERE. >> MR. CRUZ: SO THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF BUSINESS. >> BETTY: ABSOLUTELY. >> MR. CRUZ: YOUR EMPLOYEES HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. TELL ME ABOUT THE PUBLIC REACTION. >> DICK: CONFUSING, ACTUALLY. WE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORTERS. AND WE CHERISHED THOSE FOLKS. THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT IT IS, MANY OF THOSE SUPPORTERS DIDN'T WANT TO SUPPORT US PUBLICLY OUT OF FEAR OF REPRISAL. I DON'T KNOW, YOU'D HAVE TO TALK TO THOSE FOLKS. SO THAT HURT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE LEARNED MORE ABOUT PEOPLE THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT WE KNEW. >> MR. CRUZ: I KNOW A LOT OF UGLENESS WAS DIRECTED TOWARD THE TWO OF YOU. >> BETTY: UNBELIEVABLE. NEVER HAD EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE. SOME PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS THAT COME AFTER YOU. THIS IS BRAND NEW TO US AND IT REALLY TOOK US BY SURPRISE TO BE CALLED A HATER AND A BIGOT, JUST OVERNIGHT, YOU BECOME SOMETHING YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE YOURSELF. >> MR. CRUZ: I KNOW THE TERMS USED TO ATTACK YOU BY POLITICAL ACTIVISTS AND THE MEDIA. ATTEMPT TO CHARACTERIZE YOU AND ME AS SOMEHOW INTOLERANT AND YET, WHAT IS THE TOLERANCE THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO YOU, FOR FOLLOWING A BIBLICAL TEACHING, THAT MARRIAGE IS ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] >> BETTY: EXACTLY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] >> MR. CRUZ: THESE TWO MEN WHO WANTED TO GET MARRIED, THERE WERE OTHER FACILITIES TO DO THAT, CORRECT? >> BETTY: OF COURSE. >> MR. CRUZ MR. CRUZ: BUT THEY WANTED IT IN YOUR CHURCH. I KNOW BETTY, IN PARTICULAR, THIS HAS BEEN -- BETTY: DON'T MAKE ME CRY. [LAUGHTER] MR. CRUZ: I'M CONVINCED YOU HAVE GONE DOWN THIS JOURNEY. YOU HAVE ENDURED THE ATTACKS. YOU HAVE ENDURED THE HATRED PRECISELY PUTS YOU WHERE YOU ARE HERE TODAY FOR SUCH A TIME. BETTY: I AGREE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MR. CRUZ: DICK, YOU TALKED ABOUT NOT KNOWING WHERE YOUR FRIENDS ARE. THERE ARE 3,000 PEOPLE FROM IOWA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MR. CRUZ: AND THERE ARE CHURCH GROUPS LIFTING YOU UP IN PRAYER. YOUR FAITH AND ENCOURAGE, THEY INSPIRE EVERY ONE OF US TO STAND WITH YOU. THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] >> GENTLEMAN, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE, BRIAN ENGLISH. [APPLAUSE] BRIAN ENGLISH: THEY ARE A TREASURE HERE IN IOWA. [APPLAUSE] WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAID, YOU WILL COMPLY AND VIOLATE YOUR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS, THEY SAID NO. AND WE'RE PROUD OF THEM. [APPLAUSE] BUT THEY'RE NOT ALONE, UNFORTUNATELY, IN BEING PUT INTO THAT SITUATION. TONIGHT, WE'LL MEET OTHER FOLKS. THE PERSON THAT IS GOING TO VISIT WITH THEM IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. HE HAS AN AMAZING ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE BIBLICAL TRUTH AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT CUTS THROUGH THE NOISE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT, OUR SOCIETY AND HE DOES IT IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS OFTEN VERY HOSTILE TO THE GOSPEL. SO, I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO WELCOME TO THE STAGE, THIS EVENING, A GOOD FRIEND, ANOTHER TREASURE HERE IN THE STATE OF IOWA, STEVE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STEVE: I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A REPUTATION FOR BEING KIND OF FIERY. WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE IS GOING TO MAKE YOU ANGRY. IT'S GOING TO FIRE YOU UP. IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHTEOUS ANGER BUT IN OUR ANGER, WE DO NOT SIN. SAL IS TRAVELING TO KILL CHRISTIANS. THE FAMOUS STORY, HE ENCOUNTERS THE LIVING GOD IN THE FLESH, JESUS CHRIST, WHO STOPS HIM ON THE ROAD AND SAID, WHY ARE YOU PERSECUTING MY PEOPLE? NO, THAT IS NOT WHAT CHRIST SAYS, HE SAYS, WHY ARE YOU PERSECUTING ME? AND WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT US. THIS IS ABOUT THE GOD WE SERVE. AND THE SAL THAT HAD THAT MOMENT, LATER WRITES THESE WORDS, LIARS, THIEVES, FORMICATORS, MURDERS, WILL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, THAT IS A HARSH TEACHING AND SAYS, SUCH AS ONCE FOR SOME OF YOU. ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM, IF WE CLAIM CHRIST AS LORD, HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY WE NEEDED A SAVIOR. [APPLAUSE] AT JUST AS HE DIED FOR US, AND DIED FOR THE HEROES YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM IN A FEW MOMENTS, WE ALSO DIED FOR THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PERSECUTION. HE WANTS TO REDEEM THEM AS WELL, HE MADE THEM AS WELL. HE COUNTED THE HAIRS ON THEIR HEADS AS WELL. HE KNOWS THE NUMBER OF THEIR DAYS AS WELL. LET US NOT FORGET THAT BECAUSE IN THE END, THIS ISN'T A POLITICAL STRUGGLE, THIS IS NOT AN IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE. THIS IS A STRUGGLE FOR THE SOUL. NOT LET'S MEET SOME PEOPLE THROUGH THIS VIDEO THAT UNDERSTAND. WHEN IT WAS THEIR TURN, THEY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. >> WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT TELL YOU THAT YOU DON'T HAVE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, NOW THAT, THAT IS VERY DISHEARTENING. >> IT'S LIKE IF I DON'T HAVE THE FIRST FREEDOM, MY RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, WHAT'S THE POINT? >> I DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT MY CAREER WOULD END UNDER SUCH TERMS. >> NO WAY WOULD I EVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE IN THIS POSITION. I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND FREEDOM IN A DIFFERENT WAY. . >> I BELIEVE THAT THE FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN MY LIFE, HAVE PROVEN THAT A POOR KID FROM AN AT-RISK FAMILY AND A SINGLE MOM WITH SIX CHILDREN WITH WELFARE AND FOOD STAMPS, LIVING IN POVERTY, CAN HAVE DREAMS CAN COME TRUE. >> THE FREEDOMS WE ENJOY TO COME HOME LATER AND BE TOLD THAT BECAUSE I HOLD A RELIGIOUS BELIEF, SOME SORT OF DISCRIMINATION? >> AT THE DARKEST HOUR, OUR CHURCH SHOWED UP AND THE FAMILY RALLIED AROUND US AND PRAYED FOR US AND THAT WAS A BIG THING FOR US. >> YOU GET TO SEE THE FULLNESS OF GOD WHEN YOU STAND UP FOR HIS TRUTH, HIS WORD. >> WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS HIS FAITHFULNESS AND HIS PROMISES. YOU READ THOSE AND YOU SAY, YEAH, RIGHT. >> I'VE ALREADY HAD MY WORST DAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND SO, WHAT'S OUR -- >> OUR KIDS HAVE SEEN THAT THERE'S A REAL COST TO SERVING THE LORD. . >> WHY WOULD I, THE BUSINESS OWNER, WANT TO BRING THIS ON MY COMPANY? ANYTHING, I WOULD WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS. >> WHAT GOT ME MY JOB HAS ULTIMATELY COST ME MY JOB. . >> I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND FREEDOM IN A DIFFERENT WAY. BEFORE, IT WAS SORT OF OFF HERE IN ANOTHER WORLD BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOU -- AND IT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU -- WHEN THEY COME TO TAKE THAT AWAY, IT TAKES ON A WHOLE NEW MEANING. . >> IN ORDER TO NOT RALLY MY CONSCIOUS. I HAVE NO REGRETS. I'M PRAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT GOD WOULD SEE THIS THROUGH. >> LOSING THE BUSINESS WAS VERY HARD FOR ME. [CRYING] I WORKED REALLY HARD TO BUILD IT UP. UP. I PUT A LOT INTO IT. VERY HARD. >> OUR DEFINITION OF FREEDOM, IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IS CHANGING RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES. I BELIEVE THAT THOSE VERY FREEDOMS ARE AT RISK IN OUR BELOVED UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TODAY. >> BEFORE ALL OF THIS WENT ON, I FELT LIKE THERE WAS FREEDOM. THAT WE HAD ALL KINDS OF FREEDOM. GOING THROUGH ALL THIS NOW, I'M DEFINITELY SEEING A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD AND FEELING LIKE DEFINITELY FREEDOM, ESPECIALLY RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, IS REALLY AT RISK. >> DO I THINK SO MUCH LESS OF HIM THAT I WOULDN'T STAND UP FOR HIM? [APPLAUSE] >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME OUR HEROES TO THE STAGE. [APPLAUSE] (music) [MUSIC](music) [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MR. CRUZ: THANK YOU, YOU MAY BE SEATED. I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE REALLY NERVOUS. LET'S START WITH AN ICE BREAKER MESSAGE. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU SIGNED UP TO ENLIST IN A CULTURE WAR? NO? NO? ALL RIGHT, SO, HERE'S THE REASON I ASK THAT QUESTION, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE BAKERS, A FLORIST, SHIRT MAKER, MILITARY MAN AND A FIREMAN. EVERY DAY PEOPLE. EVERYDAY PEOPLE. THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT MAJORED IN CULTURE WAR, THEY'RE NOT UNITED STATES SENATORS, THESE ARE JUST EVERY DAY PEOPLE, LIKE ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM. AND YET THEY FIND THEMSELVES ON THE FRONTLINE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS CULTURE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF YOU IN YOUR SEATS, ENJOYING YOUR COMFORT AND YOUR AIR CONDITIONING, YOU MAY GO HOME TO YOUR FARMS AND BUSINESSES AND CHURCHES AND THINK THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN TO YOU. I'D BE WILLING TO BET THE SIX PEOPLE ON THE STAGE THOUGHT THE SAME THING. THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN TO THEM AND THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN TO THEM. I WANT TO START WITH YOU, CHIEF COCKRAN. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO BE A FIREMAN? WHAT KIND OF TRAINING DOES IT TAKE? >> I WAS BORN IN POVERTY IN LOUISIANA AND I WAS ONE OF SIX KIDS. MY DAD LEFT MY MOTHER AND SHE RAISED ALL SIX OF US BY HERSELF. WE MOVED TO AN ALLEY IN A SHOTGUN HOUSE. ONE SUNDAY AFTER CHURCH, WE HEARD A SIREN AND THERE WAS A FIRE TRUCK IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE. THE HOUSE ACROSS THEALLY FROM US WAS ON FIRE AND I WANTED TO BE A FIREFIGHTER WHEN I GREW UP. THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT AS A LITTLE KID. I WANTED TO BE A FIREFIGHTER, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE POOR. I WANTED A FAMILY BECAUSE I REALIZED HOW AWFUL IT WAS TO NOT HAVE A DAD AT HOME. THEY TOLD US ALL OF OUR DREAMS WOULD COME TRUE IF WE BELIEVED IN AND HAD FAITH IN GOD AND WENT TO SCHOOL AND GOT A GOOD EDUCATION. SO, THEY SAID PATRIOTISM IN US. IN 1981, MY CHILDHOOD DREAM CAME TRUE, I BECAME A FIREFIGHTER. WITH 18 YEARS, I BELIEVE THE FIRE CHIEF. IN 2008, I WAS APOINTED FIRE CHIEF IN ATLANTA. I DID THAT FOR 20 MONTHS, THEN I WAS APOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TO HEAD THE FIRE ADMINISTRATION. I WAS RECRUITED BACK TO ATLANTA ONE YEAR LATER AND SERVED HIM UNTIL JANUARY 6 OF THIS YEAR WHEN I WAS TERMINATED FOR EMPLOYMENT. SO MY CHILDHOOD CAME TRUE AND FAIRY TALE CAREER ENDED. >> YOU ARE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THIS IS THE AMERICAN DREAM RIGHT HERE. IF YOU LOST YOUR JOB -- AB ABSOLUTELY APPLAUD THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> GIVEN ALL OF THE MERIT BADGES YOU'VE EARNED ALL THE WAY THROUGH LIFE, YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG IN YOUR JOB TO CAUSE YOU TO BE FIRED, EXCEPT THAT WASN'T THE CASE. IN FACT, YOU WERE FIRED FOR NO REASON, FOR NOTHING ABOUT YOUR JOB BUT FOR SIMPLY WRITING A BOOK. >> ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO, I WAS CONDUCTING A MEN'S SMALL BIBLE STUDY AND I ASKED THE MEN, OUR MEN TODAY, STILL SUFFERING FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT ADAM DID IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, OF COURSE ALL OF THEM SAID YES AND I ASKED THEM TO TELL ME WHY AND AS THEY TALKED, THE QUESTION GOT TO ABOUT -- I WAS SO CURIOUS, I RESEARCHED THE WORD, NAKED, TO SEE IF GOD WAS ASKING HIM MORE THAN IF YOU HAD ANYTHING MORE ON THAN CLOSED. NAKED MEANT DEPRIVED SO I RESEARCHED THE WORD, CLOTHED, WHICH MEANT REDEEMED AND RESTORED. SO IT SAYS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED HAVE BEEN CLOTHED IN CHRIST. THERE ARE TOO MANY CHRISTIAN MEN, CLOTHED MEN TODAY, STILL ACTING LIKE NAKED MEN AND I NEED TO ASK THEM TODAY, WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE NAKED AND THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK IS ALL ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] THE PART THAT GOT ME IN TROUBLE IS THAT I DEALT WITH SEXUAL CHALLENGES THAT MARRIED MEN HAVE AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE TROUBLE THAT LED TO MY 30-DAY SUSPENSION AND SUBSEQUENT SUSPENSION WITH THE CITY OF ATLANTA. >> WHAT YOU JUST HEARD IS AN AMAZING STORY. NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS RECORD, AT ALL. TO THE POINT THAT HE IS APPOINTED TO ONE OF THE HIGHEST POSTS YOU CAN BE AS A FIREMAN, WORKING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOR EXPRESSING HIS VIEWPOINT IN HIS OWN PRIVATE TIME, HIS OWN PRIVATE TIME, LET THAT SINK IN FOR A MOMENT. HIS OWN PRIVATE TIME, HE LOSES EVERYTHING. WE'LL BRING YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION NEXT, BECAUSE YOUR STORY IS VERY WELL-KNOWN, TO OUR AUDIENCE. A LOT OF THEM LISTEN TO MY RADIO SHOW AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE YOUR STORY VERY WELL-KNOWN AND ALL OF YOUR STORIES WELL-KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. IT'S JUST FLOWERS. YOU'RE JUST SELLING FLOWERS. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? WHY NOT JUST SELL THE FLOWERS? YOU SOLD THEM TO THIS CLIENTS SO MANY TIMES, WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS TIME? >> THIS TIME IT WAS ABOUT A MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. WHEN HE CAME IN AND ASKED ME TO TALK ABOUT HIS WEDDING, I PUT MY HANDS ON HIS AND SAID, I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO YOUR WEDDING BECAUSE OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST AND HE SAID I UNDERSTAND AND WE TALKED ABOUT HIS MOM AND HIS ENGAGEMENT AND WHY HE DECIDED TO GET MARRIED. HE ASKED ME FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANOTHER FLORIST, I GAVE HIM NAMES OF ANOTHER FLORIST WHO WOULD DO A GREAT JOB. WE HUGGED EACH OTHER AND ROB LEFT. WHEN I DO A WEDDING, I PUT EVERYTHING IN IT. I COULDN'T DO ROB'S BECAUSE IT WOULD DISHONOR CHRIST. IT'S PART OF YOU, IT'S WHAT YOU MAKE, IT'S WHAT YOU CREATE AND WHAT YOU CELEBRATE. AS MUCH AS I LOVE ROB, I COULDN'T CELEBRATE HIS WEDDING. >> YOU MENTIONED THIS CUSTOMER BY HIS FIRST NAME, LIKE YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP, SOMETHING BEYOND THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP. IS THAT TRUE? WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ROB? >> HE WAS MY CUSTOMER FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND WE HAD A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND HE WOULD COME IN AND PICK OUT DIFFERENT VASES AND DIFFERENT CONTAINERS THAT WERE USUALLY A LITTLE WEIRD AND HE'D SAY THIS IS THE EVENT I WANT TO CELEBRATE AND DO YOUR THING. THAT WAS AWESOME TO ME BECAUSE I GOT TO DO SOMETHING CREATIVE AND OUT-OF-THE-BOX AND SOMETHING HE'D LIKE. IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO DO THAT FOR HIM BUT AGAIN, I COULDN'T DO HIS WEDDING. >> HERE WE HAVE A STORY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS WAS A CUSTOMER SHE HAD A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES, HE ASKED HER THE ONE THING SHE COULD NOT PROVIDE, WHICH WAS TO VIOLATE OR CONS -- THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE STORY. WE WENT RIGHT OUT OF THERE AND REPORTED HERE, LIKE IN A NOVEL. SO MUCH FOR THAT RELATIONSHIP. >> I WANT YOU TO SHARE, WITH THE AUDIENCE, WHAT YOU TOLD US LAST NIGHT IN A RECEPTION THAT WE HAD, GETTING EVERYBODY A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER AND GET READY FOR TONIGHT AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE INTERACTING WITH FELLOW BELIEVERS OR THE SUPPORT YOU DID NOT GET FROM PEOPLE? >> I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT I'M -- ON THE GOOD SIDE, THE SUPPORT WE'VE GOTTEN NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF EMAILS SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE SUPPORT YOU, WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU. ON THE DOWNSIDE, WE'VE ALSO GOTTEN A LOT OF HATE MAIL. WE'VE GOTTEN THREATS. WE'VE GOTTEN DEATH THREATS. >> NOTHING SAYS TOLERANCE LIKE DEATH TOLERANCE. NOTHING LIKE THAT WARM FUZZY. CAN YOU FEEL THAT EMANATING IN THE ROOM? >> LATELY -- WE'RE GOING ON THREE YEARS OF GOING THROUGH THIS -- WE'VE BEEN GETTING IN APPROPRIATE THINGS MAILED TO OUR P.O. BOX AND IT'S DISHEARTENING, YOU KNOW. >> DISHEARTENING IS WHEN PEOPLE SAY, I SUPPORT YOU, BUT... I KNOW YOU SAID LAST NIGHT, YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS, TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE SAID, I'M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU MY BUSINESS BUT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW I'M DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU. TELL US ABOUT THAT. >> PEOPLE WOULD COME IN AND SAY, WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS, WE'RE SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE STANDING UP FOR YOUR FAITH. WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOU AND THEN I'D GO TO PUT MY STICKER ON THE BOX. IT WAS A BOX STICKER WITH PINK WRITING AND THEY'D ASK ME TO NOT PUT THAT ON THE BOX. [CRYING] SO I SAT THERE AND I THOUGHT, IF YOU'RE WITH ME AND YOU'RE STANDING WITH ME, WHY CAN'T YOU STAND, YOURSELF, AND THAT'S -- [APPLAUSE] >> THAT, TO ME, MIGHT BE THE MOST DISAPPOINTING THING WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THIS CONVERSATION. I'D HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE OPEN ABOUT IT. WE DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING. ABOUT A WEEK AGO, I INTERVIEWED CRAIG JAMES, THE FORMER SPORTS CASTER, WHO LOST HIS JOB BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID WITH SENATOR CRUZ. HE WORKED FOR 20 YEARS DOING COLLEGE BROADCASTING ALL OVER THE COUNTRIES AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM, TRAVELED WITH HIM. BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID, SOMEHOW, THAT DISQUALIFIED HIM FROM BEING IN SPORTS. NO ONE HAS SAID, I KNOW CRAIG JAMES, HE'S NOT A HATER, HE'S NOT A BIGOT, I'VE SPENT TIME WITH HIM. HE SAID TO ME, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS PRIVATELY, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SENT ME PRIVATE NOTES. THEY'RE ALL AFRAID THAT IF THEY SPEAK UP PUBLICLY, THEY'LL LOSE THEIR JOBS. AT SOME POINT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION, WHOM DO WE FEAR MORE, THE ONE WHO CAN DESTROY THE JOB OR DESTROY THE BODY AND CAST IT TO HELL? WHOM DO WE FEAR? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'VE READ AND SEEN NUMEROUS INTERVIEWS WITH YOU. [LAUGHTER] YOU'RE LIKE BRING IT ON, IT'S ON LIKE DONKEY KONG. MY WIFE SAYS THAT'S ALWAYS HARDER ON HER, WATCHING IT HAPPEN TO ME. I VIEW IT AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. IN YOUR CASE, WATCHING THIS HAPPEN AND WATCHING YOUR WIFE AND HER LIFE DREAM, HER BUSINESS, WATCHING THIS HAPPEN TO HER, HOW DID IT IMPACT YOU? >> IT'S SOMETHING YOU NEVER WANT TO SEE HAPPEN. TO WATCH NOT ONLY SOMETHING SHE WORKED SO HARD ON, BUT SOMETHING WE WENT IN TOGETHER, TO BUILD THIS BUSINESS UP AND WATCH IT BE TAKEN AWAY BY THE VERY GOVERNMENT THAT WAS INTENDED TO PROTECT YOUR FREEDOM. WATCHING IT BE DESTROYED BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TOLERANCE WHATSOEVER. I WAS NEVER IN A COURT. I HAVE YET TO BE IN A COURT. THIS WAS A BUREAUCRATIC ENTITY THAT WAS BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP TO DO THE VERY THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO US. IT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE CONSTITUTION. IT IS SOMETHING THAT DICTATES A LOT OF THE GOVERNMENT AS IT SITS RIGHT NOW. WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN A ROOM FILLED WITH BUREAUCRATS THAT DON'T RECOGNIZE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS FROM THE BEGINNING. BIASES ARE THE NORM AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING AND WE NEED TO ALL TAKE A STAND. [APPLAUSE] >> I WANT TO BRING YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU'RE THE PERSON ON THIS PANEL WHO WAS WON. YOU HAVE FOUGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOMS AND YOU HAVE WON, PENDING AN APPEAL. MAKE SURE I GET THIS QUOTE CORRECT, THE JUDGE IN YOUR CASE, SAID, QUOTE, TO PRINT SHIRTS WAS BASED ON NOT THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF THE MEMBERS, UNQUOTE. TELL THE AUDIENCE WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHY IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN YOUR VICTORY? >> WE'LL PRINT FOR ANYBODY. IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM WAS OR WHO THEY WERE. IT WAS THE MESSAGE. IF SOMEONE PRESENTS A MESSAGE TO ME, THAT CONFLICTS MY BELIEFS AND CONTRADICATES MY BELIEFS, THAT'S THE LINE. THE JUDGE LOOKED AT THE HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY AND WE HAVE REJECTED MESSAGES FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT JUST ONE SPECIFIC GROUP. WE ALSO HAD SHOWN THAT WE WORKED WITH HOMOSEXUALS. HE COULD SEE IT WAS ABOUT THE MESSAGE. IT WASN'T ABOUT WHO CAME IN THE DOOR. THAT WAS THE POINT ALL ALONG IS HEY, I'LL WORK WITH EVERYBODY BUT NOT EVERY MESSAGE I COULD PRINT. >> HE REALLY UNLOCKED THE ROSETTA STONE TO WINNING THIS ARGUMENT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT DISCRIMINATION. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE, ANYONE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY MAY BE DOING IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES, CAN WALK INTO YOUR PLACE OF BUSINESS OR YOUR HOME AND DEMAND THAT YOU DO THINGS WITH IT THAT VIOLATES YOUR CONSANCE. WOULD WE TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO PRINT HATEFUL THINGS FROM WESTBORO BAPTIST CHURCH, WOULD ANYBODY SIDE THAT THAT IS RIGHT? EVEN THOUGH WE MAY DISAGREE, WE WOULD SIDE WITH HIM BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. AMEN? [APPLAUSE] WOULD WE TELL A BLACK MAN THAT HE HAS TO PROVIDE THE FOOD AND DRINK FOR A WHITE SUPREMACY WEDDING, COULD HE SAY NO? YOU KNOW, WHAT'S IRONIC ABOUT IT, WHEN THERE WAS A CROWD CAMPAIGN, IT WAS CANCELED BECAUSE IT VIOLATED THE TERMS OF SERVICE OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT HOSTED THE CAMPAIGN. IS THAT NOT IRONIC. I WANT TO BRING IN SERGEANT MONK BECAUSE YOU HAVE A UNIQUE CALLING IN THIS CONVERSATION, PHILLIP, IN THAT YOU TOOK AN OATH. YOU ARE WILLING TO LAY DOWN YOUR LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH YOU. FOR PEOPLE WHOSE VALUES YOU MAY NOT SHARE, YOU ARE WILLING TO DO THAT AS A SOLDIER. CAN YOU TELL THE AUDIENCE WHAT YOUR STORY IS AND HOW IT IMPACTS AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE MILITARY. PHILLIP, WE'RE GOING TO TELL THOSE OF YOU, IN UNIFORM, THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THE VERY FREEDOMS YOU'RE WILLING TO LAY YOUR LIFE DOWN FOR? >> I'LL SAY RIGHT FROM THE START, YOU CALLED ME TODAY AND I WILL DROP EVERYTHING AND I WILL GO ANYWHERE THIS COUNTRY NEEDS ME AND I WILL PUT MY LIFE DOWN FOR YOU, WHETHER YOU'RE GAY, STRAIGHT, YOUNG OR OLD. WE WILL DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] I'M JUST SAYING. [APPLAUSE] BUT I WILL TELL YOU, IN THE MILITARY RIGHT NOW, YOU CANNOT SPEAK BIBLICAL TRUTH ABOUT MARRIAGE. I COME BACK FROM A DEPLOYMENT TO AN OPEN LESBIAN COMMANDER COMMANDER AND SHE BACKS ME INTO A CORNER AND WANTS TO KNOW MY VIEWS ON MARRIAGE. I'LL TELL YOU THIS, WHEN I'M BACKED INTO A CORNER BETWEEN A MAJOR AND A MAKER, I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. AMEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BETWEEN A COMMANDER OR MY CREATOR, I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN I WAS DEPLOYED TO IRAQ, THERE WERE 600 OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN THAT WERE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES OVER THERE AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS OVER THERE THINKING THAT THEY ARE PRESERVING THE FREEDOMS RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA AND THE MOST HEARTBREAKING I HAD WITH ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT RETURNED WAS THAT, HE FELT LIKE, IN THE TEN YEARS -- TEN-PLUS YEARS WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING OVERSEAS, THE REAL WAR FOR AMERICA WAS HAPPENING RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] >> WE'VE GOT JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEFT, I WANT TO GO AROUND, RAPID FIRE. FINAL WORD OF ENCOURAGE AND/OR CHALLENGE FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE AND WATCHING AROUND THE COUNTRY. MELISSA, GO FIRST. >> OH, GOSH. I GUESS, YOU KNOW, FOR ME, TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT BEFORE ALL OF THIS HAPPENED, I HAD A VERY LARGE LACK OF TRUST IN MY GOD AND I HATE TO ADMIT THAT, BUT I DID AND THROUGH THIS AND THROUGH STANDING FOR HIM, I LEARNED TO TRUST HIM SO MUCH AND I'VE SEEN -- [APPLAUSE] I'VE SEEN GOD IN MY LIFE MORE THAN I'VE EVER SEEN HIM IN MY LIFE. STAND FOR GOD AND BE STRONG BECAUSE YOU WILL SEE HIM MOVE IN YOUR LIFE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE. >> I LEARNED THREE LESSONS GOING THROUGH WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH. I BELIEVE ALL OF US AS BELIEVERS SHOULD TAKE NOTE. GOD ALWAYS PREPARES HIS CHILDREN FOR SUFFERING. THAT'S LESSON NUMBER ONE. LESSON NUMBER TWO, THERE ARE WORLDLY CONSEQUENCES FOR STANDING FOR CLEIST AND FOR STANDING FOR BIBLICAL TRUTH. THAT'S LESSON NUMBER TWO. LESSON NUMBER THREE IS THERE ARE ALSO KINGDOM CONSEQUENCES FOR STANDING FOR CHRIST AND STANDING FOR BIBLICAL TRUTH, AND THE KINGDOM CONSEQUENCES ARE ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE WORLDLY CONSEQUENCES. [APPLAUSE] AMERICANS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN LIVING OUT THEIR FAITH AND KEEPING THEIR JOBS. IF YOU EVER ARE FACED WITH THE CHOICE OF LIVING OUT YOUR FAITH OR KEEPING YOUR JOB, LIVING OUT YOUR FAITH IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT CHOICE. >> SERGEANT? >> IF YOU ARE A SERVICEMAN OR WOMAN OUT THERE SOISK AND YOU FACE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'VE GOT A THREE FOLD AVENUE. THE VERY FIRST THING I TELL YOU IS DROP TO YOUR KNEES AND PRAY TO THE GREAT I AM THAT HE WILL SEE YOU THROUGH. TWO, CALL IN REINFORCEMENTS. GET ON THE PHONE AND DIAL THEIR EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD, THEY'RE MILITARY EXPERTS WHO WILL JOIN UP WITH YOU. THEN I WILL TELL YOU GET OFF YOUR KNEES AND STAND UP AND FIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIGHT BACK YOU WIN. >> I WANT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE YOUTH OR THE KIDS IN THIS ROOM. I WANT YOU GUYS TO REALLY LISTEN TO THE STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD TONIGHT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE IS A COST AS I MENTIONED IN THAT VIDEO WITH MY KIDS, THE REALITY IS IF I SIGN UP TO FOLLOW CHRIST THERE IS A GENUINE COST IN SOISK HIM. NUMBER TWO, DON'T EVER SUBSTITUTE LOVE FOR TRUTH. THEY HAVE TO GO TOGETHER. LOVE AND TRUTH GO TOGETHER. SO SPEAK TRUTH IN LOVE AND DON'T GIVE UP ON THAT. [APPLAUSE] >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT'S HEROES. GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU, GUYS. >> THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF THIS CAMPAIGN. IT IS OUR FIRST FREEDOM. ALL OF OUR OTHER FREEDOMS DERIVE FROM THIS. WE CAN'T HAVE GOD GIVEN RIGHTS IF WE CAN'T HAVE OUR GOD. THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS AUDIENCE WHO AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOFFED AND TWO OF OUR THREE BRANCHES HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT HE WILL FIGHT FOR THESE RIGHTS. HE'S DONE IT IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, AND HE'S WON NUMEROUS CASES THAT HAVE HELPED KEEP OUR RIGHTS SECURED IN THIS REPUBLIC. AND NOW HE IS DOING IT IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THE KEY THING AND THE REASON WHY I AM SUPPORTING THIS GENTLEMAN, THE NUMBER ONE REASON, BECAUSE THIS IS A FINE FIELD AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE SENATOR HAS BEEN VERY GRACIOUS TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENTERED THIS RACE, IT'S A DEEP FIELD. THERE ARE GOOD CANDIDATES WHO MORALLY WOULD BE MORE THAN QUALIFIED TO BE UP ON THIS STAGE HERE TODAY. THERE IS ONEHING T THINK THAT SETS SENATOR CRUZ APART FROM EVERYONE ELSE. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN RIGHT VS. LEFT, IT IS RIGHT VS. WRONG. AHN THAT SOMETIMES TO PRESERVE AND DEFEND THOSE GOD GIVEN RIGHTS, TO HONOR THAT OATH OF OFFICE, TO PRESERVE AND DEFEND AND PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST ALL ENEMIES BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MEANS SOMETIMES THOSE DOMESTIC ENEMIES ARE WEARING YOUR JERSEY. SOMETIMES THEY'RE ON YOUR OWN TEAM. ULTIMATELY IT IS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ANY POLITICAL PARTY NOT ANY IDEOLOGY AND THAT ULTIMATELY WHEN YOU TAKE THAT OATH OF OFFICE IT IS SO HELP ME GOD, NOT THE MEDIA. NOT THE TICK CALL PARTY. NOT THE POLLS. BUT SO HELP ME GOD. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN THESE NEXT FIVE MONTHS TO SEE THAT HE HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO FIGHT IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT HE HAS SHOWN BOTH IN THE JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES IN THE U.S. SENATE AND BEFORE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. AND LET'S MAKE HIM THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SENATOR TED TRUZZ. SENATOR TED CRUZ. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music) HALLELUJAH (music) >> PRAISE GOD. >> YOU DID GOOD. >> WHAT INCREDIBLE, POWERFUL, MOVING TESTIMONY. IT IS MY HOPE THAT EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN IOWA AND THAT EVERY MAN AND WOMAN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY LISTENS TO THOSE STORIES. LISTEN TO THOSE STORIES, UNDERSTAND THESE THREATS ARE NOT IMAGINED. THEY'RE NOT MADE UP. THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE LEADING REAL LIVES WHO FOUND THEMSELVES FACING PERSECUTION. SIMPLY FOR LIVING OUT THEIR FAITH. THERE IS A WAR ON FAITH IN AMERICA TODAY. IN OUR LIFETIME, DID WE EVER IMAGINE THAT IN THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE, WE WOULD BE WITNESSING OUR GOVERNMENT PERSECUTE ITS CITIZENS FOR THEIR FAITH? WE ARE BLESSED TODAY TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF HEROES WHO SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE TO ALL OF US OF WHAT IT MEANS TO SACRIFICE FOR THE KINGDOM. HEROES WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR LIVING OUT THEIR FAITH AND THEIR PERSONAL CONVICTION. THEIR STORIES ARE REAL AND THEY'RE PERSONAL. RIGHT HERE IN IOWA, BETTY AND DICK FORCED TO CLOSE DOWN THEIR WEDDING CHAPEL BECAUSE OF THEIR BELIEFS IN THE SCRIPTURAL TEACHINGS OF MARRIAGE. AND IN WASHINGTON, A WOMAN FACED THE SAME CONSEQUENCE FOR HER COURAGE AFTER SHE AND HER FLOWER SHOP HAD BEEN SUED. KAREN AND MELISSA KLAIN, THEIR BAKERY IN OREGON AND BLADE ADAMS' T-SHIRT BUSINESS IN KENTUCKY. ATLANTA FIRE CHIEF CALVIN COCHRAN, WHAT A VISION FOR GOD. AND SENIOR MASTER SERGEANT PHILIP MONK, WHO BOTH AFTER LAFF TIMES OF SERVICE WERE FORCED TO DEPART THEIR STATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH. AS AARON KLEIN HAS SAID SO POWERFULLY, MY FIGHT IN THIS SITUATION IS RELIGIOUS FREED. IT IS THE ABILITY TO LIVE AND WORK BY THE DICTATES OF MY FAITH WITHOUT BEING PUNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL AMERICANS. SHOULD BE FREE TO DO THAT. THINK OF THE STORIES ON THIS STAGE. THESE ARE PEOPLE FOR WHOM RIGHT AND TRUTH WILL ALWAYS MEAN MORE THAN GOING ALONG TO GET ALONG OR LOOKING THE OTHER WAY WHEN RIGHT IS REPLACED WITH WHAT IS WRONG. THESE HEROES HAVE BOLDLY RESISTED THE STATE ENCROACHING ON THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THEY HAVE FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE WASHINGTON ELITES' WAR ON FAITH. AS HAVE OTHER HEROES ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIKE THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR WHO HAVE STOOD FOR FAITH ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS LITIGATING AGAINST THIS CATHOLIC CHARITY TO FORCE NUNS TO PAY FOR ABORTION INDUCING DRUGS IN OTHERS. IS IT ANY SURPRISE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE TODAY WOULD USE OBAMA CARE TO ASSAULT PEOPLE OF FAITH AND TO TRY TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS? WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES, DON'T WE NEED TO KNOW THE FULL TRUTH BEHIND THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO COME UP WITH STATUTES AND REGULATIONS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST AND PERSECUTING PEOPLE OF FAITH? DON'T WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS, WHAT E-MAILS WERE SENT, WHAT OUTSIDE GROUPS WERE INVOLVED IN MAKING THE DECISION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW AN ENEMY OF THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY RIGHTS OF OUR CITIZENS? WE ARE SEEING TODAY AN UNPRECEDENTED ASSAULT ON FREEDOM, ON FAITH, AND ESPECIALLY ON LIFE AND MARRIAGE. I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ANYONE HERE OF THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED EACH AND EVERY DAY BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THESE VIDEOS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC. MAKE VIVID WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW. THAT THOSE WHO SUPPORT THEM HAVE NONE STRAITD AN UTTER DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE. INNOCENT LIVES SHOULD NOT BE UP FOR DEBATE. INNOCENT LIFE SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS A BUSINESS TRANSACTION. [APPLAUSE] SELLING THE BODY PARTS OF UNBORN CHILDREN IS A FEDERAL CRIME THAT CARRIES WITH IT 10 YEARS IN PRISON. AND IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT I WILL INSTRUCT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION INTO PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND PROSECUTE ANY CRIMINAL ACTION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LIFE IS A PRECIOUS GIFT FROM GOD. AS THOMAS JEFFERSON PROCLAIMED, THE GOD WHO GAVE US LIFE. ONCE THE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT TO LIFE, IT CAN TAKE AWAY ANYTHING, EVEN MARRIAGE. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, -- I APPRECIATE YOU EXPRESSING YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS -- [CHEERING] -- BUT THE RULE OF LAW -- [CHEERING] [CHANTING] U.S.A.! >> I APPRECIATE INDIVIDUALS --. WE'LL HAPPILY ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. TONIGHT WE'RE FOCUSING ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] AND JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WE LIVED THROUGH THE MOST TRAGIC SUPREME COURT DECISION SINCE ROE VS. WADE. FIVE BLACK ROBED LAWYERS ATTEMPTED TO REDEFINE MARRIAGE FOR ALL 50 STATES. JUSTICE SCALIA WROTE IN HIS DISSENT, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS DESCENDED FROM THE DISCIPLINED LEGAL REASONING OF JOHN MARSHALL AND JOSEPH STOREY TO THE MYSTICAL APARISM OF THE FORTUNE COOKIE. THE FORTUNE COOKIE RULES AND THE MORAL TRUTH THAT HAS BEEN EVIDENT TO EVERY CIVILIZATION IN RECORDED HISTORY HAS BECOME DECLARED OBSOLETE. DURING THE ORAL ARGUMENTS, WE WITNESSED A FRIGHTENING ALTHOUGH CLARIFYING EXCHANGE. JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO ASKED THE UNITED STATES SOLICITOR GENERAL WHETHER A UNIVERSITY'S TAX-EXEMPT STATUS COULD BE REVOKED, ""IF IT OPPOSED SAME SEX MARRIAGE."" THE SOLICITOR GENERAL'S RESPONSE WAS NOT REASSURING. ""I DON'T DENY THAT, JUSTICE ALITO. IT IS -- IT IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE. THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITIES, OF CHRISTIAN GRADE SCHOOLS, CHRISTIAN CHARITIES, EVEN OF THE CHURCH, ITSELF, IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RULING DENIES THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE AS A UNION OF ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN COULD EASILY BE USED AS A PRETEXT TO PROSECUTE AND PERSECUTE ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN THE SCRIPTURAL TEACHING AND BIBLICAL UNDERSTANDING OF MARRIAGE. [APPLAUSE] YOU LISTEN TO THESE INCREDIBLE, BRAVE STORIES, AND YOU WONDER, IS THE NEXT VICTIM OF PERSECUTION YOUR PASTOR STANDING AT THE PULPIT ON SUNDAY MORNING. IS IT THE GRADE SCHOOL THAT YOUR LITTLE GIRLS GO TO? IS IT THE CHARITY WHERE YOU VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME AT A CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTER? WE HAVE DESCENDED FROM AN ATTACK ON LIFE TO MARRIAGE AND NOW FROM MARRIAGE TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THESE ADVOCATES TO TEAR DOWN MARRIAGE. NOW THE WASHINGTON ELITE WANT TO SILENCE THOSE WHO BLEAMB IN THE BIBLICAL DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE. THEIR GOAL IS TO KEEP PEOPLE OF FAITH FROM BEING ABLE TO LIVE BY THE DICTATES OF THEIR CONSCIENCE AND TO FREELY EXPRESS THEIR BLEAF. THE TACTIC WE HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS TO BULLY PEOPLE OF FAITH INTO SILENCE. HOW MANY OF THESE HEROES TOLD STORIES OF PEOPLE SAYING, I'M WITH YOU BUT ONLY IN SECRET? BECAUSE I CANNOT STAND THE CONDEMNATION THAT COMES IF I STAND WITH YOU IN THE LIGHT OF DAY. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. IT CUTS ACROSS CLASS LINES, RACIAL LINES, ETHNIC LINES, PARTY LINES. IT UNIFIES US. IT IS WHO WE ARE AS AN AMERICAN PEOPLE. I'M REMINDED OF A LINE FROM THE MOVIE ""THE USUAL SUSPECTS."" THE GREATEST TRICK THE DEVIL EVER PLAYED WAS TO CONVINCE THE WORLD HE DIDN'T EXIST. I WILL SUGGEST A COROLLARY. THE GREATEST TRICK THE LEFT HAS EVER PLAYED IS TO CONVINCE CONSERVATIVES THAT AMERICANS DON'T SHARE OUR VALUES. [APPLAUSE] AMERICA IS AND REMAINS A CENTER RIGHT COUNTRY. WE ARE AND REMAIN A COUNTRY BUILT ON JUDEO CHRISTIAN VALUES. THAT IS WHO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WE HERE TODAY MUST RENEW OUR RESOLVE TO PROTECT OUR GOD GIVEN RIGHTS FROM ALL OF THOSE EAGER TO TRY TO TAKE THEM AWAY. WE GATHER TODAY HERE IN THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY AND INTOLERANCE. AND FOR THOSE BRAVE HEROES WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND THEIR POSITIONS OF HONOR BY STANDING FOR FAITH. THIS RALLY IS A CHANCE TO STAND FOR FREEDOM AND FOR THE IDEA THAT RIGHTS DON'T COME FROM BLACK ROBED LAWYERS OR FROM POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON. THEY COME FROM GOD. [APPLAUSE] IT IS THIS UNDERSTANDING, THIS REVELATION THAT HAS MADE AMERICA AN EXCEPTIONAL NATION AND INDEED THE EXCEPTIONAL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] NOW IS THE TIME FOR EACH OF US TO ASK FOR THE COURAGE OF DANIEL AND ESTHER AND JEREMIAH. THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE OF FAITH VS. THOSE WHO WANT TO SILENCE OUR FAITH TO TAKE AWAY OUR FREEDOM. HISTORY SHOWS US THAT IN ORDER TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE PEOPLE, YOU MUST FIRST DESTROY THEIR MORAL FIBER, DESTROY THEIR FAITH. BUT WHAT SCARES THE EXTREMISTS IS MOST IS THAT THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN THERE ARE OF THEM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE HEARD TONIGHT OF TWO TREMENDOUS GROUPS. THE LIBERTY INSTITUTE AND THE ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM. TWO GROUPS I HAVE BEEN PROUD TO VOLUNTEER TO WORK WITH TO SUPPORT FOR MANY, MANY DECADES. LET ME TELL YOU, THESE GROUPS, IF YOU ARE FINDING YOURSELF PERSECUTED FOR YOUR FAITH, THESE GROUPS EXIST TO DEFEND OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. THEY HAVE LAWYERS ON CALL THAT WILL COME OFTEN AND REPRESENT YOU FOR FREE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE AND UNDERSTAND IF WE LOSE OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WE LOSE EVERY FREEDOM IN AMERICA. MANY OF YOU KNOW MY FATHER IS A PASTOR. [APPLAUSE] HE SAW FREEDOM TAKEN AWAY IN CUBA. AND IT BREAKS HIS HEART TO SEE THE SAME THING HAPPENING IN AMERICA. MY FATHER TRAVELS AROUND THE COUNTRY, 76 YEARS OLD, AND HE IS ON THE ROAD SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WITH THE ENERGY OF A TEENAGER. AND HE DELIVERS A TOUGH MESSAGE ESPECIALLY TO FELLOW PASTORS. HE STANDS AND ADDRESSES PASTORS AND TELLS THEM, IF YOU LOOK AT THE PLIGHT OF THE NATION, NO ONE BEARS MORE RESPONSIBILITY THAN THE PASTORS. IF THE FLOCK STUMBLES IN A DITCH, YOU DON'T BLAME THE SHEEP. YOU BLAME THE SHEPHERDS. IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ROUGHLY 90 MILLION EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. IN THE LAST ELECTION 54 MILLION EVANGELICALS STAYED OUT. 54 MILLION. YOU WONDER WHY WE HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT COMES AFTER OUR FREE SPEECH RIGHTS, THAT COMES AFTER OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, THAT COMES AFTER MARRIAGE, THAT COMES AFTER OUR VALUES. IT IS BECAUSE 54 MILLION EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS STAYED HOME. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, WE WILL STAY HOME NO LONGER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'D LIKE TO ASK EVERY PASTOR WHO IS HERE WITH US TODAY TO PLEASE STAND. THEANING YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU FOR STANDING FOR FAITH. THANK YOU FOR THE IMPACT YOU'RE MAKING IN YOUR CONGREGATION AND YOUR COMMUNITY, STANDING UP TOGETHER, HELPING ALL OF US AWAKEN THE BODY OF CHRIST TO RESTORE THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE BUILDING AN ALLIANCE OF PASTORS WITH A PASTOR AND FAITH LEADER IN EACH OF THE 99 COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF IOWA. TOGETHER, WE WILL STAND UP AND WE WILL SHOW UP. WE ARE A SELF-GOVERNING PEOPLE AND WE WILL DEFEND OUR LIBERTY. WE WILL NOT BE SHUT OUT BECAUSE WE STILL HOLD TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE WILL NOT BE SILENT. WE WILL NOT TAKE COURT RULINGS AS A MANDATE TO FORGET OUR FAITH WHILE WASHINGTON ELITES TRY TO FORCE THEIR VALUES UPON US. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY I AM SO INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE COME OUT TODAY FOR THE HOME GROUPS AND CHURCH GROUPS ACROSS IOWA AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. IT GIVES ALL OF US HOPE THAT WHAT HAS BEEN LOST IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL IS ALIVE IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE. [APPLAUSE] AND I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN WORD, IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, ON MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, I WILL INSTRUCT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE I.R.S. AND EVERY FEDERAL AGENCY IN WASHINGTON THAT THE PERSECUTION OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ENDS TODAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LIKE THE SONG, ""GOD'S NOT DEAD."" WHICH WE'LL BE HEARING VERY SOON. NEITHER IS AMERICA. AND HER LOVE OF FREEDOM AND OUR PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOM. A NATION WILLING TO SUBJECT ITSELF TO THE TIERNEY OF MAN'S STANDARD IS NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED A FREE NATION. AND TO SHOW ALL OF US WHERE THIS CAN GO, WE'VE SEEN THE PERSECUTION HERE AT HOME. WE'VE SEEN SERGEANT MONK'S POWERFUL TESTIMONY OF OUR SOLDIERS FIGHTING FOR US WHO SAID THE REAL BATTLE WAS AND AND YET IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING, THAT IT CAN STILL GET MUCH, MUCH WORSE. AS HORRIFIC AS THE PERSECUTION IS GROWING HERE AT HOME, CHRISTIANS ACROSS THE GLOBE ARE FACING IMPRISONMENT. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW IS RECOGNIZE ONE MORE HERO. ONE MORE HERO THAT I HAVE GROWN TO RESPECT AND ADMIRE. THE WIFE OF PASTOR SAID. [APPLAUSE] (music) WELCOME. I AM SO GLAD YOU CAN BE HERE WITH US. >> THANK YOU. SENATOR: WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL US ABOUT PASTOR SITE -- SAID. >> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN DES MOINES. HE IS A GREAT DAD. I WAS WATCHING YOU WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER. IT IS HEARTBREAKING. WE HAVE MISSED HIS EMBRACE FOR OVER THREE YEARS. HE WILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM HIS FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST. HE HAS BEEN TORTURED AND BEATEN. HE HAS BEEN IN PRISON FOR TWO YEARS NOW. HE HAS GONE FROM PRISON TO PRISON BECAUSE HE HAS NOT ONLY NOT DENIED HIS FAITH BUT HE HAS SHARED HIS FAITH WITH OTHER MEN IN PRISON WITH HIM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO, HE IS IN THE HANDS OF THE HARDLINERS AND THEY ARE ANGRY. THEY HAVE TOLD OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT HE HAS NOT LEARNED HIS LESSON. HE HAS NOT DENIED HIS FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST BUT HE TELLS OTHERS ABOUT IT AND THAT IS THE WAY HE SHOWS HIS LOVE. THAT IS THE WAY -- THAT IS HOW HE FOUND LIFE IN CHRIST. HE IS A PASSIONATE FOLLOWER OF CHRIST. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR CRUZ: MANY OF YOU HERE KNOW HIS STORY. HE IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. HE AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN, THEIR FAMILY RESIDES IN IDAHO. THE PASTOR TRAVELED TO IRAN. AND WAS SENTENCED TO EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON. FOR THE CRIME OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL. IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS THAT HE HAS BEEN LOCKED UP. IN AN IRANIAN PRISON. AS WE THINK ABOUT THE THREATS WE FACE HERE, IT IS A POWERFUL REMINDER OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN. TELL US ABOUT SAID AS A HUSBAND AND A FATHER. >> BEFORE HE WENT TO IRAN, HE WAS USUALLY BEST HE WOULD USUALLY OPEN HIS SUITCASE BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING ON AN ORPHANAGE. HE WOULD TELL THE KIDS TO BRING THEIR TOYS AND CLOSE -- CLOTHING SO THAT HE COULD TAKE IT TO THE ORPHANAGE. HE WOULD GET -- HE WOULD TELL THEM TO BRING THE THINGS THAT THEY REALLY LIKED. MY SON WAS FOUR THE LAST TIME THEY SAW HIM. THEY WOULD CRY AND BRING THEIR FAVORITE TOYS. I WOULD GET MAD THINKING -- WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO THE KIDS? HE WOULD SAY THAT YOU ALWAYS GIVE GOT YOUR BEST. [APPLAUSE] BEST YOU ALWAYS GIVE -- YOU ALWAYS GIVE GOD YOUR BEST. YOU ALWAYS IN STILL FAITH IN GOD. MY DAUGHTER WILL BE NINE NEXT MONTH AND SHE WAS FIVE. IT IS HEARTBREAKING THE A FEW WEEKS AGO, I NOTICED SHE STOPPED DRAWING SAID IN THE FAMILY PICTURES. IT IS A WAY OF SHOWING THAT SHE HAS GIVEN UP HOPE. SHE HAS OPENED FOR EVERY BIRTHDAY THAT THIS WOULD BE THE BIRTHDAY. I THINK IT HAS BECOME A COPING MECHANISM FOR THEM TO SAY THAT THIS IS LIFE WITH MOMMY AND THIS IS HOW IT IS GOING TO BE. I TELL THEM TO TRUST IN JESUS AND THAT WE SERVE A GOOD GOD. IF WE DO NOT -- IF THINGS DO NOT WORK OUT ON OUR TIMELINE, OURS IS NOT TO QUESTION. I FEEL LIKE MY FAITH WITH GOD -- WHEN I HIT ROCK BOTTOM, I DISCOVERED CHRIST IN A MORE INTIMATE WAY. I CAN NEVER QUESTION GOD'S GOODNESS. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR CRUZ: WHEN THE PASTOR WAS FIRST SENT TO PRISON, HE WAS SENT TO A BRUTAL PRISON IN IRAN. BUT IT TURNED OUT FOR THE AYATOLLAH, THAT IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THEY TRANSFERRED HIM TO AN EVEN WORSE PRISON. THIS IS WHERE THEY KEEP THEIR DEATH ROW. IT IS THE WORST HELL HOLE THE ENTIRE IRANIAN PRISON SYSTEM. THE DAY THAT THEY TRANSFERRED HIM, WAS THE DAY THAT THE IRANIAN AYATOLLAH CELEBRATES. IT IS A HOLIDAY IN IRAN. IT IS THE ANNIVERSARY OF IRAN TAKING AMERICAN CITIZENS HOSTAGES IN THE 1970'S. HE LEADS CHANCE -- DEATH TO AMERICA. THAT WAS THE DAY THAT THEY TRANSFERRED THE PASTOR TO THIS PRISON. HOW IS HIS HEALTH HOLDING UP? >> THEY DO NOT LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS AMERICA BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS JESUS CHRIST. THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT THE RADICALS WHO ARE HOLDING HIM DO NOT LIKE ABOUT HIM. HE IS NOT DOING VERY WELL. I WISH I COULD SAY HE WAS. HE IS IN ONE OF THE WORST PRISONS IN THE WORLD. THE BEATINGS HE ENDURED THE FIRST MONTH WERE PRETTY HORRIBLE. HE WAS PUT IN SOLITARY. HE HAS PUT IN AND OUT OF SOLITARY THREE OR FOUR TIMES. HE HAS NEVER BEEN TREATED. DOCTORS SAY HE NEEDS SURGERY. HE WAS HOSPITALIZED LAST YEAR BUT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO TREAT HIM. PART OF THEIR TORTURE IS TO ALLOW HIM TO SUFFER. SENATOR CRUZ: AND YET, IN THE FACE OF THIS DARKNESS, ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THINGS IS THAT FROM THAT IRANIAN PRISON CELL, PASTOR SAID HAS LED NUMEROUS OF HIS FELLOW PRISONERS AND HIS CAPTORS TO CHRIST. [APPLAUSE] WE KNOW THAT GOD HAS IT IN HIS POWER TO FREE SAID FROM PRISON. JUST AS PAUL AND SILAS -- AN EARTHQUAKE SHATTERED OPEN THEIR PRISON AND THEY WALKED OUT. WITH THEIR CAPTORS READY TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES. IN GOD'S POWER. NOTE THAT TODAY RIGHT NOW, SAID IS NOT ALONE IN THAT PRISON. AND YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN ARE NOT ALONE AS YOUR HUSBAND IS SUFFERING. EVERY ONE OF US HERE -- WE ARE LIFTING YOU UP IN PRAYER. WE ARE STANDING WITH YOU. [APPLAUSE] YOUR FAITH, YOUR STEADFASTNESS, YOUR COURAGE, AND YOUR LOVE -- THEY INSPIRE EVERYONE OF US. GOD'S LOVE SHINES FROM YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A VIDEO THAT THEIR CHILDREN MADE FOR THEIR FATHER. IF WE COULD PLAY THE VIDEO. >> DEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA. PLEASE HELP BRING OUR DADDY HOME. I MISS HIM SO MUCH. >> I WANT MY DADDY TO BE HOME FOR MY BIRTHDAY. >> I DON'T WANT TO MISS ANOTHER BIRTHDAY WITH HIM. >> I DON'T WANT HIM TO MISS ANOTHER BIRTHDAY OR CHRISTMAS OR FATHER'S DAY. >> PLEASE HELP BRING HIM HOME. >> WHY DOES OUR DADDY NEED TO BE IN PRISON FOR LOVING JESUS? [APPLAUSE] SENATOR CRUZ: PLEASE STAY WITH US FOR ONE MINUTE. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING VERY CLEARLY. PRESIDENT OBAMA -- BRING PASTOR SAID HOME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BEFORE WE WRAP UP AND WELCOME IN THE NEWSBOYS TO THE STAGE FOR THE CONCERT, I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE EACH OF THE HEROES TO COME BACK TO THE STAGE AND I WANT TO CLOSE THIS PORTION OF THE PROGRAM IN PRAYER. AS WE STAND TOGETHER, WE WELCOME EACH OF THE HEROES THAT CHANGED -- THAT SHARED YOUR STORY. LET ME SAY TO THE FOLKS AT HOME, TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING ON LIVE STREAM, TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING IN-HOME GROUPS OR CHURCH GROUPS -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE, SIGN OUR NATIONAL PETITION IN DEFENSE OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. IT IS AT THE WEBSITE. TEDCRUZ.ORG. OR YOU CAN TEXT THE WORD LIBERTY TO THE NUMBER 41444. TONIGHT, WE HAVE SEEN WITH THESE INCREDIBLE HEROES WHAT IT MEANS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH TO A WORLD THAT SOMETIMES REFUSES TO LISTEN TO THE TRUTH. WE HAVE SEEN WHAT IT MEANS TO SUFFER FOR IT BOTH HERE AT HOME AND ABROAD. ALL OF US MUST STAND FOR TRUTH. AND I WOULD ASK EACH OF US TO PRAY TOGETHER FOR THESE HEROES AND FOR OUR NATION. AND IF WE WOULD ALL STAND AND PRAY. FATHER GOD, WE COME TO YOU TODAY ON OUR KNEES. CELEBRATING YOUR GLORY, CELEBRATING THE COURAGE AND FAITH OF THESE HEROES WHO FOLLOW THE TEACHINGS OF THE WORD, WHO REFLECT IN THE COUNTENANCE, THE REDEEMING LOVE OF OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST. AND FATHER GOD, WE COME HERE TODAY CLAIMING THE PROMISES OF THE SCRIPTURE. JESUS TOLD US THAT HE HAS SENT ME TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, TO PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND. TO SET AT LIBERTY THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED, JESUS ALSO SAID, BUT WHOEVER DENIES ME BEFORE MEN, HIM I WILL ALSO DENY BEFORE MY FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN. IN GALATIANS FIVE:1 IT TELLS US TO STAND FAST IN THE LIBERTY BY WHICH CHRIST HAS MADE US FREE. AND DO NOT BE ENTANGLED AGAIN WITH THE YOGA OF BONDAGE. JESUS TOLD US -- BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO ARE PERSECUTED FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS SAKE, FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. WE CLAIM THAT PROMISE TONIGHT. FATHER GOD. GALATIANS 6:2 TELLS US TO BEAR ONE ANOTHER'S BURDENS AND SO FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST. THESE HEROES ARE NOT STANDING ALONE. THEY ARE STANDING SURROUNDED BY HEDGES OF PROTECTION WITH PRAYER WARRIORS AND INTERCESSORS IN THIS ROOM, ACROSS THE STATE, ACROSS THIS NATION, ACROSS THIS WORLD. THE BODY OF CHRIST IS STANDING TOGETHER. CELEBRATING THEIR KURDS AND PRAYING FOR PEACE. -- CELEBRATING THEIR CURRENT --COURAGE AND PRAYING FOR PEACE. FOR THE PEACE THAT SURPASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. FATHER GOD, WE CLAIM THE PROMISE OF PSALMS 35, THAT TELLS US WE -- WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR A NIGHT, BUT JOY COMETH IN THE MORNING. WE CLAIM THAT PROMISE TOGETHER. WE CELEBRATE. AND WE THANK YOU. FOR YOUR EVERLASTING LOVE. WE THANK YOU FOR THE PEER OF FINE, SANCTIFYING BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. AND WE THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT NATION IN WHICH WE LIVE. WITH THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY THAT EACH OF US IS GUARANTEED UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION AND WE PRAY THAT YOU WILL AWAKEN THE BODY OF CHRIST ACROSS THIS NATION. THE BELIEVERS AND LOVERS OF LIBERTY. THAT WE STAND TOGETHER. TO RECLAIM THIS NATION. WE THANK YOU AND WE PRAISE YOU. IN JESUS NAME WE PRAY. AMEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) >>",2015-11-07 18:06:18,2015-08-21,Des Moines,Iowa
http://www.c-span.org/video/?327669-1/senator-bernie-sanders-town-hall-meeting-south-carolina,Senator Bernie Sanders Town Hall Meeting in South Carolina,Bernie Sanders,"2, TELEVISION FOR SERIOUS READERS. >> BERNIE SANDERS SPOKE TO SUPPORTERS AT A RALLY IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, FOLLOWING HIS REMARKS, HE ALSO TOOK SOME QUESTIONS FROM VIEWERS. THIS IS JUST UNDER TWO HOURS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE LAST STOP OF THE EVENING. WE ARE EXCITED TO BE IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY FOR BERNIE 2016. I WILL BE YOUR MC FOR THIS EVENING. BEFORE I BRING OUT THE MAN OF THE HOUR, I WANT TO CHAT WITH YOU ALL. DID YOU KNOW, AMERICA CELEBRATED THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS MOMENT, LANDMARK LEGISLATION. AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. BUT THE SUPREME COURT 2013 DECISION GETTING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS A SHAMEFUL STEP BACKWARDS. IT WAS. TODAY WE KNOW OUR VOTING RIGHTS, FAMILY VALUES, THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND A BLACK LIVES ARE UNDER ATTACK. WE KNOW WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. WE NEED PEOPLE WE TRUST AT LEADING THIS COUNTRY TO GET THE WORK DONE. AM I RIGHT? WE NEED NEW VOICES THAT ARE NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT THE INJUSTICES PLAGUING PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE PLIGHT OF EVERYDAY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE CRITICAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW WHICH PROTECTED VOTERS IN PLACES WITH A HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION IS AS NECESSARY TODAY AS IT WAS DURING THE JIM CROW ERA. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY ARE PARALLEL ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY. PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO REFORMING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO WE ARE NOT LOCKING UP ALL GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE. BUT WE ARE INSTEAD ENDING THE DISGRACE THAT IS THE MASS INCARCERATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE WHO TRULY BELIEVE AND ARE WORKING TO ENSURE EVERY SINGLE YOUNG PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY RECEIVES A SHOT AT A QUALITY AFFORDABLE EDUCATION. PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE SANDERS. IF YOU BELIEVE LIKE I DO THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS THE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO. YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST VERY IMPORTANT STEP UP BY ATTENDING THIS TOWN HALL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [APPLAUSE] >> THIS PASSION YOU FEEL, THIS BURN, WE WANT YOU TO VISIT OUR WEBSITE. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. DONATE TO THE CAMPAIGN. THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO TO GET INVOLVED IS YOU CAN TEXT TO BERNIE TO 82623. THAT WILL GIVE YOU REAL TIME UPDATES. THE LAST THING YOU CAN DO IS FOLLOW US ON TWITTER. @BERNIESANDERS ON TWITTER. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SPREADING THIS MESSAGE, THIS MULTIRACIAL REVOLUTION, THIS FIGHT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE. ECONOMIC JUSTICE. RACIAL JUSTICE. ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] >> AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IT IS MY PLEASURE AND HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, UNITED STATES SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. [APPLAUSE] (music) [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THANK YOU. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE COULD SQUEEZE TOO MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. AND LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE OVERFLOW ROOM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT 3.5 MONTHS AGO. WHEN WE BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE WERE SAYING BERNIE SANDERS, INTERESTING GUY BUT KIND OF A FRINGE TYPE CANDIDATE. I MEAN NO ONE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY THE IDEA THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, WE NEED A POLITICAL REVOLUTION IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN ALMOST ALL OF THE NEW INCOME IS GOING TO THE TOP 1%. [APPLAUSE] MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY AND MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STARTED COMING OUT. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WE WERE ON THE WEST COAST AND WE HAD 15,000 PEOPLE IN SEATTLE. 28,000 PEOPLE IN PORTLAND, OREGON. AND WE HAD 27,000 PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES. IT SEEMS TO ME THE IDEAS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT FRINGE IDEAS, THEY ARE THE IDEAS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A CAMPAIGN ON THE MOVE. THIS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT IS GOING TO WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT THE ENTHUSIASM AND THE EXCITEMENT FOR THIS CAMPAIGN HASN'T JUST LAUNCHED TURNOUTS. PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES CONTROL OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. I DO NOT REPRESENT THE BILLIONAIRES' AGENDA. I DO NOT WANT THEIR MONEY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY SUPERPAC AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE ARE RAISING MONEY FOR THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM 400,000 AMERICANS. AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION, $31. I'M PROUD OF THAT. WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT IS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE DO NOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE DIVIDED, IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS BLACK AND WHITE AND HISPANIC, NATIVE AMERICAN, MEN AND WOMEN, STRAIGHT AND GAY, NATIVEBORN AND IMMIGRANT -- [APPLAUSE] IF WE STAND TOGETHER, THEY MAY HAVE ALL THE POWER. BUT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE. WHEN PEOPLE STAND TOGETHER, WE WIN. WHERE EVER I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY, MEDIA COME UP TO ME AND SAY, WE ARE SURPRISED, WHY IS THERE SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM? WHY ARE YOU MOVING UP IN THE POLLS? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT MY ANSWER IS TO THEM. MY ANSWER IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED WITH ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED WITH ESTABLISHMENT ECONOMICS. AND FRANKLY, THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA. [APPLAUSE] THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT CORPORATE GREED, THIS NEVER ENDING GREED OF NEEDING MORE AND MORE NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY HAVE, THAT CORPORATE GREED IS DESTROYING OUR ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND, AND I SPEAK HERE AS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE VETERANS COMMITTEE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT MEN AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND SOMETIMES LOST THEIR LIVES DEFENDING DEMOCRACY AND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN BILLIONAIRES ARE BUYING ELECTIONS. THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AT A TIME WHEN THIS COUNTRY FACES SO MANY ENORMOUS PROBLEMS, WHEN WE NEED SERIOUS DISCUSSION, THAT MUCH OF THE CORPORATE MEDIA WILL TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING WORKING AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN BE. THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS OR HILLARY CLINTON. IT IS NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, JEB BUSH OR ANYONE ELSE. IT IS ABOUT YOU, YOUR KIDS, YOUR PARENTS, AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] >> BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE. MR. SANDERS: AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RUN FOR OFFICE A NUMBER OF TIMES IN VERMONT, I HAVE NEVER RUN A NEGATIVE POLITICAL AD IN MY LIFE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WHAT POLITICS AND A DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT IS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY AND PROPOSE IDEAS AND LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DISCUSS THEM. I THINK IT IS ABSURD FOR POLITICIANS TO SAY, I AM GREAT, I AM WONDERFUL, EVERYONE ELSE IS TERRIBLE. THAT IS WRONG. WHAT WE NEED IS A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: OUR CAMPAIGN IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CAMPAIGNS, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE FACT THAT IT WE HAVE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE VISION, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN HOW WE ARE RUNNING THIS CAMPAIGN. I BELIEVE, AND LET ME BE HONEST WITH YOU AND TELL YOU WHAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WILL TELL YOU, THAT NO MATTER WHO IS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NO MATTER HOW GOOD HE OR SHE MAY BE, THAT PERSON CANNOT ADDRESS THE ENORMOUS PROBLEMS FACING WORKING FAMILIES AND THE MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF BIG MONEY INTERESTS IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE TRUTH AND IT IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH. WHAT I AM CALLING FOR IS NOT JUST YOUR SUPPORT TO ELECT TO ME AS PRESIDENT, I'M ASKING YOU TO BE PART OF A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. [APPLAUSE] A REVOLUTION WHICH TRANSFORMS OUR COUNTRY ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY, SOCIALLY, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS ABOUT IS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM COAST TO COAST, STANDING UP AND SAYING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THIS GREAT NATION AND OUR GOVERNMENT BELONG TO ALL OF US, NOT JUST TO A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS, THE SAD TRUTH, THE TRUTH IS OUR COUNTRY FACES MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND IF YOU THROW IN THE GLOBAL CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE PROBLEMS MAY BE WORSE TODAY. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS UNLESS WE ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY. I STARTED WITH THE ISSUE OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. TODAY, AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. MOST AMERICANS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, DON'T PERCEIVE THAT, DON'T FEEL THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BUSY WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS WHILE THE REST ARE GOING TO THE TOP 1%. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE TRUTH IS THE UNITED STATES TODAY HAS MORE INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION ON EARTH. THE INEQUALITY TODAY IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT IS WORSE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE 1928. SO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE GETTING RICHER AND RICHER. EVERYBODY ELSE IS BECOMING POORER AND POORER. THE TRUTH IS NO GREAT NATION CAN SURVIVE ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY WHEN SO FEW HAVE SO MUCH AND SO MANY HAVE SO LITTLE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG AND PROFOUNDLY IMMORAL. BY THE WAY, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE START INJECTING MORALITY INTO OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. NOT 1%, 1/10 OF 1% OWNS ALMOST AS MUCH[,] AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A PROLIFERATION OF MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES BUT ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. WE END UP WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN ONE FAMILY, ONE FAMILY, THIS IS AMERICA NOT PARAGUAY, NOT SOME SMALL THIRD WORLD COUNTRY, WHEN ONE FAMILY, THE WALTON FAMILY OF WALMART, OWNS MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 40% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. WHEN PEOPLE ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS, TRYING TO GET SOME INCOME AND HEALTH CARE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. WHEN THAT IS GOING ON, WELL, A HANDFULL OF BILLIONAIRES ARE MAKING OUT LIKE BANDITS. THIS IS A RIGGED ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: TOGETHER, YOU AND I AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES, NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. [APPLAUSE] THIS CAMPAIGN IS SENDING A SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD MESSAGE TO THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS. THAT IS YOU CANNOT, YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT ALL. [APPLAUSE] THE CEOS OF LARGE CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRE CLASS ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET HUGE TAX BREAKS WHEN CHILDREN IN AMERICA GO HUNGRY. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEND OUR JOBS TO CHINA AND OTHER LOW-WAGE COUNTRIES WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF WORK RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: CORPORATE AMERICA AND THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS ARE NOT GOING TO HIDE THEIR MANY BILLIONS IN PROFITS BY PUTTING THEM IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND OTHER TAX HAVENS. THEY ARE GOING TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. [APPLAUSE] WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT, THEIR GREED IS GOING TO END BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO END IT FOR THEM. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY, LET ME BRING IT ON HOME TO WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE WEALTHIEST 14 PEOPLE IN AMERICA, 14 PEOPLE, SAW THEIR WEALTH INCREASE BY $156 BILLION. HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHILE 14 PEOPLE SAW AN UNBELIEVABLE INCREASE IN THEIR WEALTH, 27% OF THE CHILDREN HERE ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. ALMOST 300,000 CHILDREN. 14 PEOPLE INCREASED WEALTH $156 BILLION. 27% OF THE KIDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA LIVING IN POVERTY. OF THOSE CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY, 138,000 ARE BLACK, 95,000 ARE WHITE AND 34,000 ARE HISPANIC. CHILDHOOD POVERTY IMPACTS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE REALITY. LET'S LAY IT ON THE TABLE. BILLIONAIRES BECOME RICHER WHILE CHILDREN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND ALL OVER AMERICA LACK ADEQUATE NUTRITION. IN THE YEAR 2015 IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IN VERMONT AND THROUGHOUT AMERICA, CHILDREN ARE GOING HUNGRY. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT BILLIONAIRES BECOME RICHER WHEN KIDS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE STARVING. [APPLAUSE] IF WE ARE A MORAL PEOPLE, WE GIVE THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. TO TURN OUR BACKS ON THE CHILDREN WHILE BILLIONAIRES GET RICHER IS NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BASIC NEEDS, LET US NOT FORGET THAT WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] NOW I LIVE IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT, AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE CANADIAN BORDER. THE CANADIANS GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO EVERY PEOPLE. IN THE U.K., THEY GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE. GERMANY, FRANCE, SCANDINAVIA DOES IT. EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY DOES IT ACCEPT US AND THAT IS WHY I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN A MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE IN SINGLE PAYMENT BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS BELIEVES IN, BUT THE CONGRESS DID PASS, AND THE PRESIDENT DID FIND, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. BY EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS NOW HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHO PREVIOUSLY LACKED IT. THAT IS A GOOD THING. [APPLAUSE] THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS CUT ARKANSAS' UNINSURED POPULATION ALMOST IN HALF. IT HAS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN KENTUCKY FROM 20% TO 12%. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IN SOUTH CAROLINA, OVER 200,000 PEOPLE WOULD GAIN HEALTH INSURANCE IF THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE EXPANSION. [APPLAUSE] NOT ONLY WOULD SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE GAIN HEALTH INSURANCE, THE STATE WOULD CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PICKS UP ALMOST ALL OF THE BILL. PRETTY GOOD DEAL. [APPLAUSE] IN MY VIEW, IT IS TERRIBLY WRONG TO ALLOW A RIGID, RIGHT-WING, POLITICAL IDEOLOGY TO STAND IN THE WAY OF HEALTH CARE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOUTH CAROLINIANS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WRONG TO ALLOW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL STATE TO DIE UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GO TO A DOCTOR WHEN THEY SHOULD. IT IS WRONG AND IMMORAL TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE WILL SUFFER AND BECOME MUCH SICKER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE MEDICAID. THAT IS WRONG. [APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD HOPE VERY MUCH THAT NOT ONLY HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES WOULD LET GO FOR ONE MINUTE OF THE RIGHT WING IDEOLOGY AND TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATE. [APPLAUSE] I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE LEGISLATURES AND GOVERNORS HATE PRESIDENT OBAMA. YOU CAN HATE PRESIDENT OBAMA, BUT DO NOT HATE THE KIDS AND THE WORKING FAMILIES IN YOUR STATE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT JUST THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME INEQUALITY. IT IS THE REALITIES THAT FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS OF OUR COUNTRY, ONCE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD, HAS BEEN DISAPPEARING. THE TRUTH IS WE ARE MUCH BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEFT OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] LET US NOT FORGET THAT WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE, WE WERE HEMORRHAGING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE AND WE WERE RUNNING UP A $1.4 TRILLION DEFICIT. I FIND IT INTERESTING REPUBLICANS COMPLAIN THEY ARE ONLY GROWING 250,000 JOBS A MONTH. THAT IS A LOT BETTER THAN LOSING 800,000 JOBS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: HERE IS THE POINT -- YES, WE ARE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TODAY ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. ALL OF YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION IN TECHNOLOGY MAKING WORKERS FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN THEY USED TO BE. AND YET, MANY OF THOSE WORKERS HAVE SEEN THEIR REAL WAGES GO DOWN. SINCE 1999, MEDIUM FAMILY INCOME TODAY IS ALMOST $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS IN 1999. THAT IS OUR REALITY. WE ARE BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE 6.5 YEARS AGO BUT WE CONTINUE TO FIND AND SEE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR MIDDLE-CLASS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS COME UP WITH PROPOSAL AFTER PROPOSAL THAT REBUILDS THE CRUMBLING MIDDLE-CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU. EVERY MONTH, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COMES OUT WITH THINGS. UNEMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA IS 5.3%. WRONG. THAT OFFICIAL STATISTIC DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR WORK AND THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING PART-TIME. ADD THAT ALTOGETHER, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS OVER 10%. THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE MUST DEAL WITH. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PUSH UNDER THE RUG. I ASKED THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE TO DO A STUDY ON YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IN THIS COUNTRY? IN TERMS OF KID TO HAVE NO JOBS, OR ARE WORKING PART-TIME WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME, WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THE KIDS 17 TO 20 WHO GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY WERE WHITE, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 33%. IF THEY WERE HISPANIC, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 36%. IF THEY WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 51%. [BOOING] WE ARE TURNING OUR BACKS ON AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAND ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. ONE OF THE GREAT SHAMES IN OUR COUNTRY, ONE OF THE GREAT INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT IS WE AS A NATION HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] CHINA, A NATION THREE TIMES LARGER THAN US, A COMMUNIST, AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRY HAS FEWER PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN WE DO. IF ANYBODY HERE THINKS THERE IS NOT A CONNECTION BETWEEN HUGE RATES OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND KIDS THAT END UP IN JAIL, YOU WOULD BE VERY MISTAKEN. RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, IN MY STATE, YOUR STATE, WE ARE 5.5 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL, WHO ARE NOT WORKING, WHO ARE HANGING OUT IN STREET CORNERS AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE. IN MY VIEW, IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE FOR US TO BE INVESTING IN EDUCATION AND IN JOBS. [APPLAUSE] IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO BE INVESTING IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAN IN JAILS AND INCARCERATION. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, IT IS NOT JUST INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY AND IT IS NOT JUST HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. IT IS THE SIMPLE FACT THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT MILLIONS OF OUR PEOPLE ARE WORKING AT WAGES THAT ARE TOO DAMN LOW. [APPLAUSE] THE CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF $7.25 AN HOUR, $7.25 AN HOUR -- [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: -- IS A STARVATION WAGE. OUR JOB IS TO RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO A LIVING WAGE -- $15 AN HOUR OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA TO SAY THAT IF SOMEBODY WORKS 40 HOURS A WEEK, THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE LIVING IN POVERTY. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS IN WAGES, I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM WILL STAND WITH THE WOMEN AND PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE TOO MANY WOMEN IN AMERICA TRYING TO BRING UP THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE MAKING $.78 ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO MEN. PAY EQUITY WILL TAKE A HUGE CHUNK OUT OF POVERTY IN AMERICA AND WE MUST FIGHT TO ESTABLISH PAY EQUITY. [APPLAUSE] I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES RUN AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. THEY JUST LOVE FAMILIES. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS WOMEN IN AMERICA SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES. I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IN THEIR CONCEPT OF FAMILY VALUES IS THAT WOMEN ARE TOO DUMB TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE CONTRACEPTIVE THEY NEED. I DISAGREE. WHAT THEY ARE ALSO SAYING IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF FAMILY VALUES IS THAT ARE GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED AND ENJOY ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] I AM VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE FOUR KIDS, SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN. JANE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 27 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE, WE BELIEVE IN FAMILY AND WE BELIEVE IN STRONGLY PROTECTING THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES, BUT MY FAMILY VALUES ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN REPUBLICAN FAMILY VALUES. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES, I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST END THE INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT OF BEING THE ONLY, ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE WORKERS PAID MEDICAL AND FAMILY LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN A WOMAN HAS A BABY TODAY, IF SHE HAS THE INCOME AND THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT, SHE CAN STAY HOME AND GET TO LOVE HER BABY, BOND WITH HER BABY. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE PARENTS, IT IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCES OF BEING HUMAN. [APPLAUSE] IT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT FOR THE BABY AS WELL. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS A FAMILY VALUE. IT IS A FAMILY VALUE WHEN MOM STAYS HOME, NOURISHES THE BABY, GETS TO KNOW HER BABY AND DAD IS THERE AS WELL. IT IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE TO TELL THAT MOM THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR BABY AND GO BACK TO WORK IN FIVE DAYS OR EIGHT DAYS. THAT IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE SUPPORTED AND WILL FIGHT FOR LEGISLATION THAT GUARANTEES EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY OR MEDICAL LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A FAMILY VALUE. IF EVERY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH COULD DO IT, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA COULD DO IT, TOO. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE REMAIN THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE SICK TIME TO OUR WORKERS OR PAID VACATION. THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE, TOO. [APPLAUSE] WITH REAL UNEMPLOYMENT OVER 10%, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT, WE NEED ON MAJOR FEDERAL JOBS PROGRAM TO PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] AT A TIME WHEN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING, OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR WATER SYSTEMS, WASTE WATER PLANTS, AIRPORTS, LEVIES, DAMS -- THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH WORK TO DO. A $1 TRILLION INVESTMENT OVER FIVE YEARS COULD CREATE OVER 13 MILLION DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- IT IS NOT ONLY THE ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE OF HAVING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, IT IS ALSO THE ABSOLUTE NEED TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF MORE JOBS BECAUSE OF OUR DISASTROUS TRADE POLICIES. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SENATOR AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE WHO VOTED AGAINST NAFTA, CAPFA, AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SENATOR WHO WILL HELP LEAD THE EFFORT AGAINST THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED, WE NEED TRADE POLICIES WHICH CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA, NOT IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WHEN WE USE WORDS LIKE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS AND ARROGANCE AND DISHONESTY, WE ONLY HAVE SOME OF THE ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE WALL STREET. ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT AS A RESULT OF THE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS OF WALL STREET, OUR ECONOMY WAS BROUGHT TO ITS KNEES, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS, THEIR HOUSES AND THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. TODAY, AFTER BAILING OUT WALL STREET BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BIG TO FAIL, THREE OUT OF THE FOUR LARGEST BANKS ARE BIGGER NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE WE BAILED THEM OUT. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: IN MY VIEW -- LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS -- WHEN YOU HAVE SIX BANKS ISSUING TWO THIRDS OF THE CREDIT CARDS IN THIS COUNTRY, 35% OF THE MORTGAGES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHEN YOU HAVE BANKS THAT ARE TOO BIG TO FAIL, THEY ARE TOO BIG TO EXIST. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED A FINANCIAL SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES AFFORDABLE LOANS TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN CREATE THE JOBS WE NEED. WE DO NOT NEED A FINANCIAL SYSTEM ON WALL STREET WHICH IS AN ISLAND UNTO ITSELF WHICH IS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT PROFITS FOR A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] I AM OFTEN ASKED, WELL, BERNIE, WHICH OF THE ISSUES OUT THERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER BECAUSE ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. HERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT IMPACTS EVERY OTHER ISSUE AND THAT IS FIVE YEARS AGO, AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE SUPREME COURT BY A 5-4 DECISION IN THE CITIZENS UNITED -- [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: IN THE CITIZENS UNITED CASE, WHAT THEY SAID TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, THEY SAID YOU GUYS ALREADY OWN MUCH OF THE ECONOMY. WE ARE NOW GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO OWN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE ONE FAMILY, THE EXTREME RIGHT WING KOCH BROTHERS. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: THE SECOND WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN AMERICA IS PREPARED TO SPEND $900 MILLION IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE. THAT IS MORE MONEY THAN EITHER PARTY WILL SPEND. WHEN YOU HAVE ONE FAMILY SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN EITHER OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. THAT IS OLIGARCHY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE NOT MADE MANY CAMPAIGN PROMISES, BUT THIS IS ONE I HAVE MADE AND WILL NOMINEE OF MINE TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WILL GET THAT POSITION UNLESS HE OR SHE IS LOUD AND CLEAR IN SAYING THAT ONE OF THEIR FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS WILL IN FACT BE RE-HEAR ING AND TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I AM A PASSIONATE BELIEVER IN DEMOCRACY. I REALLY BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. AND WHAT THAT MEANS, WHAT THAT VERY RADICAL IDEA MEANS -- ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YEARS OLD -- WHAT THAT IDEA MEANS IS THAT YOU AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, POOR PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE, ANYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE AND SHAPE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND NOT JUST A KING OR QUEEN OR A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. THAT IS A RADICAL IDEA THAT I BELIEVE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IN MY VIEW, NOT ONLY MUST WE OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED, WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER. I WANT TO SEE THIS COUNTRY HAVE THE MOST VIBRANT DEMOCRACY OF ANY COUNTRY ON EARTH. I WANT TO SEE US HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUTS, NOT ONE OF THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUTS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I WANT TO SEE A PROCESS IN WHICH ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM, ANYBODY IN AMERICA WHETHER YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE, PROGRESSIVE, MODERATE -- IF YOU BELIEVE YOU WANT TO GET INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR IDEAS, I WANT TO SEE YOU BE ABLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE WITHOUT BEGGING MONEY FROM THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN WASHINGTON, I WAS AT AN EVENT WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING, III AND PEOPLE WITH THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONGRESS. A VERY GOOD CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. AND WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THAT MEETING WAS TO, FIRST OF ALL, CELEBRATE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY -- AND SOMEONE MENTIONED THIS EARLIER. OF THE ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS ACT. OK? [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHAT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS ABOUT WAS TO SAY THE GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, MANY IN THE SOUTH, WILL SAY SORRY, ALL PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THAT WAS A GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR DEMOCRACY, BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO, THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED A VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST TO THE SOUTH, BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE, TO DENY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE, THOSE PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH THE POWERS THAT BE. AND THEY ARE UNSAFE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: YOU KNOW, I TAKE THAT KIND OF PERSONALLY AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. I HAVE RUN FOR OFFICE IN MY OWN STATE MANY TIMES. SOMETIMES I HAVE LOST. MOST TIMES I HAVE WON. BUT IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME, NEVER, NOT FOR ONE SECOND TO SAY THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT SYMPATHETIC TO ME, HOW DO I FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STOP THOSE PEOPLE FROM VOTING? IF YOU CANNOT RUN FOR OFFICE AND DEFEND YOUR IDEAS, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT RUN FOR OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: PEOPLE, LEGISLATURES, GOVERNORS WHO TRY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM VOTING BECAUSE THEY MAY VOTE AGAINST A GOVERNOR OR THE LEGISLATURES ARE NOTHING LESS THAN POLITICAL COWARDS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION WHICH MORE OR LESS SAYS THAT IF YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YOU ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, END OF DISCUSSION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN IS A VERY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AND IF OUR NATION IS GOING TO SUCCEED ECONOMICALLY, WE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WHAT SADDENS ME VERY MUCH IS AS WE SPEAK HERE TONIGHT, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT, YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY -- KIDS WHO HAVE DONE REALLY WELL IN SCHOOL. KIDS WERE QUALIFIED TO GET INTO COLLEGE, BUT THEY CANNOT GET INTO COLLEGE FOR ONE REASON -- THEIR FAMILIES LACK THE MONEY. TO MY MIND, IT IS NOT ONLY UNFAIR TO THESE KIDS TO DENY THEM THE RIGHT TO BECOME DOCTORS OR ENGINEERS OR TEACHERS OR SCIENTISTS OR WHATEVER ELSE -- NOT ONLY UNFAIR TO THEM, BUT IT IS ABSURD WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. WE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKERS IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION WHICH DOES TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS. FIRST, IT SAYS THAT EVERY PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA WILL BE TUITION-FREE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY THIS IDEA, THIS SIMPLE IDEA IS A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA. IT IS NOT JUST THAT IT WILL MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO GET TO COLLEGE. IT WILL CERTAINLY DO THAT. BUT THIS IS WHAT ELSE IT WILL DO -- TODAY IN COLUMBIA, IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT, THERE ARE KIDS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADES. THESE ARE KIDS WHOSE MOM AND DAD DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE. THESE ARE KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO WENT TO COLLEGE AND THE IDEA OF GOING TO COLLEGE, OF MAKING IT INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS IS SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR WILDEST EXPECTATIONS OR DREAMS. BUT, IF WE TELL EVERY KID IN COLUMBIA AND IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT THAT IF YOU STUDY, IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO SCHOOL, IF YOU DO YOUR WORK, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IT WILL IMPACT KIDS FROM THE FIRST GRADE ON UP. AND THE SECOND THING WE HAVE DONE IN A LEGISLATION IS TO ADDRESS THE ABSURDITY OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, SOME YOUNG, SOME NOT SO YOUNG, WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HORRENDOUSLY OPPRESSIVE STUDENT DEBT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE TALKED TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE CRIME IN LIFE WAS SHE WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND IS PRACTICING PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FOR LOW-INCOME PEOPLE. EXACTLY THE KIND OF DOCTORS WE NEED. BUT, FOR DOING THAT, SHE CAME OUT OF SCHOOL $300,000 IN DEBT. I WAS IN IOWA A FEW MONTHS AGO. A YOUNG WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE GRADUATED DENTAL SCHOOL -- $400,000 IN DEBT AT A TIME WHERE WE HAVE A MAJOR DENTAL CRISIS AND WE NEED MORE DENTISTS. I TALKED TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING OFF 25% OF THEIR LIMITED INCOMES IN STUDENT DEBT. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET MARRIED. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET A CAR. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET A HOME. NOW, IN MY VIEW, IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL THAT IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME TODAY AT 2% OR 3% OR 4%, YOU SHOULD NOT BE PAYING 8% OR 10% ON YOUR STUDENT DEBT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THIRD OF ALL, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH HOLDS MOST OF THAT DEBT SHOULD NOT BE PROFITEERING WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES OF WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: PEOPLE SAY TO ME, WELL, BERNIE, THAT IS A GOOD IDEA, BUT IT WILL BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION-FREE AND LOWER STUDENT DEBT. HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR IT? LET ME TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW I WILL PAY FOR IT -- WITH A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WALL STREET DESTROYED THIS ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THEIR GREED AND RECKLESSNESS, THEY WENT BEGGING TO THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BAIL THEM OUT. NOW IT IS WALL STREET'S TIME TO BAIL OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS HUMAN BEINGS, AS PARENTS, ADULTS, THERE IS PERHAPS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN LEAVING THIS PLANET IN A WAY THAT IS HABITABLE FOR OUR KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE DEBATE IS OVER. THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN A VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUS VOICE HAVE TOLD US CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY. AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY TODAY CAUSING DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHAT THE SCIENTISTS TELL US -- IF WE DO NOT GET OUR ACT TOGETHER IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, A BAD SITUATION TODAY WILL BECOME MUCH, MUCH WORSE WITH THE PLANET TEMPERATURE RISING 5 OR 10 DEGREES MORE FAHRENHEIT. MORE DROUGHT, MORE FLOOD, MORE EXTREME WEATHER DISTURBANCES. MORE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. THE UNITED STATES HAS THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD THE WORLD IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT VALUES AND PRIORITIES. I AM THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHICH MEANS I AM THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATS IN OUR POSITION. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW. THE MEDIA FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] MR. SANDERS: THAT IS THE BUDGET PASSED BY THE REPUBLICANS A FEW MONTHS AGO DOES THE FOLLOWING -- IT THROWS 27 MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF HEALTH CARE. IT CUTS PELL GRANTS BY $90 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. IT CUTS NUTRITION PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE WIC PROGRAM, FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR LITTLE KIDS BY BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: THOSE ARE THE PRIORITIES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THOSE ARE NOT AMERICA'S PRIORITIES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, NOT ONLY ARE THEY MAKING MASSIVE CUTS IN HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND OTHER VITALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS, THEIR BUDGET PROPOSES TO GIVE $250 BILLION IN TAX BREAKS TO THE TOP 2/10 OF 1%. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: SO, LET ME TELL MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES -- NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CUT VETERANS PROGRAMS. WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND VETERANS PROGRAMS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO OUR VETERANS, WHO HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MAKING OUR COUNTRY THE KIND OF NATION THAT IT MUST BECOME, WE MUST TALK ABOUT ENDING INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND MAKING MAJOR REFORMS -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND MAKING MAJOR REFORMS TO OUR BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN OVERCOMING OUR LONG LEGACY OF RACISM. WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. IF PEOPLE WERE SITTING IN THIS ROOM 30 YEARS AGO AND SOMEBODY SAID I THINK IN THE YEAR 2008, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN COULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT, THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL LOOK AT HIS IDEAS, HIS VIEWS, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID NO. IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN THAT FAST, BUT IT DID HAPPEN AND WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AND THE STRUGGLE ABSOLUTELY CONTINUES AGAINST SEXISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND OPENING DOORS FOR WOMEN THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: GOD ONLY KNOWS THAT THAT STRUGGLE CONTINUES, BUT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN THE FIGHT FOR GAY RIGHTS. SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS AND WE AS AMERICANS DESERVE A PAT ON THE BACK FOR MAKING REAL PROGRESS IN MAKING US A LESS DISCRIMINATORY SOCIETY IN MANY RESPECTS. BUT, HERE IS THE BAD NEWS -- AS EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS, RACISM REMAINS A MUCH TOO REAL PART OF AMERICAN LIFE. AND IN THAT REGARD, I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SICKNESS OF A MAN WHO CAN WALK INTO A BIBLE STUDY CLASS IN CHARLESTON, PRAY WITH PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM AND THEN TAKE OUT A GUN AND KILL NINE OF THEM. THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY CAN DO THAT. AND WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT OTHER FORMS OF RACISM THAT WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF HATE GROUPS THAT EXIST ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, GROUPS THAT EXIST FOR ONE PURPOSE ALONE AND THAT IS -- IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE -- BUT TO FOMENT HATRED AGAINST AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR GAYS OR IMMIGRANTS OR JEWS -- PEOPLE THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEM. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THOSE GROUPS. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE MUCH MORE ACTIVE IN MAKING SURE -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THESE ARE THE TYPES OF GROUPS THAT EDUCATED THAT SICK MAN. BUT I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THOSE GROUPS. I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE SANDRA BLAND AND MICHAEL BROWN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WALTER SCOTT AND FREDDIE GRAY AND MANY, MANY UNARMED AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO DIED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS OR IN POLICE CUSTODY. NOW, I WAS A MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND LET ME BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED VERY HARD WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT BEING A COP TODAY IS NOT AN EASY JOB AND MOST POLICE OFFICERS ARE HONEST AND TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME ALSO TELL YOU THAT AS IN THE CASE OF ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL, WHEN A POLICE OFFICER BREAKS THE LAW, THAT OFFICER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: FURTHER, WE NEED FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF A BROKEN, BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, BUT LET ME VERY BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE AREAS THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY IN. WHEN I TURN ON THE TV AND I SEE IN SOME CITIES, SMALL CITIES ALL OVER AMERICA, POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HEAVILY MILITARIZED, THAT LOOK LIKE AN INVADING ARMY, THAT IS WRONG. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE BEST POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN AMERICA ARE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHERE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH POLICE OFFICERS AND ARE ABLE TO SAY THERE IS A CRACK HOUSE DOWN THE STREET, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN A POLICE FORCE THAT IS WORKING WITH THEM, NOT AGAINST THEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF BURLINGTON, WE MOVED TOWARDS THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY POLICING -- MAKING POLICE OFFICERS PART OF THE COMMUNITY. WE ALSO -- POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE RUN BY COMMUNITIES BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A ROLE. POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA SHOULD REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE USE OF FORCE DOCTRINE THAT EXISTS IN MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS. GOOD POLICE OFFICERS -- I HAVE SEEN IT PERSONALLY MANY TIMES -- ARE ABLE TO DEFLECT A VOLATILE SITUATION. THAT IS GOOD POLICE WORK. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: MANY OFFICERS ARE TRAINED TO DO THAT. THAT IS TOUGH. I HAVE SEEN POLICE OFFICERS GET IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND LETHAL FORCE IS THE LAST RESORT, NOT THE FIRST. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED TO BEGIN RETHINKING THE WAR ON DRUGS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I FIND IT REMARKABLE AND DISTURBING THAT MANY YOUNG AMERICANS HAVE RECEIVED A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR SMOKING OR POSSESSING MARIJUANA, BUT NOT ONE MAJOR WALL STREET EXECUTIVE HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR DESTROYING OUR ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN CONGRESS RECONVENES IN SEPTEMBER, I WILL BE OFFERING LEGISLATION WHICH ENDS THE ABSURDITY AND INJUSTICE OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS MAKING PROFITS BY BUILDING AND RUNNING JAILS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: CORPORATIONS SHOULD NOT BE MAKING A PROFIT ON THE INCARCERATION OF AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: FURTHER, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUBSTANCE ADDICTION, WHETHER IT IS DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER, IS A DISEASE. IS A DISEASE. IT IS A SERIOUS DISEASE THAT EXISTS IN MY STATE, IT EXISTS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. AND WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY TREAT THAT DISEASE AND NOT SEE IT AS A CRIME. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN DRUG COURTS AND MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IT IS A PRETTY CRAZY SITUATION WHEN MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN JAIL ARE MENTALLY ILL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND I CAN TELL YOU I GET CALLS IN MY OFFICE, OTHER SENATORS GET CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM REALLY WORRIED ABOUT MY BROTHER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO TO HIMSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE, BUT WE CANNOT FIND A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING THAT WE NEED AND CAN AFFORD. THAT IS CRAZY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEVELOP A PATH BACK FROM PRISON. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOBODY SHOULD BE SHOCKED THAT IF SOMEBODY LEAVES PRISON WITHOUT A JOB, WITHOUT EDUCATION, WITHOUT DECENT HOUSING, THEY WILL GO BACK TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY GOT INTO JAIL IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE. BUT KEEP IN MIND, IT COSTS MORE MONEY TO KEEP SOMEBODY IN JAIL THAN TO SEND THEM -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BRINGING OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER, LET US NOT FORGET THAT TODAY THERE ARE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. I WAS IN PHOENIX A FEW WEEKS AGO TALKING TO A GROUP OF YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. TEARS ROLLING OUT OF THEIR EYES BECAUSE THEY WERE FEARFUL OF BEING DEPORTED OR HAVING THEIR PARENTS DEPORTED. WE NEED TO PROVIDE LEGAL PROTECTION NOW FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND WE NEED A PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, AS ALL OF YOU WILL RECALL, THERE WAS A FIERCE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE UNITED STATES SHOULD GO TO WAR IN IRAQ. I LISTENED TO WHAT BUSH AND CHENEY AND DONALD RUMSFELD HAD TO SAY. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: AND I DID NOT BELIEVE THEM. I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ME HAPPY, IT TRULY DOES NOT, TO TELL YOU THAT MUCH OF WHAT I SAID DURING THAT DEBATE -- GO TO YOUTUBE AND LOOK AT WHAT I SAID -- SADLY, MUCH OF WHAT I FEARED WOULD HAPPEN DID HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE DESTABILIZATION OF THE REGION. AND NOW, AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS ANOTHER DEBATE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOW, I FIND IT ASTOUNDING THAT MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN HAVE DONE TO OUR PEOPLE AND TO OUR COUNTRY. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE 6700 BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO DIED. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE YOUNG MEN WHO CAME HOME WITHOUT LEGS AND ARMS. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE 500,000 WHO CAME HOME WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER OR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND, BY THE WAY, IF THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR ANYTHING, WE HAVE TO STAND WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME HOME FROM WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: BUT NOW, THE DEBATE IS OVER IRAN AND WHETHER OR NOT CONGRESS SHOULD APPROVE THE AGREEMENT WORKED ON BY THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY KERRY. WELL, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A PERFECT AGREEMENT. THE UNITED STATES HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH FIVE OTHER COUNTRIES. PLUS GERMANY, PLUS IRAN. BUT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON WITHOUT GOING TO WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IT REALLY, REALLY DOES TROUBLE ME HOW QUICKLY, HOW EASILY IN A SENSE -- PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T WANT THIS AGREEMENT, WE DON'T TRUST IRAN. WE DON'T LIKE IRAN. WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING IS YES, WE WILL GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAN. NOW, A GREAT NATION IS A NATION THAT DOES EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO CULTIVATE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT AND CRAZY WORLD -- NOBODY HAS ANY ANSWERS TO ALL OF THE CRAZINESS IN THIS WORLD. ISIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT, WE SHOULD BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD IN TRYING TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT IN A PEACEFUL WAY AND NOT IN ANOTHER WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TONIGHT IN THIS RATHER HOT ROOM. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING TWO THINGS. FIRST, THIS CAMPAIGN, HONESTLY, IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. I CANNOT DO IT ALONE. WE NEED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO REACH OUT TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY DO NOT CONTINUE TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERESTS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THE SECOND AND LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE, I WANT YOU ALL NOT TO THINK SMALL. I WANT YOU TO THINK BIG. THIS IS THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY, IF WE WERE A HAITI OR SMALL COUNTRY, IT IS TOO BAD WE CANNOT DO THIS. THAT IS NOT AMERICA. WE CAN JOIN THE REST OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD AND GUARANTY HEALTH CARE AS A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN HAVE THE BEST CHILDCARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD, NOT A DYSFUNCTIONAL ONE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN JOIN OTHER COUNTRIES AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF INCOME, CAN GET A HIGHER EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT EVERY SENIOR IN OUR COUNTRY CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY AND SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN : THAT A VETERAN THAT HIS OR HER LIFE TO DEFEND US GETS THE QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND BENEFITS THEY HAVE EARNED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO AMERICAN, REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, THEIR RELIGION, THEIR DISABILITY, OR THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS REALIZE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE QUALITY THAT IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT AS AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS A NATION, IF WE DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO DIVIDE US UP BY RACE OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR THE COUNTRY WE CAME FROM, THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING THAT TOGETHER WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) KEEP ON ROCKING IN THE FREE WORLD (music) (music) KEEP ON ROCKING IN THE FREE WORLD (music) (music) WE HAVE A THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT WE HAVE A KINDER, GENTLER MACHINE GUN HAND (music) >> BERNIE, SAY HI TO MY SISTER FOR ME. >> THANK YOU, BERNIE. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327822-1/hillary-clinton-remarks-rural-policy,Hillary Clinton Remarks on Rural Policy,Hillary Rodham Clinton,"2, TELEVISION FOR SERIOUS READERS. >> BERNIE SANDERS SPOKE TO SUPPORTERS AT A RALLY IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, FOLLOWING HIS REMARKS, HE ALSO TOOK SOME QUESTIONS FROM VIEWERS. THIS IS JUST UNDER TWO HOURS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE LAST STOP OF THE EVENING. WE ARE EXCITED TO BE IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY FOR BERNIE 2016. I WILL BE YOUR MC FOR THIS EVENING. BEFORE I BRING OUT THE MAN OF THE HOUR, I WANT TO CHAT WITH YOU ALL. DID YOU KNOW, AMERICA CELEBRATED THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS MOMENT, LANDMARK LEGISLATION. AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. BUT THE SUPREME COURT 2013 DECISION GETTING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS A SHAMEFUL STEP BACKWARDS. IT WAS. TODAY WE KNOW OUR VOTING RIGHTS, FAMILY VALUES, THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND A BLACK LIVES ARE UNDER ATTACK. WE KNOW WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. WE NEED PEOPLE WE TRUST AT LEADING THIS COUNTRY TO GET THE WORK DONE. AM I RIGHT? WE NEED NEW VOICES THAT ARE NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT THE INJUSTICES PLAGUING PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE PLIGHT OF EVERYDAY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE CRITICAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW WHICH PROTECTED VOTERS IN PLACES WITH A HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION IS AS NECESSARY TODAY AS IT WAS DURING THE JIM CROW ERA. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY ARE PARALLEL ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY. PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO REFORMING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO WE ARE NOT LOCKING UP ALL GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE. BUT WE ARE INSTEAD ENDING THE DISGRACE THAT IS THE MASS INCARCERATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE WHO TRULY BELIEVE AND ARE WORKING TO ENSURE EVERY SINGLE YOUNG PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY RECEIVES A SHOT AT A QUALITY AFFORDABLE EDUCATION. PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE SANDERS. IF YOU BELIEVE LIKE I DO THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS THE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO. YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST VERY IMPORTANT STEP UP BY ATTENDING THIS TOWN HALL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [APPLAUSE] >> THIS PASSION YOU FEEL, THIS BURN, WE WANT YOU TO VISIT OUR WEBSITE. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. DONATE TO THE CAMPAIGN. THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO TO GET INVOLVED IS YOU CAN TEXT TO BERNIE TO 82623. THAT WILL GIVE YOU REAL TIME UPDATES. THE LAST THING YOU CAN DO IS FOLLOW US ON TWITTER. @BERNIESANDERS ON TWITTER. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SPREADING THIS MESSAGE, THIS MULTIRACIAL REVOLUTION, THIS FIGHT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE. ECONOMIC JUSTICE. RACIAL JUSTICE. ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] >> AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IT IS MY PLEASURE AND HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, UNITED STATES SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. [APPLAUSE] (music) [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THANK YOU. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE COULD SQUEEZE TOO MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. AND LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE OVERFLOW ROOM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT 3.5 MONTHS AGO. WHEN WE BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE WERE SAYING BERNIE SANDERS, INTERESTING GUY BUT KIND OF A FRINGE TYPE CANDIDATE. I MEAN NO ONE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY THE IDEA THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, WE NEED A POLITICAL REVOLUTION IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN ALMOST ALL OF THE NEW INCOME IS GOING TO THE TOP 1%. [APPLAUSE] MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY AND MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STARTED COMING OUT. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WE WERE ON THE WEST COAST AND WE HAD 15,000 PEOPLE IN SEATTLE. 28,000 PEOPLE IN PORTLAND, OREGON. AND WE HAD 27,000 PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES. IT SEEMS TO ME THE IDEAS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT FRINGE IDEAS, THEY ARE THE IDEAS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A CAMPAIGN ON THE MOVE. THIS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT IS GOING TO WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT THE ENTHUSIASM AND THE EXCITEMENT FOR THIS CAMPAIGN HASN'T JUST LAUNCHED TURNOUTS. PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES CONTROL OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. I DO NOT REPRESENT THE BILLIONAIRES' AGENDA. I DO NOT WANT THEIR MONEY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY SUPERPAC AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE ARE RAISING MONEY FOR THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM 400,000 AMERICANS. AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION, $31. I'M PROUD OF THAT. WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT IS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE DO NOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE DIVIDED, IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS BLACK AND WHITE AND HISPANIC, NATIVE AMERICAN, MEN AND WOMEN, STRAIGHT AND GAY, NATIVEBORN AND IMMIGRANT -- [APPLAUSE] IF WE STAND TOGETHER, THEY MAY HAVE ALL THE POWER. BUT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE. WHEN PEOPLE STAND TOGETHER, WE WIN. WHERE EVER I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY, MEDIA COME UP TO ME AND SAY, WE ARE SURPRISED, WHY IS THERE SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM? WHY ARE YOU MOVING UP IN THE POLLS? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT MY ANSWER IS TO THEM. MY ANSWER IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED WITH ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED WITH ESTABLISHMENT ECONOMICS. AND FRANKLY, THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA. [APPLAUSE] THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT CORPORATE GREED, THIS NEVER ENDING GREED OF NEEDING MORE AND MORE NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY HAVE, THAT CORPORATE GREED IS DESTROYING OUR ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND, AND I SPEAK HERE AS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE VETERANS COMMITTEE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT MEN AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND SOMETIMES LOST THEIR LIVES DEFENDING DEMOCRACY AND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN BILLIONAIRES ARE BUYING ELECTIONS. THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AT A TIME WHEN THIS COUNTRY FACES SO MANY ENORMOUS PROBLEMS, WHEN WE NEED SERIOUS DISCUSSION, THAT MUCH OF THE CORPORATE MEDIA WILL TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING WORKING AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN BE. THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS OR HILLARY CLINTON. IT IS NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, JEB BUSH OR ANYONE ELSE. IT IS ABOUT YOU, YOUR KIDS, YOUR PARENTS, AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] >> BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE. MR. SANDERS: AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RUN FOR OFFICE A NUMBER OF TIMES IN VERMONT, I HAVE NEVER RUN A NEGATIVE POLITICAL AD IN MY LIFE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WHAT POLITICS AND A DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT IS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY AND PROPOSE IDEAS AND LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DISCUSS THEM. I THINK IT IS ABSURD FOR POLITICIANS TO SAY, I AM GREAT, I AM WONDERFUL, EVERYONE ELSE IS TERRIBLE. THAT IS WRONG. WHAT WE NEED IS A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: OUR CAMPAIGN IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CAMPAIGNS, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE FACT THAT IT WE HAVE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE VISION, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN HOW WE ARE RUNNING THIS CAMPAIGN. I BELIEVE, AND LET ME BE HONEST WITH YOU AND TELL YOU WHAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WILL TELL YOU, THAT NO MATTER WHO IS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NO MATTER HOW GOOD HE OR SHE MAY BE, THAT PERSON CANNOT ADDRESS THE ENORMOUS PROBLEMS FACING WORKING FAMILIES AND THE MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF BIG MONEY INTERESTS IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE TRUTH AND IT IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH. WHAT I AM CALLING FOR IS NOT JUST YOUR SUPPORT TO ELECT TO ME AS PRESIDENT, I'M ASKING YOU TO BE PART OF A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. [APPLAUSE] A REVOLUTION WHICH TRANSFORMS OUR COUNTRY ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY, SOCIALLY, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS ABOUT IS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM COAST TO COAST, STANDING UP AND SAYING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THIS GREAT NATION AND OUR GOVERNMENT BELONG TO ALL OF US, NOT JUST TO A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS, THE SAD TRUTH, THE TRUTH IS OUR COUNTRY FACES MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND IF YOU THROW IN THE GLOBAL CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE PROBLEMS MAY BE WORSE TODAY. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS UNLESS WE ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY. I STARTED WITH THE ISSUE OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. TODAY, AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. MOST AMERICANS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, DON'T PERCEIVE THAT, DON'T FEEL THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BUSY WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS WHILE THE REST ARE GOING TO THE TOP 1%. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE TRUTH IS THE UNITED STATES TODAY HAS MORE INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION ON EARTH. THE INEQUALITY TODAY IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT IS WORSE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE 1928. SO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE GETTING RICHER AND RICHER. EVERYBODY ELSE IS BECOMING POORER AND POORER. THE TRUTH IS NO GREAT NATION CAN SURVIVE ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY WHEN SO FEW HAVE SO MUCH AND SO MANY HAVE SO LITTLE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG AND PROFOUNDLY IMMORAL. BY THE WAY, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE START INJECTING MORALITY INTO OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. NOT 1%, 1/10 OF 1% OWNS ALMOST AS MUCH[,] AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A PROLIFERATION OF MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES BUT ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. WE END UP WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN ONE FAMILY, ONE FAMILY, THIS IS AMERICA NOT PARAGUAY, NOT SOME SMALL THIRD WORLD COUNTRY, WHEN ONE FAMILY, THE WALTON FAMILY OF WALMART, OWNS MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 40% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. WHEN PEOPLE ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS, TRYING TO GET SOME INCOME AND HEALTH CARE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. WHEN THAT IS GOING ON, WELL, A HANDFULL OF BILLIONAIRES ARE MAKING OUT LIKE BANDITS. THIS IS A RIGGED ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: TOGETHER, YOU AND I AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES, NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. [APPLAUSE] THIS CAMPAIGN IS SENDING A SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD MESSAGE TO THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS. THAT IS YOU CANNOT, YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT ALL. [APPLAUSE] THE CEOS OF LARGE CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRE CLASS ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET HUGE TAX BREAKS WHEN CHILDREN IN AMERICA GO HUNGRY. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEND OUR JOBS TO CHINA AND OTHER LOW-WAGE COUNTRIES WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF WORK RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: CORPORATE AMERICA AND THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS ARE NOT GOING TO HIDE THEIR MANY BILLIONS IN PROFITS BY PUTTING THEM IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND OTHER TAX HAVENS. THEY ARE GOING TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. [APPLAUSE] WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT, THEIR GREED IS GOING TO END BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO END IT FOR THEM. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY, LET ME BRING IT ON HOME TO WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE WEALTHIEST 14 PEOPLE IN AMERICA, 14 PEOPLE, SAW THEIR WEALTH INCREASE BY $156 BILLION. HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHILE 14 PEOPLE SAW AN UNBELIEVABLE INCREASE IN THEIR WEALTH, 27% OF THE CHILDREN HERE ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. ALMOST 300,000 CHILDREN. 14 PEOPLE INCREASED WEALTH $156 BILLION. 27% OF THE KIDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA LIVING IN POVERTY. OF THOSE CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY, 138,000 ARE BLACK, 95,000 ARE WHITE AND 34,000 ARE HISPANIC. CHILDHOOD POVERTY IMPACTS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE REALITY. LET'S LAY IT ON THE TABLE. BILLIONAIRES BECOME RICHER WHILE CHILDREN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND ALL OVER AMERICA LACK ADEQUATE NUTRITION. IN THE YEAR 2015 IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IN VERMONT AND THROUGHOUT AMERICA, CHILDREN ARE GOING HUNGRY. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT BILLIONAIRES BECOME RICHER WHEN KIDS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE STARVING. [APPLAUSE] IF WE ARE A MORAL PEOPLE, WE GIVE THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. TO TURN OUR BACKS ON THE CHILDREN WHILE BILLIONAIRES GET RICHER IS NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BASIC NEEDS, LET US NOT FORGET THAT WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] NOW I LIVE IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT, AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE CANADIAN BORDER. THE CANADIANS GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO EVERY PEOPLE. IN THE U.K., THEY GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE. GERMANY, FRANCE, SCANDINAVIA DOES IT. EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY DOES IT ACCEPT US AND THAT IS WHY I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN A MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE IN SINGLE PAYMENT BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS BELIEVES IN, BUT THE CONGRESS DID PASS, AND THE PRESIDENT DID FIND, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. BY EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS NOW HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHO PREVIOUSLY LACKED IT. THAT IS A GOOD THING. [APPLAUSE] THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS CUT ARKANSAS' UNINSURED POPULATION ALMOST IN HALF. IT HAS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN KENTUCKY FROM 20% TO 12%. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IN SOUTH CAROLINA, OVER 200,000 PEOPLE WOULD GAIN HEALTH INSURANCE IF THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE EXPANSION. [APPLAUSE] NOT ONLY WOULD SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE GAIN HEALTH INSURANCE, THE STATE WOULD CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PICKS UP ALMOST ALL OF THE BILL. PRETTY GOOD DEAL. [APPLAUSE] IN MY VIEW, IT IS TERRIBLY WRONG TO ALLOW A RIGID, RIGHT-WING, POLITICAL IDEOLOGY TO STAND IN THE WAY OF HEALTH CARE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOUTH CAROLINIANS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WRONG TO ALLOW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL STATE TO DIE UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GO TO A DOCTOR WHEN THEY SHOULD. IT IS WRONG AND IMMORAL TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE WILL SUFFER AND BECOME MUCH SICKER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE MEDICAID. THAT IS WRONG. [APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD HOPE VERY MUCH THAT NOT ONLY HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES WOULD LET GO FOR ONE MINUTE OF THE RIGHT WING IDEOLOGY AND TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATE. [APPLAUSE] I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE LEGISLATURES AND GOVERNORS HATE PRESIDENT OBAMA. YOU CAN HATE PRESIDENT OBAMA, BUT DO NOT HATE THE KIDS AND THE WORKING FAMILIES IN YOUR STATE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT JUST THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME INEQUALITY. IT IS THE REALITIES THAT FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS OF OUR COUNTRY, ONCE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD, HAS BEEN DISAPPEARING. THE TRUTH IS WE ARE MUCH BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEFT OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] LET US NOT FORGET THAT WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE, WE WERE HEMORRHAGING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE AND WE WERE RUNNING UP A $1.4 TRILLION DEFICIT. I FIND IT INTERESTING REPUBLICANS COMPLAIN THEY ARE ONLY GROWING 250,000 JOBS A MONTH. THAT IS A LOT BETTER THAN LOSING 800,000 JOBS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: HERE IS THE POINT -- YES, WE ARE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TODAY ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. ALL OF YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION IN TECHNOLOGY MAKING WORKERS FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN THEY USED TO BE. AND YET, MANY OF THOSE WORKERS HAVE SEEN THEIR REAL WAGES GO DOWN. SINCE 1999, MEDIUM FAMILY INCOME TODAY IS ALMOST $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS IN 1999. THAT IS OUR REALITY. WE ARE BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE 6.5 YEARS AGO BUT WE CONTINUE TO FIND AND SEE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR MIDDLE-CLASS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS COME UP WITH PROPOSAL AFTER PROPOSAL THAT REBUILDS THE CRUMBLING MIDDLE-CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU. EVERY MONTH, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COMES OUT WITH THINGS. UNEMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA IS 5.3%. WRONG. THAT OFFICIAL STATISTIC DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR WORK AND THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING PART-TIME. ADD THAT ALTOGETHER, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS OVER 10%. THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE MUST DEAL WITH. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PUSH UNDER THE RUG. I ASKED THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE TO DO A STUDY ON YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IN THIS COUNTRY? IN TERMS OF KID TO HAVE NO JOBS, OR ARE WORKING PART-TIME WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME, WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THE KIDS 17 TO 20 WHO GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY WERE WHITE, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 33%. IF THEY WERE HISPANIC, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 36%. IF THEY WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 51%. [BOOING] WE ARE TURNING OUR BACKS ON AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAND ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. ONE OF THE GREAT SHAMES IN OUR COUNTRY, ONE OF THE GREAT INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT IS WE AS A NATION HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] CHINA, A NATION THREE TIMES LARGER THAN US, A COMMUNIST, AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRY HAS FEWER PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN WE DO. IF ANYBODY HERE THINKS THERE IS NOT A CONNECTION BETWEEN HUGE RATES OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND KIDS THAT END UP IN JAIL, YOU WOULD BE VERY MISTAKEN. RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, IN MY STATE, YOUR STATE, WE ARE 5.5 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL, WHO ARE NOT WORKING, WHO ARE HANGING OUT IN STREET CORNERS AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE. IN MY VIEW, IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE FOR US TO BE INVESTING IN EDUCATION AND IN JOBS. [APPLAUSE] IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO BE INVESTING IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAN IN JAILS AND INCARCERATION. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, IT IS NOT JUST INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY AND IT IS NOT JUST HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. IT IS THE SIMPLE FACT THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT MILLIONS OF OUR PEOPLE ARE WORKING AT WAGES THAT ARE TOO DAMN LOW. [APPLAUSE] THE CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF $7.25 AN HOUR, $7.25 AN HOUR -- [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: -- IS A STARVATION WAGE. OUR JOB IS TO RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO A LIVING WAGE -- $15 AN HOUR OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA TO SAY THAT IF SOMEBODY WORKS 40 HOURS A WEEK, THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE LIVING IN POVERTY. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS IN WAGES, I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM WILL STAND WITH THE WOMEN AND PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE TOO MANY WOMEN IN AMERICA TRYING TO BRING UP THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE MAKING $.78 ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO MEN. PAY EQUITY WILL TAKE A HUGE CHUNK OUT OF POVERTY IN AMERICA AND WE MUST FIGHT TO ESTABLISH PAY EQUITY. [APPLAUSE] I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES RUN AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. THEY JUST LOVE FAMILIES. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS WOMEN IN AMERICA SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES. I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IN THEIR CONCEPT OF FAMILY VALUES IS THAT WOMEN ARE TOO DUMB TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE CONTRACEPTIVE THEY NEED. I DISAGREE. WHAT THEY ARE ALSO SAYING IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF FAMILY VALUES IS THAT ARE GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED AND ENJOY ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] I AM VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE FOUR KIDS, SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN. JANE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 27 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE, WE BELIEVE IN FAMILY AND WE BELIEVE IN STRONGLY PROTECTING THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES, BUT MY FAMILY VALUES ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN REPUBLICAN FAMILY VALUES. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES, I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST END THE INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT OF BEING THE ONLY, ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE WORKERS PAID MEDICAL AND FAMILY LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN A WOMAN HAS A BABY TODAY, IF SHE HAS THE INCOME AND THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT, SHE CAN STAY HOME AND GET TO LOVE HER BABY, BOND WITH HER BABY. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE PARENTS, IT IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCES OF BEING HUMAN. [APPLAUSE] IT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT FOR THE BABY AS WELL. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS A FAMILY VALUE. IT IS A FAMILY VALUE WHEN MOM STAYS HOME, NOURISHES THE BABY, GETS TO KNOW HER BABY AND DAD IS THERE AS WELL. IT IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE TO TELL THAT MOM THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR BABY AND GO BACK TO WORK IN FIVE DAYS OR EIGHT DAYS. THAT IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE SUPPORTED AND WILL FIGHT FOR LEGISLATION THAT GUARANTEES EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY OR MEDICAL LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A FAMILY VALUE. IF EVERY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH COULD DO IT, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA COULD DO IT, TOO. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE REMAIN THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE SICK TIME TO OUR WORKERS OR PAID VACATION. THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE, TOO. [APPLAUSE] WITH REAL UNEMPLOYMENT OVER 10%, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT, WE NEED ON MAJOR FEDERAL JOBS PROGRAM TO PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] AT A TIME WHEN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING, OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR WATER SYSTEMS, WASTE WATER PLANTS, AIRPORTS, LEVIES, DAMS -- THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH WORK TO DO. A $1 TRILLION INVESTMENT OVER FIVE YEARS COULD CREATE OVER 13 MILLION DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- IT IS NOT ONLY THE ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE OF HAVING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, IT IS ALSO THE ABSOLUTE NEED TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF MORE JOBS BECAUSE OF OUR DISASTROUS TRADE POLICIES. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SENATOR AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE WHO VOTED AGAINST NAFTA, CAPFA, AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SENATOR WHO WILL HELP LEAD THE EFFORT AGAINST THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED, WE NEED TRADE POLICIES WHICH CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA, NOT IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WHEN WE USE WORDS LIKE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS AND ARROGANCE AND DISHONESTY, WE ONLY HAVE SOME OF THE ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE WALL STREET. ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT AS A RESULT OF THE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS OF WALL STREET, OUR ECONOMY WAS BROUGHT TO ITS KNEES, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS, THEIR HOUSES AND THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. TODAY, AFTER BAILING OUT WALL STREET BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BIG TO FAIL, THREE OUT OF THE FOUR LARGEST BANKS ARE BIGGER NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE WE BAILED THEM OUT. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: IN MY VIEW -- LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS -- WHEN YOU HAVE SIX BANKS ISSUING TWO THIRDS OF THE CREDIT CARDS IN THIS COUNTRY, 35% OF THE MORTGAGES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHEN YOU HAVE BANKS THAT ARE TOO BIG TO FAIL, THEY ARE TOO BIG TO EXIST. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED A FINANCIAL SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES AFFORDABLE LOANS TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN CREATE THE JOBS WE NEED. WE DO NOT NEED A FINANCIAL SYSTEM ON WALL STREET WHICH IS AN ISLAND UNTO ITSELF WHICH IS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT PROFITS FOR A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] I AM OFTEN ASKED, WELL, BERNIE, WHICH OF THE ISSUES OUT THERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER BECAUSE ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. HERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT IMPACTS EVERY OTHER ISSUE AND THAT IS FIVE YEARS AGO, AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE SUPREME COURT BY A 5-4 DECISION IN THE CITIZENS UNITED -- [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: IN THE CITIZENS UNITED CASE, WHAT THEY SAID TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, THEY SAID YOU GUYS ALREADY OWN MUCH OF THE ECONOMY. WE ARE NOW GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO OWN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE ONE FAMILY, THE EXTREME RIGHT WING KOCH BROTHERS. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: THE SECOND WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN AMERICA IS PREPARED TO SPEND $900 MILLION IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE. THAT IS MORE MONEY THAN EITHER PARTY WILL SPEND. WHEN YOU HAVE ONE FAMILY SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN EITHER OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. THAT IS OLIGARCHY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE NOT MADE MANY CAMPAIGN PROMISES, BUT THIS IS ONE I HAVE MADE AND WILL NOMINEE OF MINE TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WILL GET THAT POSITION UNLESS HE OR SHE IS LOUD AND CLEAR IN SAYING THAT ONE OF THEIR FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS WILL IN FACT BE RE-HEAR ING AND TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I AM A PASSIONATE BELIEVER IN DEMOCRACY. I REALLY BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. AND WHAT THAT MEANS, WHAT THAT VERY RADICAL IDEA MEANS -- ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YEARS OLD -- WHAT THAT IDEA MEANS IS THAT YOU AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, POOR PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE, ANYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE AND SHAPE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND NOT JUST A KING OR QUEEN OR A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. THAT IS A RADICAL IDEA THAT I BELIEVE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IN MY VIEW, NOT ONLY MUST WE OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED, WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER. I WANT TO SEE THIS COUNTRY HAVE THE MOST VIBRANT DEMOCRACY OF ANY COUNTRY ON EARTH. I WANT TO SEE US HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUTS, NOT ONE OF THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUTS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I WANT TO SEE A PROCESS IN WHICH ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM, ANYBODY IN AMERICA WHETHER YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE, PROGRESSIVE, MODERATE -- IF YOU BELIEVE YOU WANT TO GET INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR IDEAS, I WANT TO SEE YOU BE ABLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE WITHOUT BEGGING MONEY FROM THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN WASHINGTON, I WAS AT AN EVENT WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING, III AND PEOPLE WITH THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONGRESS. A VERY GOOD CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. AND WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THAT MEETING WAS TO, FIRST OF ALL, CELEBRATE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY -- AND SOMEONE MENTIONED THIS EARLIER. OF THE ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS ACT. OK? [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHAT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS ABOUT WAS TO SAY THE GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, MANY IN THE SOUTH, WILL SAY SORRY, ALL PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THAT WAS A GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR DEMOCRACY, BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO, THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED A VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST TO THE SOUTH, BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE, TO DENY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE, THOSE PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH THE POWERS THAT BE. AND THEY ARE UNSAFE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: YOU KNOW, I TAKE THAT KIND OF PERSONALLY AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. I HAVE RUN FOR OFFICE IN MY OWN STATE MANY TIMES. SOMETIMES I HAVE LOST. MOST TIMES I HAVE WON. BUT IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME, NEVER, NOT FOR ONE SECOND TO SAY THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT SYMPATHETIC TO ME, HOW DO I FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STOP THOSE PEOPLE FROM VOTING? IF YOU CANNOT RUN FOR OFFICE AND DEFEND YOUR IDEAS, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT RUN FOR OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: PEOPLE, LEGISLATURES, GOVERNORS WHO TRY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM VOTING BECAUSE THEY MAY VOTE AGAINST A GOVERNOR OR THE LEGISLATURES ARE NOTHING LESS THAN POLITICAL COWARDS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION WHICH MORE OR LESS SAYS THAT IF YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YOU ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, END OF DISCUSSION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN IS A VERY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AND IF OUR NATION IS GOING TO SUCCEED ECONOMICALLY, WE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WHAT SADDENS ME VERY MUCH IS AS WE SPEAK HERE TONIGHT, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT, YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY -- KIDS WHO HAVE DONE REALLY WELL IN SCHOOL. KIDS WERE QUALIFIED TO GET INTO COLLEGE, BUT THEY CANNOT GET INTO COLLEGE FOR ONE REASON -- THEIR FAMILIES LACK THE MONEY. TO MY MIND, IT IS NOT ONLY UNFAIR TO THESE KIDS TO DENY THEM THE RIGHT TO BECOME DOCTORS OR ENGINEERS OR TEACHERS OR SCIENTISTS OR WHATEVER ELSE -- NOT ONLY UNFAIR TO THEM, BUT IT IS ABSURD WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. WE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKERS IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION WHICH DOES TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS. FIRST, IT SAYS THAT EVERY PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA WILL BE TUITION-FREE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY THIS IDEA, THIS SIMPLE IDEA IS A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA. IT IS NOT JUST THAT IT WILL MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO GET TO COLLEGE. IT WILL CERTAINLY DO THAT. BUT THIS IS WHAT ELSE IT WILL DO -- TODAY IN COLUMBIA, IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT, THERE ARE KIDS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADES. THESE ARE KIDS WHOSE MOM AND DAD DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE. THESE ARE KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO WENT TO COLLEGE AND THE IDEA OF GOING TO COLLEGE, OF MAKING IT INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS IS SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR WILDEST EXPECTATIONS OR DREAMS. BUT, IF WE TELL EVERY KID IN COLUMBIA AND IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT THAT IF YOU STUDY, IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO SCHOOL, IF YOU DO YOUR WORK, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IT WILL IMPACT KIDS FROM THE FIRST GRADE ON UP. AND THE SECOND THING WE HAVE DONE IN A LEGISLATION IS TO ADDRESS THE ABSURDITY OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, SOME YOUNG, SOME NOT SO YOUNG, WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HORRENDOUSLY OPPRESSIVE STUDENT DEBT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE TALKED TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE CRIME IN LIFE WAS SHE WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND IS PRACTICING PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FOR LOW-INCOME PEOPLE. EXACTLY THE KIND OF DOCTORS WE NEED. BUT, FOR DOING THAT, SHE CAME OUT OF SCHOOL $300,000 IN DEBT. I WAS IN IOWA A FEW MONTHS AGO. A YOUNG WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE GRADUATED DENTAL SCHOOL -- $400,000 IN DEBT AT A TIME WHERE WE HAVE A MAJOR DENTAL CRISIS AND WE NEED MORE DENTISTS. I TALKED TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING OFF 25% OF THEIR LIMITED INCOMES IN STUDENT DEBT. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET MARRIED. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET A CAR. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET A HOME. NOW, IN MY VIEW, IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL THAT IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME TODAY AT 2% OR 3% OR 4%, YOU SHOULD NOT BE PAYING 8% OR 10% ON YOUR STUDENT DEBT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THIRD OF ALL, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH HOLDS MOST OF THAT DEBT SHOULD NOT BE PROFITEERING WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES OF WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: PEOPLE SAY TO ME, WELL, BERNIE, THAT IS A GOOD IDEA, BUT IT WILL BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION-FREE AND LOWER STUDENT DEBT. HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR IT? LET ME TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW I WILL PAY FOR IT -- WITH A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WALL STREET DESTROYED THIS ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THEIR GREED AND RECKLESSNESS, THEY WENT BEGGING TO THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BAIL THEM OUT. NOW IT IS WALL STREET'S TIME TO BAIL OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS HUMAN BEINGS, AS PARENTS, ADULTS, THERE IS PERHAPS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN LEAVING THIS PLANET IN A WAY THAT IS HABITABLE FOR OUR KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE DEBATE IS OVER. THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN A VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUS VOICE HAVE TOLD US CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY. AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY TODAY CAUSING DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHAT THE SCIENTISTS TELL US -- IF WE DO NOT GET OUR ACT TOGETHER IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, A BAD SITUATION TODAY WILL BECOME MUCH, MUCH WORSE WITH THE PLANET TEMPERATURE RISING 5 OR 10 DEGREES MORE FAHRENHEIT. MORE DROUGHT, MORE FLOOD, MORE EXTREME WEATHER DISTURBANCES. MORE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. THE UNITED STATES HAS THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD THE WORLD IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT VALUES AND PRIORITIES. I AM THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHICH MEANS I AM THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATS IN OUR POSITION. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW. THE MEDIA FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] MR. SANDERS: THAT IS THE BUDGET PASSED BY THE REPUBLICANS A FEW MONTHS AGO DOES THE FOLLOWING -- IT THROWS 27 MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF HEALTH CARE. IT CUTS PELL GRANTS BY $90 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. IT CUTS NUTRITION PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE WIC PROGRAM, FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR LITTLE KIDS BY BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: THOSE ARE THE PRIORITIES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THOSE ARE NOT AMERICA'S PRIORITIES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, NOT ONLY ARE THEY MAKING MASSIVE CUTS IN HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND OTHER VITALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS, THEIR BUDGET PROPOSES TO GIVE $250 BILLION IN TAX BREAKS TO THE TOP 2/10 OF 1%. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: SO, LET ME TELL MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES -- NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CUT VETERANS PROGRAMS. WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND VETERANS PROGRAMS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO OUR VETERANS, WHO HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MAKING OUR COUNTRY THE KIND OF NATION THAT IT MUST BECOME, WE MUST TALK ABOUT ENDING INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND MAKING MAJOR REFORMS -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND MAKING MAJOR REFORMS TO OUR BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN OVERCOMING OUR LONG LEGACY OF RACISM. WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. IF PEOPLE WERE SITTING IN THIS ROOM 30 YEARS AGO AND SOMEBODY SAID I THINK IN THE YEAR 2008, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN COULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT, THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL LOOK AT HIS IDEAS, HIS VIEWS, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID NO. IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN THAT FAST, BUT IT DID HAPPEN AND WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AND THE STRUGGLE ABSOLUTELY CONTINUES AGAINST SEXISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND OPENING DOORS FOR WOMEN THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: GOD ONLY KNOWS THAT THAT STRUGGLE CONTINUES, BUT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN THE FIGHT FOR GAY RIGHTS. SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS AND WE AS AMERICANS DESERVE A PAT ON THE BACK FOR MAKING REAL PROGRESS IN MAKING US A LESS DISCRIMINATORY SOCIETY IN MANY RESPECTS. BUT, HERE IS THE BAD NEWS -- AS EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS, RACISM REMAINS A MUCH TOO REAL PART OF AMERICAN LIFE. AND IN THAT REGARD, I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SICKNESS OF A MAN WHO CAN WALK INTO A BIBLE STUDY CLASS IN CHARLESTON, PRAY WITH PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM AND THEN TAKE OUT A GUN AND KILL NINE OF THEM. THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY CAN DO THAT. AND WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT OTHER FORMS OF RACISM THAT WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF HATE GROUPS THAT EXIST ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, GROUPS THAT EXIST FOR ONE PURPOSE ALONE AND THAT IS -- IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE -- BUT TO FOMENT HATRED AGAINST AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR GAYS OR IMMIGRANTS OR JEWS -- PEOPLE THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEM. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THOSE GROUPS. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE MUCH MORE ACTIVE IN MAKING SURE -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THESE ARE THE TYPES OF GROUPS THAT EDUCATED THAT SICK MAN. BUT I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THOSE GROUPS. I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE SANDRA BLAND AND MICHAEL BROWN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WALTER SCOTT AND FREDDIE GRAY AND MANY, MANY UNARMED AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO DIED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS OR IN POLICE CUSTODY. NOW, I WAS A MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND LET ME BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED VERY HARD WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT BEING A COP TODAY IS NOT AN EASY JOB AND MOST POLICE OFFICERS ARE HONEST AND TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME ALSO TELL YOU THAT AS IN THE CASE OF ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL, WHEN A POLICE OFFICER BREAKS THE LAW, THAT OFFICER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: FURTHER, WE NEED FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF A BROKEN, BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, BUT LET ME VERY BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE AREAS THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY IN. WHEN I TURN ON THE TV AND I SEE IN SOME CITIES, SMALL CITIES ALL OVER AMERICA, POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HEAVILY MILITARIZED, THAT LOOK LIKE AN INVADING ARMY, THAT IS WRONG. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE BEST POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN AMERICA ARE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHERE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH POLICE OFFICERS AND ARE ABLE TO SAY THERE IS A CRACK HOUSE DOWN THE STREET, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN A POLICE FORCE THAT IS WORKING WITH THEM, NOT AGAINST THEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF BURLINGTON, WE MOVED TOWARDS THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY POLICING -- MAKING POLICE OFFICERS PART OF THE COMMUNITY. WE ALSO -- POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE RUN BY COMMUNITIES BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A ROLE. POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA SHOULD REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE USE OF FORCE DOCTRINE THAT EXISTS IN MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS. GOOD POLICE OFFICERS -- I HAVE SEEN IT PERSONALLY MANY TIMES -- ARE ABLE TO DEFLECT A VOLATILE SITUATION. THAT IS GOOD POLICE WORK. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: MANY OFFICERS ARE TRAINED TO DO THAT. THAT IS TOUGH. I HAVE SEEN POLICE OFFICERS GET IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND LETHAL FORCE IS THE LAST RESORT, NOT THE FIRST. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED TO BEGIN RETHINKING THE WAR ON DRUGS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I FIND IT REMARKABLE AND DISTURBING THAT MANY YOUNG AMERICANS HAVE RECEIVED A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR SMOKING OR POSSESSING MARIJUANA, BUT NOT ONE MAJOR WALL STREET EXECUTIVE HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR DESTROYING OUR ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN CONGRESS RECONVENES IN SEPTEMBER, I WILL BE OFFERING LEGISLATION WHICH ENDS THE ABSURDITY AND INJUSTICE OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS MAKING PROFITS BY BUILDING AND RUNNING JAILS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: CORPORATIONS SHOULD NOT BE MAKING A PROFIT ON THE INCARCERATION OF AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: FURTHER, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUBSTANCE ADDICTION, WHETHER IT IS DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER, IS A DISEASE. IS A DISEASE. IT IS A SERIOUS DISEASE THAT EXISTS IN MY STATE, IT EXISTS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. AND WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY TREAT THAT DISEASE AND NOT SEE IT AS A CRIME. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN DRUG COURTS AND MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IT IS A PRETTY CRAZY SITUATION WHEN MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN JAIL ARE MENTALLY ILL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND I CAN TELL YOU I GET CALLS IN MY OFFICE, OTHER SENATORS GET CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM REALLY WORRIED ABOUT MY BROTHER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO TO HIMSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE, BUT WE CANNOT FIND A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING THAT WE NEED AND CAN AFFORD. THAT IS CRAZY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEVELOP A PATH BACK FROM PRISON. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOBODY SHOULD BE SHOCKED THAT IF SOMEBODY LEAVES PRISON WITHOUT A JOB, WITHOUT EDUCATION, WITHOUT DECENT HOUSING, THEY WILL GO BACK TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY GOT INTO JAIL IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE. BUT KEEP IN MIND, IT COSTS MORE MONEY TO KEEP SOMEBODY IN JAIL THAN TO SEND THEM -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BRINGING OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER, LET US NOT FORGET THAT TODAY THERE ARE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. I WAS IN PHOENIX A FEW WEEKS AGO TALKING TO A GROUP OF YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. TEARS ROLLING OUT OF THEIR EYES BECAUSE THEY WERE FEARFUL OF BEING DEPORTED OR HAVING THEIR PARENTS DEPORTED. WE NEED TO PROVIDE LEGAL PROTECTION NOW FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND WE NEED A PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, AS ALL OF YOU WILL RECALL, THERE WAS A FIERCE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE UNITED STATES SHOULD GO TO WAR IN IRAQ. I LISTENED TO WHAT BUSH AND CHENEY AND DONALD RUMSFELD HAD TO SAY. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: AND I DID NOT BELIEVE THEM. I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ME HAPPY, IT TRULY DOES NOT, TO TELL YOU THAT MUCH OF WHAT I SAID DURING THAT DEBATE -- GO TO YOUTUBE AND LOOK AT WHAT I SAID -- SADLY, MUCH OF WHAT I FEARED WOULD HAPPEN DID HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE DESTABILIZATION OF THE REGION. AND NOW, AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS ANOTHER DEBATE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOW, I FIND IT ASTOUNDING THAT MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN HAVE DONE TO OUR PEOPLE AND TO OUR COUNTRY. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE 6700 BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO DIED. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE YOUNG MEN WHO CAME HOME WITHOUT LEGS AND ARMS. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE 500,000 WHO CAME HOME WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER OR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND, BY THE WAY, IF THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR ANYTHING, WE HAVE TO STAND WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME HOME FROM WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: BUT NOW, THE DEBATE IS OVER IRAN AND WHETHER OR NOT CONGRESS SHOULD APPROVE THE AGREEMENT WORKED ON BY THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY KERRY. WELL, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A PERFECT AGREEMENT. THE UNITED STATES HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH FIVE OTHER COUNTRIES. PLUS GERMANY, PLUS IRAN. BUT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON WITHOUT GOING TO WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IT REALLY, REALLY DOES TROUBLE ME HOW QUICKLY, HOW EASILY IN A SENSE -- PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T WANT THIS AGREEMENT, WE DON'T TRUST IRAN. WE DON'T LIKE IRAN. WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING IS YES, WE WILL GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAN. NOW, A GREAT NATION IS A NATION THAT DOES EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO CULTIVATE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT AND CRAZY WORLD -- NOBODY HAS ANY ANSWERS TO ALL OF THE CRAZINESS IN THIS WORLD. ISIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT, WE SHOULD BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD IN TRYING TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT IN A PEACEFUL WAY AND NOT IN ANOTHER WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TONIGHT IN THIS RATHER HOT ROOM. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING TWO THINGS. FIRST, THIS CAMPAIGN, HONESTLY, IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. I CANNOT DO IT ALONE. WE NEED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO REACH OUT TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY DO NOT CONTINUE TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERESTS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THE SECOND AND LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE, I WANT YOU ALL NOT TO THINK SMALL. I WANT YOU TO THINK BIG. THIS IS THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY, IF WE WERE A HAITI OR SMALL COUNTRY, IT IS TOO BAD WE CANNOT DO THIS. THAT IS NOT AMERICA. WE CAN JOIN THE REST OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD AND GUARANTY HEALTH CARE AS A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN HAVE THE BEST CHILDCARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD, NOT A DYSFUNCTIONAL ONE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN JOIN OTHER COUNTRIES AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF INCOME, CAN GET A HIGHER EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT EVERY SENIOR IN OUR COUNTRY CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY AND SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN : THAT A VETERAN THAT HIS OR HER LIFE TO DEFEND US GETS THE QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND BENEFITS THEY HAVE EARNED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO AMERICAN, REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, THEIR RELIGION, THEIR DISABILITY, OR THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS REALIZE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE QUALITY THAT IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT AS AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS A NATION, IF WE DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO DIVIDE US UP BY RACE OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR THE COUNTRY WE CAME FROM, THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING THAT TOGETHER WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) KEEP ON ROCKING IN THE FREE WORLD (music) (music) KEEP ON ROCKING IN THE FREE WORLD (music) (music) WE HAVE A THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT WE HAVE A KINDER, GENTLER MACHINE GUN HAND (music) >> BERNIE, SAY HI TO MY SISTER FOR ME. >> THANK YOU, BERNIE. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327833-1/senator-marco-rubio-rfl-us-policy-toward-china,Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) on U.S. Policy Toward China,Marco Rubio,"2, TELEVISION FOR SERIOUS READERS. >> BERNIE SANDERS SPOKE TO SUPPORTERS AT A RALLY IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, FOLLOWING HIS REMARKS, HE ALSO TOOK SOME QUESTIONS FROM VIEWERS. THIS IS JUST UNDER TWO HOURS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE LAST STOP OF THE EVENING. WE ARE EXCITED TO BE IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY FOR BERNIE 2016. I WILL BE YOUR MC FOR THIS EVENING. BEFORE I BRING OUT THE MAN OF THE HOUR, I WANT TO CHAT WITH YOU ALL. DID YOU KNOW, AMERICA CELEBRATED THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS MOMENT, LANDMARK LEGISLATION. AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. BUT THE SUPREME COURT 2013 DECISION GETTING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS A SHAMEFUL STEP BACKWARDS. IT WAS. TODAY WE KNOW OUR VOTING RIGHTS, FAMILY VALUES, THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND A BLACK LIVES ARE UNDER ATTACK. WE KNOW WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. WE NEED PEOPLE WE TRUST AT LEADING THIS COUNTRY TO GET THE WORK DONE. AM I RIGHT? WE NEED NEW VOICES THAT ARE NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT THE INJUSTICES PLAGUING PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE PLIGHT OF EVERYDAY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE CRITICAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW WHICH PROTECTED VOTERS IN PLACES WITH A HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION IS AS NECESSARY TODAY AS IT WAS DURING THE JIM CROW ERA. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY ARE PARALLEL ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY. PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO REFORMING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO WE ARE NOT LOCKING UP ALL GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE. BUT WE ARE INSTEAD ENDING THE DISGRACE THAT IS THE MASS INCARCERATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE WHO TRULY BELIEVE AND ARE WORKING TO ENSURE EVERY SINGLE YOUNG PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY RECEIVES A SHOT AT A QUALITY AFFORDABLE EDUCATION. PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE SANDERS. IF YOU BELIEVE LIKE I DO THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS THE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO. YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST VERY IMPORTANT STEP UP BY ATTENDING THIS TOWN HALL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [APPLAUSE] >> THIS PASSION YOU FEEL, THIS BURN, WE WANT YOU TO VISIT OUR WEBSITE. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. DONATE TO THE CAMPAIGN. THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO TO GET INVOLVED IS YOU CAN TEXT TO BERNIE TO 82623. THAT WILL GIVE YOU REAL TIME UPDATES. THE LAST THING YOU CAN DO IS FOLLOW US ON TWITTER. @BERNIESANDERS ON TWITTER. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SPREADING THIS MESSAGE, THIS MULTIRACIAL REVOLUTION, THIS FIGHT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE. ECONOMIC JUSTICE. RACIAL JUSTICE. ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] >> AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IT IS MY PLEASURE AND HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, UNITED STATES SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. [APPLAUSE] (music) [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THANK YOU. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE COULD SQUEEZE TOO MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. AND LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE OVERFLOW ROOM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT 3.5 MONTHS AGO. WHEN WE BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE WERE SAYING BERNIE SANDERS, INTERESTING GUY BUT KIND OF A FRINGE TYPE CANDIDATE. I MEAN NO ONE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY THE IDEA THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, WE NEED A POLITICAL REVOLUTION IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN ALMOST ALL OF THE NEW INCOME IS GOING TO THE TOP 1%. [APPLAUSE] MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY AND MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STARTED COMING OUT. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WE WERE ON THE WEST COAST AND WE HAD 15,000 PEOPLE IN SEATTLE. 28,000 PEOPLE IN PORTLAND, OREGON. AND WE HAD 27,000 PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES. IT SEEMS TO ME THE IDEAS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT FRINGE IDEAS, THEY ARE THE IDEAS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A CAMPAIGN ON THE MOVE. THIS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT IS GOING TO WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT THE ENTHUSIASM AND THE EXCITEMENT FOR THIS CAMPAIGN HASN'T JUST LAUNCHED TURNOUTS. PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES CONTROL OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. I DO NOT REPRESENT THE BILLIONAIRES' AGENDA. I DO NOT WANT THEIR MONEY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY SUPERPAC AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE ARE RAISING MONEY FOR THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM 400,000 AMERICANS. AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION, $31. I'M PROUD OF THAT. WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT IS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE DO NOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE DIVIDED, IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS BLACK AND WHITE AND HISPANIC, NATIVE AMERICAN, MEN AND WOMEN, STRAIGHT AND GAY, NATIVEBORN AND IMMIGRANT -- [APPLAUSE] IF WE STAND TOGETHER, THEY MAY HAVE ALL THE POWER. BUT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE. WHEN PEOPLE STAND TOGETHER, WE WIN. WHERE EVER I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY, MEDIA COME UP TO ME AND SAY, WE ARE SURPRISED, WHY IS THERE SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM? WHY ARE YOU MOVING UP IN THE POLLS? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT MY ANSWER IS TO THEM. MY ANSWER IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED WITH ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED WITH ESTABLISHMENT ECONOMICS. AND FRANKLY, THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA. [APPLAUSE] THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT CORPORATE GREED, THIS NEVER ENDING GREED OF NEEDING MORE AND MORE NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY HAVE, THAT CORPORATE GREED IS DESTROYING OUR ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND, AND I SPEAK HERE AS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE VETERANS COMMITTEE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT MEN AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND SOMETIMES LOST THEIR LIVES DEFENDING DEMOCRACY AND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN BILLIONAIRES ARE BUYING ELECTIONS. THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AT A TIME WHEN THIS COUNTRY FACES SO MANY ENORMOUS PROBLEMS, WHEN WE NEED SERIOUS DISCUSSION, THAT MUCH OF THE CORPORATE MEDIA WILL TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING WORKING AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN BE. THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS OR HILLARY CLINTON. IT IS NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, JEB BUSH OR ANYONE ELSE. IT IS ABOUT YOU, YOUR KIDS, YOUR PARENTS, AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] >> BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE. MR. SANDERS: AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RUN FOR OFFICE A NUMBER OF TIMES IN VERMONT, I HAVE NEVER RUN A NEGATIVE POLITICAL AD IN MY LIFE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WHAT POLITICS AND A DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT IS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY AND PROPOSE IDEAS AND LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DISCUSS THEM. I THINK IT IS ABSURD FOR POLITICIANS TO SAY, I AM GREAT, I AM WONDERFUL, EVERYONE ELSE IS TERRIBLE. THAT IS WRONG. WHAT WE NEED IS A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: OUR CAMPAIGN IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CAMPAIGNS, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE FACT THAT IT WE HAVE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE VISION, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN HOW WE ARE RUNNING THIS CAMPAIGN. I BELIEVE, AND LET ME BE HONEST WITH YOU AND TELL YOU WHAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WILL TELL YOU, THAT NO MATTER WHO IS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NO MATTER HOW GOOD HE OR SHE MAY BE, THAT PERSON CANNOT ADDRESS THE ENORMOUS PROBLEMS FACING WORKING FAMILIES AND THE MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF BIG MONEY INTERESTS IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE TRUTH AND IT IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH. WHAT I AM CALLING FOR IS NOT JUST YOUR SUPPORT TO ELECT TO ME AS PRESIDENT, I'M ASKING YOU TO BE PART OF A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. [APPLAUSE] A REVOLUTION WHICH TRANSFORMS OUR COUNTRY ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY, SOCIALLY, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS ABOUT IS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM COAST TO COAST, STANDING UP AND SAYING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THIS GREAT NATION AND OUR GOVERNMENT BELONG TO ALL OF US, NOT JUST TO A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS, THE SAD TRUTH, THE TRUTH IS OUR COUNTRY FACES MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND IF YOU THROW IN THE GLOBAL CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE PROBLEMS MAY BE WORSE TODAY. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS UNLESS WE ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY. I STARTED WITH THE ISSUE OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. TODAY, AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. MOST AMERICANS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, DON'T PERCEIVE THAT, DON'T FEEL THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BUSY WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS WHILE THE REST ARE GOING TO THE TOP 1%. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE TRUTH IS THE UNITED STATES TODAY HAS MORE INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION ON EARTH. THE INEQUALITY TODAY IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT IS WORSE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE 1928. SO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE GETTING RICHER AND RICHER. EVERYBODY ELSE IS BECOMING POORER AND POORER. THE TRUTH IS NO GREAT NATION CAN SURVIVE ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY WHEN SO FEW HAVE SO MUCH AND SO MANY HAVE SO LITTLE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG AND PROFOUNDLY IMMORAL. BY THE WAY, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE START INJECTING MORALITY INTO OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. NOT 1%, 1/10 OF 1% OWNS ALMOST AS MUCH[,] AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A PROLIFERATION OF MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES BUT ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. WE END UP WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH. THERE IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY WRONG WHEN ONE FAMILY, ONE FAMILY, THIS IS AMERICA NOT PARAGUAY, NOT SOME SMALL THIRD WORLD COUNTRY, WHEN ONE FAMILY, THE WALTON FAMILY OF WALMART, OWNS MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 40% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. WHEN PEOPLE ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS, TRYING TO GET SOME INCOME AND HEALTH CARE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. WHEN THAT IS GOING ON, WELL, A HANDFULL OF BILLIONAIRES ARE MAKING OUT LIKE BANDITS. THIS IS A RIGGED ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: TOGETHER, YOU AND I AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES, NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. [APPLAUSE] THIS CAMPAIGN IS SENDING A SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD MESSAGE TO THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS. THAT IS YOU CANNOT, YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT ALL. [APPLAUSE] THE CEOS OF LARGE CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRE CLASS ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET HUGE TAX BREAKS WHEN CHILDREN IN AMERICA GO HUNGRY. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEND OUR JOBS TO CHINA AND OTHER LOW-WAGE COUNTRIES WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF WORK RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: CORPORATE AMERICA AND THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS ARE NOT GOING TO HIDE THEIR MANY BILLIONS IN PROFITS BY PUTTING THEM IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND OTHER TAX HAVENS. THEY ARE GOING TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. [APPLAUSE] WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT, THEIR GREED IS GOING TO END BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO END IT FOR THEM. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY, LET ME BRING IT ON HOME TO WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE WEALTHIEST 14 PEOPLE IN AMERICA, 14 PEOPLE, SAW THEIR WEALTH INCREASE BY $156 BILLION. HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHILE 14 PEOPLE SAW AN UNBELIEVABLE INCREASE IN THEIR WEALTH, 27% OF THE CHILDREN HERE ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. ALMOST 300,000 CHILDREN. 14 PEOPLE INCREASED WEALTH $156 BILLION. 27% OF THE KIDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA LIVING IN POVERTY. OF THOSE CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY, 138,000 ARE BLACK, 95,000 ARE WHITE AND 34,000 ARE HISPANIC. CHILDHOOD POVERTY IMPACTS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE REALITY. LET'S LAY IT ON THE TABLE. BILLIONAIRES BECOME RICHER WHILE CHILDREN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND ALL OVER AMERICA LACK ADEQUATE NUTRITION. IN THE YEAR 2015 IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IN VERMONT AND THROUGHOUT AMERICA, CHILDREN ARE GOING HUNGRY. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT BILLIONAIRES BECOME RICHER WHEN KIDS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE STARVING. [APPLAUSE] IF WE ARE A MORAL PEOPLE, WE GIVE THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. TO TURN OUR BACKS ON THE CHILDREN WHILE BILLIONAIRES GET RICHER IS NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BASIC NEEDS, LET US NOT FORGET THAT WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] NOW I LIVE IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT, AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE CANADIAN BORDER. THE CANADIANS GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO EVERY PEOPLE. IN THE U.K., THEY GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE. GERMANY, FRANCE, SCANDINAVIA DOES IT. EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY DOES IT ACCEPT US AND THAT IS WHY I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN A MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE IN SINGLE PAYMENT BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS BELIEVES IN, BUT THE CONGRESS DID PASS, AND THE PRESIDENT DID FIND, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. BY EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS NOW HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHO PREVIOUSLY LACKED IT. THAT IS A GOOD THING. [APPLAUSE] THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS CUT ARKANSAS' UNINSURED POPULATION ALMOST IN HALF. IT HAS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN KENTUCKY FROM 20% TO 12%. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IN SOUTH CAROLINA, OVER 200,000 PEOPLE WOULD GAIN HEALTH INSURANCE IF THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE EXPANSION. [APPLAUSE] NOT ONLY WOULD SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE GAIN HEALTH INSURANCE, THE STATE WOULD CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PICKS UP ALMOST ALL OF THE BILL. PRETTY GOOD DEAL. [APPLAUSE] IN MY VIEW, IT IS TERRIBLY WRONG TO ALLOW A RIGID, RIGHT-WING, POLITICAL IDEOLOGY TO STAND IN THE WAY OF HEALTH CARE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOUTH CAROLINIANS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WRONG TO ALLOW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL STATE TO DIE UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GO TO A DOCTOR WHEN THEY SHOULD. IT IS WRONG AND IMMORAL TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE WILL SUFFER AND BECOME MUCH SICKER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE MEDICAID. THAT IS WRONG. [APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD HOPE VERY MUCH THAT NOT ONLY HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES WOULD LET GO FOR ONE MINUTE OF THE RIGHT WING IDEOLOGY AND TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATE. [APPLAUSE] I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE LEGISLATURES AND GOVERNORS HATE PRESIDENT OBAMA. YOU CAN HATE PRESIDENT OBAMA, BUT DO NOT HATE THE KIDS AND THE WORKING FAMILIES IN YOUR STATE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT JUST THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME INEQUALITY. IT IS THE REALITIES THAT FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS OF OUR COUNTRY, ONCE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD, HAS BEEN DISAPPEARING. THE TRUTH IS WE ARE MUCH BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEFT OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] LET US NOT FORGET THAT WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE, WE WERE HEMORRHAGING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE AND WE WERE RUNNING UP A $1.4 TRILLION DEFICIT. I FIND IT INTERESTING REPUBLICANS COMPLAIN THEY ARE ONLY GROWING 250,000 JOBS A MONTH. THAT IS A LOT BETTER THAN LOSING 800,000 JOBS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: HERE IS THE POINT -- YES, WE ARE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN BUSH LEFT OFFICE, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TODAY ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. ALL OF YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION IN TECHNOLOGY MAKING WORKERS FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN THEY USED TO BE. AND YET, MANY OF THOSE WORKERS HAVE SEEN THEIR REAL WAGES GO DOWN. SINCE 1999, MEDIUM FAMILY INCOME TODAY IS ALMOST $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS IN 1999. THAT IS OUR REALITY. WE ARE BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE 6.5 YEARS AGO BUT WE CONTINUE TO FIND AND SEE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR MIDDLE-CLASS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS COME UP WITH PROPOSAL AFTER PROPOSAL THAT REBUILDS THE CRUMBLING MIDDLE-CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU. EVERY MONTH, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COMES OUT WITH THINGS. UNEMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA IS 5.3%. WRONG. THAT OFFICIAL STATISTIC DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR WORK AND THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING PART-TIME. ADD THAT ALTOGETHER, REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS OVER 10%. THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE MUST DEAL WITH. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PUSH UNDER THE RUG. I ASKED THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE TO DO A STUDY ON YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IN THIS COUNTRY? IN TERMS OF KID TO HAVE NO JOBS, OR ARE WORKING PART-TIME WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME, WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THE KIDS 17 TO 20 WHO GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY WERE WHITE, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 33%. IF THEY WERE HISPANIC, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 36%. IF THEY WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS 51%. [BOOING] WE ARE TURNING OUR BACKS ON AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAND ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET. [APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. ONE OF THE GREAT SHAMES IN OUR COUNTRY, ONE OF THE GREAT INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT IS WE AS A NATION HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] CHINA, A NATION THREE TIMES LARGER THAN US, A COMMUNIST, AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRY HAS FEWER PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN WE DO. IF ANYBODY HERE THINKS THERE IS NOT A CONNECTION BETWEEN HUGE RATES OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND KIDS THAT END UP IN JAIL, YOU WOULD BE VERY MISTAKEN. RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, IN MY STATE, YOUR STATE, WE ARE 5.5 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL, WHO ARE NOT WORKING, WHO ARE HANGING OUT IN STREET CORNERS AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE. IN MY VIEW, IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE FOR US TO BE INVESTING IN EDUCATION AND IN JOBS. [APPLAUSE] IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO BE INVESTING IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAN IN JAILS AND INCARCERATION. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, IT IS NOT JUST INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY AND IT IS NOT JUST HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. IT IS THE SIMPLE FACT THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT MILLIONS OF OUR PEOPLE ARE WORKING AT WAGES THAT ARE TOO DAMN LOW. [APPLAUSE] THE CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF $7.25 AN HOUR, $7.25 AN HOUR -- [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: -- IS A STARVATION WAGE. OUR JOB IS TO RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO A LIVING WAGE -- $15 AN HOUR OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA TO SAY THAT IF SOMEBODY WORKS 40 HOURS A WEEK, THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE LIVING IN POVERTY. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS IN WAGES, I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM WILL STAND WITH THE WOMEN AND PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE TOO MANY WOMEN IN AMERICA TRYING TO BRING UP THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE MAKING $.78 ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO MEN. PAY EQUITY WILL TAKE A HUGE CHUNK OUT OF POVERTY IN AMERICA AND WE MUST FIGHT TO ESTABLISH PAY EQUITY. [APPLAUSE] I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES RUN AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. THEY JUST LOVE FAMILIES. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS WOMEN IN AMERICA SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES. I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IN THEIR CONCEPT OF FAMILY VALUES IS THAT WOMEN ARE TOO DUMB TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE CONTRACEPTIVE THEY NEED. I DISAGREE. WHAT THEY ARE ALSO SAYING IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF FAMILY VALUES IS THAT ARE GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED AND ENJOY ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. I DISAGREE. [APPLAUSE] I AM VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE FOUR KIDS, SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN. JANE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 27 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE, WE BELIEVE IN FAMILY AND WE BELIEVE IN STRONGLY PROTECTING THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES, BUT MY FAMILY VALUES ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN REPUBLICAN FAMILY VALUES. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES, I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST END THE INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT OF BEING THE ONLY, ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE WORKERS PAID MEDICAL AND FAMILY LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN A WOMAN HAS A BABY TODAY, IF SHE HAS THE INCOME AND THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT, SHE CAN STAY HOME AND GET TO LOVE HER BABY, BOND WITH HER BABY. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE PARENTS, IT IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCES OF BEING HUMAN. [APPLAUSE] IT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT FOR THE BABY AS WELL. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS A FAMILY VALUE. IT IS A FAMILY VALUE WHEN MOM STAYS HOME, NOURISHES THE BABY, GETS TO KNOW HER BABY AND DAD IS THERE AS WELL. IT IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE TO TELL THAT MOM THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR BABY AND GO BACK TO WORK IN FIVE DAYS OR EIGHT DAYS. THAT IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE SUPPORTED AND WILL FIGHT FOR LEGISLATION THAT GUARANTEES EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY OR MEDICAL LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A FAMILY VALUE. IF EVERY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH COULD DO IT, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA COULD DO IT, TOO. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE REMAIN THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE SICK TIME TO OUR WORKERS OR PAID VACATION. THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE, TOO. [APPLAUSE] WITH REAL UNEMPLOYMENT OVER 10%, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT, WE NEED ON MAJOR FEDERAL JOBS PROGRAM TO PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] AT A TIME WHEN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING, OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR WATER SYSTEMS, WASTE WATER PLANTS, AIRPORTS, LEVIES, DAMS -- THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH WORK TO DO. A $1 TRILLION INVESTMENT OVER FIVE YEARS COULD CREATE OVER 13 MILLION DECENT PAYING JOBS. [APPLAUSE] BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- IT IS NOT ONLY THE ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE OF HAVING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, IT IS ALSO THE ABSOLUTE NEED TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF MORE JOBS BECAUSE OF OUR DISASTROUS TRADE POLICIES. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SENATOR AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE WHO VOTED AGAINST NAFTA, CAPFA, AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SENATOR WHO WILL HELP LEAD THE EFFORT AGAINST THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED, WE NEED TRADE POLICIES WHICH CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA, NOT IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WHEN WE USE WORDS LIKE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS AND ARROGANCE AND DISHONESTY, WE ONLY HAVE SOME OF THE ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE WALL STREET. ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT AS A RESULT OF THE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS OF WALL STREET, OUR ECONOMY WAS BROUGHT TO ITS KNEES, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS, THEIR HOUSES AND THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. TODAY, AFTER BAILING OUT WALL STREET BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BIG TO FAIL, THREE OUT OF THE FOUR LARGEST BANKS ARE BIGGER NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE WE BAILED THEM OUT. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: IN MY VIEW -- LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS -- WHEN YOU HAVE SIX BANKS ISSUING TWO THIRDS OF THE CREDIT CARDS IN THIS COUNTRY, 35% OF THE MORTGAGES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHEN YOU HAVE BANKS THAT ARE TOO BIG TO FAIL, THEY ARE TOO BIG TO EXIST. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED A FINANCIAL SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES AFFORDABLE LOANS TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN CREATE THE JOBS WE NEED. WE DO NOT NEED A FINANCIAL SYSTEM ON WALL STREET WHICH IS AN ISLAND UNTO ITSELF WHICH IS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT PROFITS FOR A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] I AM OFTEN ASKED, WELL, BERNIE, WHICH OF THE ISSUES OUT THERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER BECAUSE ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. HERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT IMPACTS EVERY OTHER ISSUE AND THAT IS FIVE YEARS AGO, AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE SUPREME COURT BY A 5-4 DECISION IN THE CITIZENS UNITED -- [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: IN THE CITIZENS UNITED CASE, WHAT THEY SAID TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, THEY SAID YOU GUYS ALREADY OWN MUCH OF THE ECONOMY. WE ARE NOW GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO OWN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE ONE FAMILY, THE EXTREME RIGHT WING KOCH BROTHERS. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: THE SECOND WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN AMERICA IS PREPARED TO SPEND $900 MILLION IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE. THAT IS MORE MONEY THAN EITHER PARTY WILL SPEND. WHEN YOU HAVE ONE FAMILY SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN EITHER OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. THAT IS OLIGARCHY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE NOT MADE MANY CAMPAIGN PROMISES, BUT THIS IS ONE I HAVE MADE AND WILL NOMINEE OF MINE TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WILL GET THAT POSITION UNLESS HE OR SHE IS LOUD AND CLEAR IN SAYING THAT ONE OF THEIR FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS WILL IN FACT BE RE-HEAR ING AND TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I AM A PASSIONATE BELIEVER IN DEMOCRACY. I REALLY BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. AND WHAT THAT MEANS, WHAT THAT VERY RADICAL IDEA MEANS -- ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YEARS OLD -- WHAT THAT IDEA MEANS IS THAT YOU AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, POOR PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE, ANYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE AND SHAPE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND NOT JUST A KING OR QUEEN OR A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. THAT IS A RADICAL IDEA THAT I BELIEVE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IN MY VIEW, NOT ONLY MUST WE OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED, WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER. I WANT TO SEE THIS COUNTRY HAVE THE MOST VIBRANT DEMOCRACY OF ANY COUNTRY ON EARTH. I WANT TO SEE US HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUTS, NOT ONE OF THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUTS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I WANT TO SEE A PROCESS IN WHICH ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM, ANYBODY IN AMERICA WHETHER YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE, PROGRESSIVE, MODERATE -- IF YOU BELIEVE YOU WANT TO GET INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR IDEAS, I WANT TO SEE YOU BE ABLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE WITHOUT BEGGING MONEY FROM THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN WASHINGTON, I WAS AT AN EVENT WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING, III AND PEOPLE WITH THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONGRESS. A VERY GOOD CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. AND WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THAT MEETING WAS TO, FIRST OF ALL, CELEBRATE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY -- AND SOMEONE MENTIONED THIS EARLIER. OF THE ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS ACT. OK? [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHAT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS ABOUT WAS TO SAY THE GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, MANY IN THE SOUTH, WILL SAY SORRY, ALL PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THAT WAS A GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR DEMOCRACY, BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO, THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED A VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST TO THE SOUTH, BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE, TO DENY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE, THOSE PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH THE POWERS THAT BE. AND THEY ARE UNSAFE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: YOU KNOW, I TAKE THAT KIND OF PERSONALLY AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. I HAVE RUN FOR OFFICE IN MY OWN STATE MANY TIMES. SOMETIMES I HAVE LOST. MOST TIMES I HAVE WON. BUT IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME, NEVER, NOT FOR ONE SECOND TO SAY THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT SYMPATHETIC TO ME, HOW DO I FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STOP THOSE PEOPLE FROM VOTING? IF YOU CANNOT RUN FOR OFFICE AND DEFEND YOUR IDEAS, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT RUN FOR OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: PEOPLE, LEGISLATURES, GOVERNORS WHO TRY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM VOTING BECAUSE THEY MAY VOTE AGAINST A GOVERNOR OR THE LEGISLATURES ARE NOTHING LESS THAN POLITICAL COWARDS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION WHICH MORE OR LESS SAYS THAT IF YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YOU ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, END OF DISCUSSION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN IS A VERY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AND IF OUR NATION IS GOING TO SUCCEED ECONOMICALLY, WE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WHAT SADDENS ME VERY MUCH IS AS WE SPEAK HERE TONIGHT, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT, YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY -- KIDS WHO HAVE DONE REALLY WELL IN SCHOOL. KIDS WERE QUALIFIED TO GET INTO COLLEGE, BUT THEY CANNOT GET INTO COLLEGE FOR ONE REASON -- THEIR FAMILIES LACK THE MONEY. TO MY MIND, IT IS NOT ONLY UNFAIR TO THESE KIDS TO DENY THEM THE RIGHT TO BECOME DOCTORS OR ENGINEERS OR TEACHERS OR SCIENTISTS OR WHATEVER ELSE -- NOT ONLY UNFAIR TO THEM, BUT IT IS ABSURD WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. WE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED WORKERS IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION WHICH DOES TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS. FIRST, IT SAYS THAT EVERY PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA WILL BE TUITION-FREE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY THIS IDEA, THIS SIMPLE IDEA IS A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA. IT IS NOT JUST THAT IT WILL MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO GET TO COLLEGE. IT WILL CERTAINLY DO THAT. BUT THIS IS WHAT ELSE IT WILL DO -- TODAY IN COLUMBIA, IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT, THERE ARE KIDS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADES. THESE ARE KIDS WHOSE MOM AND DAD DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE. THESE ARE KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO WENT TO COLLEGE AND THE IDEA OF GOING TO COLLEGE, OF MAKING IT INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS IS SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR WILDEST EXPECTATIONS OR DREAMS. BUT, IF WE TELL EVERY KID IN COLUMBIA AND IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT THAT IF YOU STUDY, IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO SCHOOL, IF YOU DO YOUR WORK, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IT WILL IMPACT KIDS FROM THE FIRST GRADE ON UP. AND THE SECOND THING WE HAVE DONE IN A LEGISLATION IS TO ADDRESS THE ABSURDITY OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, SOME YOUNG, SOME NOT SO YOUNG, WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HORRENDOUSLY OPPRESSIVE STUDENT DEBT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I HAVE TALKED TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE CRIME IN LIFE WAS SHE WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND IS PRACTICING PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FOR LOW-INCOME PEOPLE. EXACTLY THE KIND OF DOCTORS WE NEED. BUT, FOR DOING THAT, SHE CAME OUT OF SCHOOL $300,000 IN DEBT. I WAS IN IOWA A FEW MONTHS AGO. A YOUNG WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE GRADUATED DENTAL SCHOOL -- $400,000 IN DEBT AT A TIME WHERE WE HAVE A MAJOR DENTAL CRISIS AND WE NEED MORE DENTISTS. I TALKED TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING OFF 25% OF THEIR LIMITED INCOMES IN STUDENT DEBT. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET MARRIED. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET A CAR. CANNOT AFFORD TO GET A HOME. NOW, IN MY VIEW, IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL THAT IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME TODAY AT 2% OR 3% OR 4%, YOU SHOULD NOT BE PAYING 8% OR 10% ON YOUR STUDENT DEBT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THIRD OF ALL, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH HOLDS MOST OF THAT DEBT SHOULD NOT BE PROFITEERING WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES OF WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: PEOPLE SAY TO ME, WELL, BERNIE, THAT IS A GOOD IDEA, BUT IT WILL BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION-FREE AND LOWER STUDENT DEBT. HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR IT? LET ME TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW I WILL PAY FOR IT -- WITH A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WALL STREET DESTROYED THIS ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THEIR GREED AND RECKLESSNESS, THEY WENT BEGGING TO THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BAIL THEM OUT. NOW IT IS WALL STREET'S TIME TO BAIL OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS HUMAN BEINGS, AS PARENTS, ADULTS, THERE IS PERHAPS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN LEAVING THIS PLANET IN A WAY THAT IS HABITABLE FOR OUR KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE DEBATE IS OVER. THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN A VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUS VOICE HAVE TOLD US CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY. AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY TODAY CAUSING DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHAT THE SCIENTISTS TELL US -- IF WE DO NOT GET OUR ACT TOGETHER IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, A BAD SITUATION TODAY WILL BECOME MUCH, MUCH WORSE WITH THE PLANET TEMPERATURE RISING 5 OR 10 DEGREES MORE FAHRENHEIT. MORE DROUGHT, MORE FLOOD, MORE EXTREME WEATHER DISTURBANCES. MORE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. THE UNITED STATES HAS THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD THE WORLD IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT VALUES AND PRIORITIES. I AM THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHICH MEANS I AM THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATS IN OUR POSITION. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW. THE MEDIA FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] MR. SANDERS: THAT IS THE BUDGET PASSED BY THE REPUBLICANS A FEW MONTHS AGO DOES THE FOLLOWING -- IT THROWS 27 MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF HEALTH CARE. IT CUTS PELL GRANTS BY $90 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. IT CUTS NUTRITION PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE WIC PROGRAM, FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR LITTLE KIDS BY BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: THOSE ARE THE PRIORITIES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THOSE ARE NOT AMERICA'S PRIORITIES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, NOT ONLY ARE THEY MAKING MASSIVE CUTS IN HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND OTHER VITALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS, THEIR BUDGET PROPOSES TO GIVE $250 BILLION IN TAX BREAKS TO THE TOP 2/10 OF 1%. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: SO, LET ME TELL MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES -- NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CUT VETERANS PROGRAMS. WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND VETERANS PROGRAMS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO OUR VETERANS, WHO HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MAKING OUR COUNTRY THE KIND OF NATION THAT IT MUST BECOME, WE MUST TALK ABOUT ENDING INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND MAKING MAJOR REFORMS -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND MAKING MAJOR REFORMS TO OUR BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN OVERCOMING OUR LONG LEGACY OF RACISM. WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. IF PEOPLE WERE SITTING IN THIS ROOM 30 YEARS AGO AND SOMEBODY SAID I THINK IN THE YEAR 2008, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN COULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT, THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL LOOK AT HIS IDEAS, HIS VIEWS, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID NO. IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN THAT FAST, BUT IT DID HAPPEN AND WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AND THE STRUGGLE ABSOLUTELY CONTINUES AGAINST SEXISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND OPENING DOORS FOR WOMEN THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: GOD ONLY KNOWS THAT THAT STRUGGLE CONTINUES, BUT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN THE FIGHT FOR GAY RIGHTS. SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS AND WE AS AMERICANS DESERVE A PAT ON THE BACK FOR MAKING REAL PROGRESS IN MAKING US A LESS DISCRIMINATORY SOCIETY IN MANY RESPECTS. BUT, HERE IS THE BAD NEWS -- AS EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS, RACISM REMAINS A MUCH TOO REAL PART OF AMERICAN LIFE. AND IN THAT REGARD, I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SICKNESS OF A MAN WHO CAN WALK INTO A BIBLE STUDY CLASS IN CHARLESTON, PRAY WITH PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM AND THEN TAKE OUT A GUN AND KILL NINE OF THEM. THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY CAN DO THAT. AND WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT OTHER FORMS OF RACISM THAT WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF HATE GROUPS THAT EXIST ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, GROUPS THAT EXIST FOR ONE PURPOSE ALONE AND THAT IS -- IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE -- BUT TO FOMENT HATRED AGAINST AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR GAYS OR IMMIGRANTS OR JEWS -- PEOPLE THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEM. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THOSE GROUPS. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE MUCH MORE ACTIVE IN MAKING SURE -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THESE ARE THE TYPES OF GROUPS THAT EDUCATED THAT SICK MAN. BUT I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THOSE GROUPS. I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE SANDRA BLAND AND MICHAEL BROWN. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WALTER SCOTT AND FREDDIE GRAY AND MANY, MANY UNARMED AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO DIED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS OR IN POLICE CUSTODY. NOW, I WAS A MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND LET ME BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED VERY HARD WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT BEING A COP TODAY IS NOT AN EASY JOB AND MOST POLICE OFFICERS ARE HONEST AND TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME ALSO TELL YOU THAT AS IN THE CASE OF ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL, WHEN A POLICE OFFICER BREAKS THE LAW, THAT OFFICER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: FURTHER, WE NEED FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF A BROKEN, BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, BUT LET ME VERY BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE AREAS THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY IN. WHEN I TURN ON THE TV AND I SEE IN SOME CITIES, SMALL CITIES ALL OVER AMERICA, POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HEAVILY MILITARIZED, THAT LOOK LIKE AN INVADING ARMY, THAT IS WRONG. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: THE BEST POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN AMERICA ARE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHERE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH POLICE OFFICERS AND ARE ABLE TO SAY THERE IS A CRACK HOUSE DOWN THE STREET, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN A POLICE FORCE THAT IS WORKING WITH THEM, NOT AGAINST THEM. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF BURLINGTON, WE MOVED TOWARDS THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY POLICING -- MAKING POLICE OFFICERS PART OF THE COMMUNITY. WE ALSO -- POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE RUN BY COMMUNITIES BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A ROLE. POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA SHOULD REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE USE OF FORCE DOCTRINE THAT EXISTS IN MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS. GOOD POLICE OFFICERS -- I HAVE SEEN IT PERSONALLY MANY TIMES -- ARE ABLE TO DEFLECT A VOLATILE SITUATION. THAT IS GOOD POLICE WORK. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: MANY OFFICERS ARE TRAINED TO DO THAT. THAT IS TOUGH. I HAVE SEEN POLICE OFFICERS GET IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND LETHAL FORCE IS THE LAST RESORT, NOT THE FIRST. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED TO BEGIN RETHINKING THE WAR ON DRUGS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: I FIND IT REMARKABLE AND DISTURBING THAT MANY YOUNG AMERICANS HAVE RECEIVED A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR SMOKING OR POSSESSING MARIJUANA, BUT NOT ONE MAJOR WALL STREET EXECUTIVE HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR DESTROYING OUR ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN CONGRESS RECONVENES IN SEPTEMBER, I WILL BE OFFERING LEGISLATION WHICH ENDS THE ABSURDITY AND INJUSTICE OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS MAKING PROFITS BY BUILDING AND RUNNING JAILS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: CORPORATIONS SHOULD NOT BE MAKING A PROFIT ON THE INCARCERATION OF AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: FURTHER, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUBSTANCE ADDICTION, WHETHER IT IS DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER, IS A DISEASE. IS A DISEASE. IT IS A SERIOUS DISEASE THAT EXISTS IN MY STATE, IT EXISTS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. AND WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY TREAT THAT DISEASE AND NOT SEE IT AS A CRIME. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN DRUG COURTS AND MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IT IS A PRETTY CRAZY SITUATION WHEN MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN JAIL ARE MENTALLY ILL. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND I CAN TELL YOU I GET CALLS IN MY OFFICE, OTHER SENATORS GET CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM REALLY WORRIED ABOUT MY BROTHER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO TO HIMSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE, BUT WE CANNOT FIND A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING THAT WE NEED AND CAN AFFORD. THAT IS CRAZY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEVELOP A PATH BACK FROM PRISON. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOBODY SHOULD BE SHOCKED THAT IF SOMEBODY LEAVES PRISON WITHOUT A JOB, WITHOUT EDUCATION, WITHOUT DECENT HOUSING, THEY WILL GO BACK TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY GOT INTO JAIL IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE. BUT KEEP IN MIND, IT COSTS MORE MONEY TO KEEP SOMEBODY IN JAIL THAN TO SEND THEM -- [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BRINGING OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER, LET US NOT FORGET THAT TODAY THERE ARE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. I WAS IN PHOENIX A FEW WEEKS AGO TALKING TO A GROUP OF YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. TEARS ROLLING OUT OF THEIR EYES BECAUSE THEY WERE FEARFUL OF BEING DEPORTED OR HAVING THEIR PARENTS DEPORTED. WE NEED TO PROVIDE LEGAL PROTECTION NOW FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND WE NEED A PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, AS ALL OF YOU WILL RECALL, THERE WAS A FIERCE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE UNITED STATES SHOULD GO TO WAR IN IRAQ. I LISTENED TO WHAT BUSH AND CHENEY AND DONALD RUMSFELD HAD TO SAY. [BOOING] MR. SANDERS: AND I DID NOT BELIEVE THEM. I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ME HAPPY, IT TRULY DOES NOT, TO TELL YOU THAT MUCH OF WHAT I SAID DURING THAT DEBATE -- GO TO YOUTUBE AND LOOK AT WHAT I SAID -- SADLY, MUCH OF WHAT I FEARED WOULD HAPPEN DID HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE DESTABILIZATION OF THE REGION. AND NOW, AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS ANOTHER DEBATE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: NOW, I FIND IT ASTOUNDING THAT MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN HAVE DONE TO OUR PEOPLE AND TO OUR COUNTRY. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE 6700 BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO DIED. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE YOUNG MEN WHO CAME HOME WITHOUT LEGS AND ARMS. THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE 500,000 WHO CAME HOME WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER OR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND, BY THE WAY, IF THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR ANYTHING, WE HAVE TO STAND WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME HOME FROM WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: BUT NOW, THE DEBATE IS OVER IRAN AND WHETHER OR NOT CONGRESS SHOULD APPROVE THE AGREEMENT WORKED ON BY THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY KERRY. WELL, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A PERFECT AGREEMENT. THE UNITED STATES HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH FIVE OTHER COUNTRIES. PLUS GERMANY, PLUS IRAN. BUT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON WITHOUT GOING TO WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND IT REALLY, REALLY DOES TROUBLE ME HOW QUICKLY, HOW EASILY IN A SENSE -- PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T WANT THIS AGREEMENT, WE DON'T TRUST IRAN. WE DON'T LIKE IRAN. WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING IS YES, WE WILL GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAN. NOW, A GREAT NATION IS A NATION THAT DOES EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO CULTIVATE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT AND CRAZY WORLD -- NOBODY HAS ANY ANSWERS TO ALL OF THE CRAZINESS IN THIS WORLD. ISIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT, WE SHOULD BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD IN TRYING TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT IN A PEACEFUL WAY AND NOT IN ANOTHER WAR. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TONIGHT IN THIS RATHER HOT ROOM. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING TWO THINGS. FIRST, THIS CAMPAIGN, HONESTLY, IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. I CANNOT DO IT ALONE. WE NEED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO REACH OUT TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY DO NOT CONTINUE TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERESTS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND THE SECOND AND LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE, I WANT YOU ALL NOT TO THINK SMALL. I WANT YOU TO THINK BIG. THIS IS THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY, IF WE WERE A HAITI OR SMALL COUNTRY, IT IS TOO BAD WE CANNOT DO THIS. THAT IS NOT AMERICA. WE CAN JOIN THE REST OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD AND GUARANTY HEALTH CARE AS A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN HAVE THE BEST CHILDCARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD, NOT A DYSFUNCTIONAL ONE. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN JOIN OTHER COUNTRIES AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF INCOME, CAN GET A HIGHER EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT EVERY SENIOR IN OUR COUNTRY CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY AND SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN : THAT A VETERAN THAT HIS OR HER LIFE TO DEFEND US GETS THE QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND BENEFITS THEY HAVE EARNED. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: AND WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO AMERICAN, REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, THEIR RELIGION, THEIR DISABILITY, OR THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS REALIZE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE QUALITY THAT IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT AS AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] MR. SANDERS: IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS A NATION, IF WE DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO DIVIDE US UP BY RACE OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR THE COUNTRY WE CAME FROM, THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING THAT TOGETHER WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) KEEP ON ROCKING IN THE FREE WORLD (music) (music) KEEP ON ROCKING IN THE FREE WORLD (music) (music) WE HAVE A THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT WE HAVE A KINDER, GENTLER MACHINE GUN HAND (music) >> BERNIE, SAY HI TO MY SISTER FOR ME. >> THANK YOU, BERNIE. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?327704-1/senator-marco-rubio-rfl-economic-policy-address,Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) Economic Policy Address,Marco Rubio,"PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, MARCO RUBIO LAID OUT HIS ECONOMIC PRIORITIES AT A SPEECH AT THE DETROIT ECONOMIC CLUB. HE CALLED FOR DECREASING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 25%, AND INCREASING THE CURRENT CHILD TAX CREDIT. THIS IS 45 MINUTES. MR. RUBIO: THANK YOU. WHERE'S MY WATER HERE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM ON IT TO BE HERE. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE AT THE DETROIT ECONOMIC CLUB. I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER PLACE TO DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR NATION. I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER PLACE THAN TO TRY TO DO IT. I DON'T THINK ANY CITY UNDERSTANDS THE VISION BETTER THAN DETROIT. NO CITY UNDERSTANDS THE HEIGHT OF ATTAINABLE THROUGH THE AMERICAN DREAM BETTER THAN DETROIT. THE CITY UNDERSTANDS THE PAIN OF LOSING THE DREAM AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RESTORING IT BETTER THAN DETROIT. THAT'S WHY THIS CITY, TRULY THE HEART OF THE OLD ECONOMY, IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN EMBRACE A NEW AMERICAN ECONOMY, ONE EVEN GRANDER AND RICHER IN OPPORTUNITY AND CHANCES THAN EVER BEFORE. SO LET'S BEGIN BY LOOKING BACK TO THE YEAR 1896, WHEN IN A SMALL WORKSHOP ON THE MAC AVENUE WHICH IS LESS THAN 10 MILES FROM HERE. A MAN CONSTRUCTED ""WHILE OF SCRAP IRON. SEVEN YEARS LATER, THIS MAN HENRY FORD FOUNDED THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND THE PILE OF SCRAP IRON BECAME THE FIRST AFFORDABLE AUTOMOBILE WHICH WOULD PUT THE WORLD ON WHEELS AND ALTER THE NATURE OF WORK AND LIFE. WHAT ENDED UP MAKING THE STORY REMARKABLE WAS NOT ONE OUTSTANDING GENIUS OR ONE COMPANY. IT WAS HOW THE ENTIRE ECONOMY TOOK AN INVENTION AND TURNED IT INTO AN ENGINE FOR PROSPERITY. THE AFFORDABLE AUTOMOBILE DO NOT JUST DO NOT CREATE A BUSINESS. IT CREATED THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES. IT BROUGHT OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS ABLE TO REACH MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER BEFORE. ENTIRE GENERATIONS WOULD PASS WITHOUT SEEING -- THE PACE OF HUMAN PROGRESS CHANGED DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. IT HAS ACCELERATED EVER SINCE. THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY WAS NOT THE CLEAR WINNER FOR THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE YEAR. IT WAS TWO BROTHERS FROM KITTY HAWK, NOT KILL AND A, WHO ALSO -- KITTY HAWK, NORTH CAROLINA, WHO ALSO HAD A BREAK THROUGH THAT YEAR. HERE WE STAND MORE THAN A CENTURY LATER. THE ECONOMIC CHANGES STILL ACCELERATING. WHEN MY FIRST CHILD WAS BORN AFTER THE TURN OF THIS NEW CENTURY, THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS FACEBOOK OR YOUTUBE OR AN IPHONE. IN FACT, ONLY 40% OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS ON THE INTERNET. JUST 15 YEARS LATER, MY CHILDREN CAN ACCESS THE WORLD'S KNOWLEDGE FROM THE SUPERCOMPUTERS IN THEIR POCKET. THEY CAN ALSO ACCESS THE GAME MINECRAFT WHICH I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT. [LAUGHTER] THEY LIVE IN A -- THEY LIVE IN AN ECONOMY WHERE AMAZON DOES NOT OWN A SINGLE STORE. THE LARGEST TREPIDATION COMPANY, UBER, IT DOES NOT OWN A VEHICLE'S. THE LARGEST ACCOMMODATION PROVIDERS, AIRBNB, DOES NOT OWN A SIEGEL HOTEL. -- DOES NOT OWN A SINGLE HOTEL. IT IS NOT BUILT ON A SINGLE CHANGE, BUT ON CHANGE ITSELF. ON THE FACT THAT TRANSIT -- NUMEROUS INNOVATIONS -- MORE WILL BE ON THE WAY IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THESE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY IS REPLACING JOBS WITH NEW ONES. AND IT HAS TURNED OUR ECONOMY FROM A NATIONAL ONE TO AN INTERNATIONAL ONE. DETROIT NEEDS A LESSON IN THIS. GLOBALIZATION HAS UPENDED THE AUTO INDUSTRY. CARS ARE NOW BASICALLY COMPUTERS ON WHEELS. THIS CITY MUST COMPETE WITH MANY OTHERS TO DESIGN THE BEST PRODUCTS AT THE BEST PRICES. THIS TRANSITION HAS NOT BEEN EASY HERE AT FOR MANY YEARS, THE POWER OF THESE IMPACTING DETROIT HAS MADE IT HARDER. REGULATIONS WERE CRIPPLING. CRONY CAPITALISM WAS RANCID. THE RESULT WERE INEFFICIENCY AND A LAG IN TIMING. OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF DETROIT VOMITED. -- DETROIT PLUMMETED. WASHINGTON IS LEADING THE NATION -- WHILE AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS BUILT ON CHANGE, IT IS CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS RESISTANT TO CHANGE. OTHERS ARE ADAPTING TO THE ECONOMY, WHILE WASHINGTON IS HOLDING ONTO THE OLD ECONOMY. AS A RESULT, AMERICA IS NO LONGER THE BEST PLACE FOR THE HENRY FORD'S OF TODAY TO CREATE THE BUSINESSES OF TOMORROW. WHILE INNOVATIONS KEEP TRANS FORMING OUR WORLD, OUR ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR PEOPLE. SO THAT MAKES THIS ELECTION A GENERATIONAL CHOICE ABOUT WHAT WE DO NEXT. HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES THE WAY TO WIN THE RACE IS TO DRIVE IN REVERSE. TO REVERT BACK TO MORE REGULATIONS, HIGHER TAXES, BIGGER GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE THE WAY FORWARD IS TO EMBRACE THE FUTURE. MODERNIZE OUR GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE WE WILL ONCE AGAIN MAKE AMERICA THE BEST PLACE TO CREATE JOBS. IF WE EMPOWER AMERICANS TO FILL THOSE JOBS, THEN OUR GENERATION WILL EMBRACE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. THAT WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY. TODAY, DETROIT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN UNDER PROBE BUSINESS LEADERSHIP. OTHER GOVERNOR SNYDER, CORPORATE DRIVE -- ORBIT TAXES HAVE DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY. THANKS TO NUMEROUS PROGROWTH REFORMS, MICHIGAN NOW HAS ONE OF THE BEST ENTREPRENEURIAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE COUNTRY. AS A RESULT, INNOVATION IS SURGING. JOBS ARE RETURNING. LIGHTS ARE BACK ON AND BUILDINGS THAT WERE ONCE VACANT. WHILE IT IS TRUE, THE CITY RECEIVED HELP FROM CHECK -- RECEIVED HELP FROM TAXPAYERS, -- A REFORMED ECONOMY. NOT A BAILOUT. MANY OF THE BUSINESS LEADERS IN THIS ROOM CAN ATTEST, ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES BETWEEN DETROIT AND ITS FUTURE CONTINUES TO BE WASHINGTON, DC. UNTIL WASHINGTON LEARNS WHAT THE CITY HAS ALREADY LEARNED, OUR ENTIRE NATION WILL BE HELD BACK FROM A NEW ECONOMY. THAT IS WHY IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT, MY AGENDA WILL BE -- OUR REFORMS WILL BE BASED ON ADDRESSING THE MODERN CHALLENGES OUR PEOPLE FACE IN THEIR LIVES. TODAY, I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO DESCRIBE TO YOU MY AGENDA. HOW IT WOULD PLAY OUT IN THE LIVES OF TWO HYPOTHETICAL PEOPLE FROM DETROIT. A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OPERATING A AUTO BILL -- OPERATING AN AUTOMOBILE SHOP, AND A YOUNG WOMAN WORKING AT THE FRONT DESK. AS WE SEE, THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IS A RESULT OF WASHINGTON'S FAILINGS. LET'S CALL OUR BUSINESS OWNER DAVID. HE OWNS A FRANCHISE OF A NATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR COMPANY. HE HAS 10 EMPLOYEES. IN THE PAST, DAVID NEVER CONSIDERED HIMSELF A POLITICAL PERSON. HE NEVER THOUGHT HIS LIFE WAS IMPACTED MUCH BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON. LATELY, HIS COSTS HAVE BEEN SOARING. WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS BOOKS, IT WAS CLEAR WHY. FIRST, THE COST OF EQUIPMENT. OUTDATED TRADE RESTRICTIONS ARE PREVENTING HIS FRANCHISE FROM FINDING PRODUCTS THAT ARE AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE. WASHINGTON CONTINUES TO TAX WHAT HE INVESTS IN MODERNIZING HIS EQUIPMENT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR ECONOMY NEEDS BUSINESSES LIKE DAVID'S TO INTEGRATE NEW TECHNOLOGY. NEXT COMES LABOR COSTS. IT IS GETTING HARDER -- IS GETTING HARDER FOR DAVID -- ONE IS THE RISING COST OF HEALTH CARE UNDER OBAMACARE. IT COST THE AVERAGE BUSINESS $15,000 A YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT HAS MANDATED OVERTIME PAY TO MILLIONS OF SALARIED WORKERS, INCLUDING SEVERAL OF DAVID'S EMPLOYEES. A TOP OF THAT, DAVID IS STRUGGLING BEHIND HIS MECHANIC WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW CARS ARE CHANGING. HE NEEDS THEM TO HAVE CERTIFICATION AND THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY. THEN THERE IS HIS RECEPTIONIST, DAVID HAS BEEN HER BOSS FOR FIVE YEARS. HE CARES ABOUT HER. HE IS PROUD THAT HE PAYS HER $9.50 AN HOUR WHICH IS MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. HE KNOWS THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR HER TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SECURITY. IT BOTHERS HIM TO HEAR HILLARY CLINTON ON ABOUT HOW CRUEL BUSINESS LEADERS CAN BE WITH THEIR LOW WAGES. HE KNOWS THE MINIMUM WAGE OR TO JUMP TO $15 AN HOUR, HE WOULD HAVE TO CUT AND YELLS JOB. -- YOU HAVE TO CUT DANIELLE'S JOB. HE IS TALKING ABOUT SHIFTING HER TO A PART-TIME POSITION WHICH WOULD SAVE HIM IN THE PACIFIC -- SAVE HIM A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT UNDER OBAMACARE. HE KNOWS HIS CUSTOMERS PREFERS THE PERSONALIZED SERVICE DANIELLE BRINGS. THE NEXT EXPENSE YES TO CONSIDER IS COMPLYING. THERE ARE STRICT RULES ON ANYTHING FROM HOW HE DISPOSES OF RAGS TO HOW HE APPLIES TOUCHUP PAINT TO CARS. SOME OF THESE REGULATIONS HE UNDERSTANDS. SOME OF THEM SEEM UNNECESSARY. HE HAS HAD TO HIRE A LAWYER TO MAKE SURE HE DOES NOT VIOLATE THESE REGULATIONS. WASHINGTON AGENCIES ARE THREATENING HIM IN OTHER WAYS. THEY ARE ON THE VERGE OF DECLARING HE CANNOT EVEN OWN HIS OWN BUSINESS. HE IS A JOINT EMPLOYER. THE LIKELY IMPACT IS THAT FEWER FRANCHISES WILL OPEN. COSTS WILL INCREASE FOR EXISTING ONES LIKE HIS. ALL OF THESE CALLS PALIN COMPARISON TO WHAT COMES NEXT. IF THERE IS ONE THING THREATENING TO FORCE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS IS HIS TAXES. WASHINGTON TAKES ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE DOLLARS THAT HE EARNS. BY THE TIME HE FACTORS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, HE PAYS ABOUT 40% OF EVERYTHING HE MAKES TO TAXES. THIS MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO GROW HIS BUSINESS OR GIVE ANYONE RAISES. IF HE DID, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REWARD HIM BY TAKING HALF OF WHAT HE EARNS. BY THE TIME HE COUNTS FOR ALL THESE CALLS, DAVID IS LUCKY IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO SPEND ON ADVERTISING OR FACILITY IMPROVEMENT. IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT HE WILL HAVE TO HIKE PRICES OR LAY OFF WORKERS. WITH ALL OF THIS, IS IT ANY WONDER THAT SO MANY AMERICANS FEEL LIKE GIVING UP ON THE DREAM OF OWNING A BUSINESS? IS IT ANY SURPRISE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 35 YEARS, WE HAVE MORE BUSINESSES DYING THAN STARTING? A PROGROWTH AGENDA WILL NOT JUST HELPED DAVID, IT WILL ALSO HELP HIS EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING DANIELLE. DANIELLE LIKE SO MANY YOUNG WOMEN WAS ABANDONED BY THE FATHER OF HER CHILDREN. LEFT TO RAISE HER TWO KIDS ALONE DID SHE MOVED INTO A SMALL APARTMENT THAT'S A SMALL APARTMENT IN DETROIT. SHE WORKS 40 HOURS A WEEK AT $9.50 AN HOUR. AFTER RENT, HER BIGGEST EXPENSE IS CHILDCARE. IT COSTS ABOUT $350 A MONTH. THAT IS ON THE LOW END FOR CITIES LIKE DETROIT. NEXT COMES OR GAS ANALYST BILL WHICH ARE USUALLY ABOUT 100 DOLLARS COMBINED. THE INTERPRETATION CAUSE. DETROIT HAS A SPRAWLING JOB MARKET. MEANING DANIELLE HAS TO DRIVE 25 MINUTES TO GET TO WORK AND 25 MINUTES TO GET BACK. GAS IS $100 A MONTH. HER CAR PAYMENT IS $200 A MONTH. INSURANCE COULD COST SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DETROIT. IT IS EASY TO SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING. AT THE TIME SHE FACTORS IN FOOD AND CLOTHING AND ALL THE OTHER COSTS OF RAISING CHILDREN, DANIELLE'S WAGE AT THE AUTO REPAIR SHOP IS NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP HER OUT OF THAT OR OFF OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. TO FIND YOURSELF ON THE IS OF POVERTY AND SLIPPING OVER. -- SHE FINDS HERSELF ON THE EDGE OF POVERTY AND SLIPPING OVER. SHE DREAMS OF ADVANCING TO A BETTER PAYING POSITION. SHE HAS DAVID WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET HIRED AS A MECHANIC? WHICH WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE HER PAY. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL ON NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS AND IT WILL COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND TIME AWAY FROM WORK AND FAMILY SHARED SHE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. LIKE ALL PARENTS, SHE DREAMS THAT HER CHILDREN'S LIVES WILL BE BETTER THAN HER OWN. SHE TELLS THEM THAT THEY CAN BE ANYTHING THEY WANT. SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY ARE UP AGAINST. SHE KNOWS SHE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SEND THEM TO A STRUGGLING PUBLIC SCHOOL. SHE KNOWS SHE WILL NOT BE OF TO SAVE FOR THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION. ALL OF HIS LEAVES DANIELLE FEELING HOPELESS. SHE LIKE MILLIONS FEEL AS IF THE AMERICAN DREAM, THE IDEA THAT A PERSON CAN GO AS FAR AS THEIR WORK CAN TAKE THEM, THEY FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE OR IT DOESN'T APPLY TO PEOPLE LIKE HER. THE CHALLENGES FACING DAVID AND DANIELLE R, ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHILE THEIR NAMES MIGHT BE FICTION, THEIR STORIES ARE TOO REAL. YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE. SO DO I. PEOPLE LIKE DAVID AND DANIEL HAVE NO LOBBYIST AND WASHINGTON. BOTH PARTIES HAVE LET THEM DOWN. HISTORY IS GOING TO JUDGE US BY WHAT WE DO NEXT. IF WE CONTINUE TO CLING TO AN OUTDATED TAX CODES, A FAILING -- NUMEROUS POLICIES THAT MAKE IT HARDER FOR BUSINESSES TO GROW AND OPPORTUNITIES TO FLOURISH. WE WILL BE THE FIRST GENERATION IN OUR HISTORY TO PASS A WEAKER AMERICA ON TO OUR CHILDREN. IF WE EMBRACE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, WE WILL PUT DAVID AND DANIELLE IN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN DESTINY. WE WILL PUT THEM WITHIN REACH OF THEIR AMERICAN DREAM. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL BEGIN BY OVERHAULING OUR TAX CODES. OVERHAULING IT TO MAKE IT PROGROWTH AND PROFAMILY, BECAUSE IT IS NEITHER. AMERICA WILL NEVER BE THE GLOBAL LEADER IN THE CENTURY IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE -- TO HAVE THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE. MICHIGAN WILL LOSE $11.7 BILLION IN GDP OVER THE LONG TERM IF NOTHING CHANGES. MY TAX PLAN WILL BEGIN BY CUTTING THE CORPORATE RATE TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE AVERAGE OF 25% FOR DEVELOPED NATIONS. IT WILL CUT THE TOP TAX RATE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE DAVID'S. THIS WOULD SAVE HIM AROUND 50%. HE CAN USE THAT INCREASE -- SAVE HIM AROUND 15%. HE CAN USE THAT INCREASE. NEXT, MY TAX PLAN WOULD HELP BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE DAVID AT THAT HIS THIS IS TO THE NEW ECONOMY -- DAVID ADAPT HIS BUSINESS TO THE NEW ECONOMY. THIS WILL LOWER HIS TAX BURDEN AND ENCOURAGE ALL THIS IS OWNERS TO INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY ON THE CUTTING-EDGE. THE NONPARTISAN TAX FOUNDATION FOUND MY PLAN WOULD GROW THE ECONOMY BY 15%. IT WOULD GROW WAGES BY 12.5%. IT WOULD CREATE 2.7 MILLION NEW FULL-TIME JOBS. THIS HELPS EVERYONE. AN INCREASE IN DANIEL'S WAGES WOULD AMOUNT TO $205,000 A YEAR. THE PROFAMILY SIDE WOULD HELP DANIELLE EVEN MORE. RIGHT NOW SHE GETS A $1000 TAX CREDIT FOR EACH OF HER TWO KIDS. THIS DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO MEETING THE COST SHE FACES AS A PARENT. IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE INVESTMENT SHE IS MAKING IN AMERICA'S TEACHER AS A MOTHER. MY TAX PLAN WOULD RAISE HER PER CHILD TAX CREDIT TO AS MUCH AS $2500, ALLOWING DANIELLE TO KEEP MORE OF OUR MONEY. I WOULD CHANGE THE WAY SHE RECEIVES ASSISTANCE. INSTEAD OF GETTING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AT THE END OF YEAR, SHE WOULD RECEIVE A WAGE ENHANCEMENT CREDIT. THIS WOULD REWARD AND ENCOURAGE HARD WORK AND AMOUNT TO ABOUT $500 MORE PER YEAR TO DANIELLE MAY CHOOSE TO GET MARRIED. THE CURRENT TAXCO WOULD PUNISH HER FOR MAKING -- THE CURRENT TAXCO WOULD PUNISH HER FOR MAKING THAT DECISION. MY TAX PLAN WOULD REMOVE THIS PENALTY. NOTHING HAS THE ABILITY TO PROVE HER CHILDREN'S FUTURE MORE THAN THE CHANCE TO BE RAISED IN A LOVING TWO-PARENT HOME. TO HELP THEM TO GROW HIS BUSINESS, WE NEED TO LIMIT REGULATIONS. . COMPLYING WITH REGULATIONS HAVE COST OUR ECONOMY. WASHINGTON AS MORE RULES EVERY WEEK. LAST WEEK, REGULATORS PUBLISHED $205 MILLION OF REGULATORY COSTS. LED BY A NEW EFFICIENCY STANDARD FOR SEALING -- FOR CEILING FAN LIGHT KIDS. -- LIGHT KIDS. I WOULD STOP IT BY INSTITUTING A REGULATORY BUDGET THAT LIMITS THE COSTS OF EACH AGENCY'S RULES AND WHAT THEY CAN IMPOSE. WHEREVER TO STOP UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS FROM ORGANIZING THE ECONOMY WITH A STROKE OF THE PEN. LIKE THE NATIONAL LABOR BOARD HAS THREATENED. IT IS A RISK TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE 216 MICHIGAN JOBS. WE WILL LOWER THE COST FOR BUSINESSES BY EMBRACING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. TRADE IS VITAL FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. INCREASINGLY, EVERY INDUSTRY AND OUR ECONOMY AS WELL. IN MICHIGAN, TRADE ACCOUNTS FOR 1.2 MILLION JOBS. IT COULD ACCOUNT FOR EVEN MORE. AS A PRESIDENT, I WILL LOOK FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND FREE TRADE. FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO OPEN UP OUR PRODUCTS IN MORE MARKETS THAN EVER. IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE FINALIZE THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. OUR GROWING ECONOMY AND A PROFAMILY TAX CODES WOULD EASE DANIELLE'S BURDENS. TO TRANSFORM HER LIFE, JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET A HIGHER PAYING JOB. HIGHER EDUCATION IS NO LONGER AN OPTION. NOT IN THIS NEW AMERICA. IT IS A CRUCIAL PATHWAY TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. FOR MOST OF OUR PEOPLE. FOR DANIELLE TO BECOME A MECHANIC, SHE WILL NEED TO TO FIVE YEARS OF FORMAL TRAINING UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM. TO BRING THIS WITHIN HER REACH, I WILL OVERHAUL OUR OUTDATED EDUCATION SYSTEM. I WILL CHANGE HOW SHE RECEIVED HER TRAINING. HOW MUCH IT COSTS. AND HOW HER PAYMENTS ARE DETERMINED. HILLARY CLINTON CAME UP WITH A PLAN. HERE IS WHAT IT IS. TO RAISE TAXES AND THROW $350 BILLION AT A CURRENT BROKEN EDUCATION SYSTEM WITHOUT DOING A SINGLE THING TO FIX ITS UNDERLYING PROBLEMS. THIS IS LAZY LEADERSHIP. I WILL DO THE HARD WORK TO MODERNIZE OUR SYSTEM. I WILL EXPOSE HIGHER EDUCATION TO COMPETITION WHICH WILL PROMPT A REVOLUTION DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS LIKE DANIELLE. I WILL DO SO BY ESTABLISHING A NEW ACCREDITATION PROCESS THAT WELCOMES LOW-COST, INNOVATIVE PROVIDERS. I WILL ALSO HELP DANIELLE FIND MORE AFFORDABLE ROUTES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WILL EXPAND A PRETTY SHIFT -- WE WILL EXPAND APPRENTICESHIP RAMPS. -- APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. EMPOWERING DANIELLE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. WE ALSO NEED TO EMPOWER HER TO EMPOWER HER OWN CHILDREN. IF DANIELLE HAD FOUR CHILDREN -- HAD MORE MONEY, SHE WOULD BE UP TO SEND HER KIDS TO ANY SCHOOL SHE WANTED. SHE SHOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT REGARDLESS OF HER INCOME. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, SHE WILL. I HAVE PROPOSED A TAX CREDIT THAT ENCOURAGES PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOLARSHIP GRANTING ORGANIZATIONS WHICH IN TURN DISTRIBUTES SCHOLARSHIPS TO CHILDREN IN NEED LIKE HERS. THESE REFORMS AND MANY MORE WOULD LAY THE FOUNDATION OF A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY. IT WOULD ONLY BE THE BEGINNING. I WOULD LEAD CONGRESS TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE FOR SENIORS. WITHOUT CHANGING THEM FOR CURRENT SENIORS LIKE MY MOTHER. I WOULD MODERNIZE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM TO MAKE IT A SKILL AND MERIT-BASED ONE RATHER THAN A FAMILY-BASED ONE. I WILL PROTECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THROUGH A FOREIGN POLICY THAT REESTABLISHES AMERICAN STRENGTH AROUND THE WORLD. NONE OF THESE CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE EASY, BUT MEANINGFUL CHANGE NEVER IS. DETROIT KNOWS BETTER THAN MOST. THIS CITY WAS NOT BUILT BY MANAGERS. IT WAS NOT BUILT BY BUREAUCRATS. THIS CITY WAS BUILT BY VISIONARIES, BY PEOPLE WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE OLD WAY OF DOING THINGS. REFUSE TO BE BOUND BY THE RESTRAINTS OF THE PAST. HENRY FORD ONCE SAID ""IF I HAD ASKED PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT, THEY WOULD HAVE SAID FASTER."" -- THEY WOULD'VE SAID FASTER HORSES."" OUR GOVERNMENT IS LED BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD RATHER TWEAK THE CURRENT SYSTEM THEN REVOLUTIONIZE HOW WE DO THINGS. THEY PUMP MORE MONEY INTO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM OF THE 1900S. THINKING IT WILL PREPARE OUR PEOPLE FOR SUCCESS. THEY RELY ON THE PROGRAMS OF THE 1930'S WITHOUT SAVING THEM. THEY EXPAND THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS OF THE 1950'S, HOPING THEY WILL HELP THE STRUGGLING ESCAPE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES LIKE THEY DID IN THE 1990'S, THINKING IT WILL INCREASE OPPORTUNITY. THE RESULT OF THIS OUTDATED APPROACH IS ALL AROUND US. THE INSECURITY OF OUR PEOPLE'S LIVES, THE CHALLENGES RAISING AMERICANS LIKE DAVID AND DANIELLE. THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE WE ARE LEAVING FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN. A DECADE FROM NOW, ALL FOUR OF MY CHILDREN WILL BE ADULTS. I FOR ONE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE AMERICA OUR PARENTS LOVED WAS THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH, BUT THE ONE WHERE LEAVING THEM IS NOT. LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING SOMETHING I SAY EVERYWHERE. AMERICA DOES NOT GO ME ANYTHING. I HAVE A DEBT TO AMERICA I WILL NEVER REPAIRED. -- I WILL NEVER REPAY. THIS IS NOT JUST A NATURE -- THIS IS NOT JUST A NATION I WAS BORN IN. WHEN MY FATHER WAS NINE YEARS OLD, MY -- NINE YEARS OLD, HIS MOTHER DIED. HE WOULD WORK FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE. WHEN HE WAS YOUNG, MY FATHER HAD DREAMS. THOSE DREAMS BECAME IMPOSSIBLE. HERE IN AMERICA, HIS CHILDREN'S FUTURE BECAME THE PURPOSE OF HIS LIFE. FOR YEARS, MY FATHER WORKED AS A BARTENDER IN A ROOM JUST LIKE THIS. ON NIGHTS, WEEKENDS, HOLIDAYS. ON DAYS I'M SURE HE DIDN'T WANT TO, HE WORKED. HE WORKED, BECAUSE HE WANTED ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE POSSIBLE FOR US. MY FATHER STOOD BEHIND A PORTABLE BAR IN A ROOM LIKE THIS . SO ONE DAY I COULD STAND IN FRONT OF THE ROOM LIKE THIS. THAT ROOM FROM -- THE JOURNEY FROM BEHIND THAT BAR TO BEHIND THIS MICROPHONE FOR ME IS THE ESSENCE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT'S NOT JUST MY STORY, THIS IS OUR STORY. WE ARE ALL JUST A GENERATION REMOVED FROM SOMEONE WHO MADE OUR PURPOSE DECIMATE OUR FUTURE THE PURPOSE OF THEIR LIFE. NOW IT IS OUR TURN. NOW IT IS OUR TURN TO LEAVE FOR OUR CHILDREN WHAT OUR PARENTS LEFT FOR US. IT DRIVES IT FOR THE BETTER. WE HAVE TO RISE TO THE TASK OF OUR TIME. IF WE ADAPT TO THE FUTURE, WE CAN EXPAND THE AMERICAN DREAM TO REACH MORE PEOPLE AND CHANGE MORE LIVES THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU AND I AND THIS GENERATION CAN WRITE THE GREATEST CHAPTER, IN THE MOST AMAZING STORY OF AMERICA. YOU AND I ARE BLESSED. WE LIVE IN THE MOST EXCITING ERA OF HUMAN HISTORY. IF WE LOOK YESTERDAY, WE ARE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND BY TOMORROW. IF WE ELECT A LEADER FROM YESTERDAY, THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR OUR FASTER HORSES. IF WE EMBRACE THE NEW AMERICAN ECONOMY,, SMITS THAT OUR PEOPLE WILL MAKE -- IF WE EMBRACE THE NEW AMERICAN ECONOMY, THE ADVANCEMENTS THAT OUR PEOPLE WILL MAKE WILL -- [APPLAUSE] >> SENATOR, YOUR REMARKS HAVE GENERATED A LOT OF QUESTIONS. SOME VIA THE INTERNET. SOME ON OUR BLUE CARD. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO MIX THOSE. THE QUESTION THAT HAS RECEIVED THE MOST INTEREST VIA THE INTERNET IS HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE HIGHLIGHT THE POLITICAL AGGRESSION ON MINORITY POPULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY ASKING AMERICANS ECHO MR. RUBIO: THIS IS A LEGITIMATE ISSUE. I BELIEVE THEY ARE PURSUING A COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WAY. WE HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF OUR POPULATION WHO FEEL THEY ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY OPPORTUNITY, BY THE AMERICAN DREAM, BY OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. WE CANNOT IGNORE IT. MANY COMMUNITIES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE TERRIBLE. I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE. THIS IS A LEGITIMATE ISSUE. I KNOW SOMEONE, A YOUNG AFGHAN AMERICAN MALE WHO HAPPENS TO BE A POLICE OFFICER -- A YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE WHO HAPPENS TO BE A POLICE OFFICER, WHO WAS STOPPED SEVERAL TIMES LAST YEAR. YOU STOP ME A TIMES FOR NO REASON, -- SO WOULD YOU. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERYWHERE. WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT. WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS A LEGACY OF RACIAL DISSEMINATION. 50 YEARS AGO IT WAS STILL LEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. THIS DOES NOT GO AWAY OVERNIGHT. YOU CAN CHANGE LOSS, BUT THE IMPACT STILL REMAINS. THIS IS AN ISSUE. WE NEED TO CONFRONT IT AS A NATION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT LAW I CAN PASS. OUR SOCIETY BETTER ADJUST THIS ISSUE, BECAUSE WE CANNOT SUCCEED AS A COUNTRY IF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COUNTRY FEEL LOCKED OUT FROM THE PROMISE. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. A LOT OF THAT INVOLVES GOVERNMENT ACTION. I HOPE WE TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. I AM PROUD THAT IN THE FLORIDA LEGISLATION WE DID ADJUST IT. WE INSTITUTED THAT PROGRAM IN THE INNER CITY OF MIAMI. IT HAS SPREAD TO ORLANDO AND JACKSONVILLE. IT IS NOT A SOLUTION FOR EVERYONE. IT CREATES A GEOGRAPHIC ZONE THAT SAYS IN THIS AREA, NOBODY WILL FAIL. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD ALL OF OUR CHILDREN WILL SUCCEED. WE EXPECT FROM THEM WHAT WE EXPECT FROM CHILDREN EVERYWHERE. IT WORKS. WE CREATED A COMMISSION TO STUDY BLACK MEN AND BOYS. WE CONCERNED AND SOUTH FLORIDA DESK IN THE CHANCES OF THEM GOING TO JAIL WAS HIGHER THAN THEM GOING TO COLLEGE. AMONG THOSE YOUNG MEN COULD BE THE PERSON WHO CURES PANCREATIC CANCER, OR THE FIRST MAN OR WOMAN TO WALK ON MARS. THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR US TO PRIORITIZE. WE CANNOT BE A GREAT NATION WHEN A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR NATION FEELS LOCKED OUT. >> ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT LESSONS DO YOU TAKE FROM THE STRONG SUPPORT OF NONESTABLISHMENT AND IT'S LIKE DONALD TRUMP? OR BEN CARSON? MR. RUBIO: PEOPLE ARE UPSET AND ANGRY. WE CAN USE THIS ANGER TO MOTIVATE US, BUT WE CANNOT LET THIS ANGER TO FIND US. THIS IS NOT AN ANGRY NATION. THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN A HOPEFUL NATION. THIS IS BEEN A COUNTRY -- THIS HAS BEEN A COUNTRY THAT ASKED WHAT HIS NEXT? HOW CAN WE BE GREATER. THIS IS A NATION OF PERPETUAL IMPROVEMENT. WE HAVE CHALLENGES. WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THEM. WE DO -- WE SHOULD HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT IT. WE CAN'T LET ANGER TO FIND US AS A PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT AN ANGRY PEOPLE. WE ARE A HOPEFUL PEOPLE. WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY. SOME SAY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEBTS WERE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AMERICA IS GREAT. -- WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AMERICA IS GREAT. THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY. THE ISSUE IS WE COULD BE GREATER. THIS NATION COULD BE GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. AS I SAID, GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY, WE WILL US THAT -- WE WILL ASTONISH THE WORLD. I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I WANT TO GET STARTED. THE LONGER WE WAIT, THE MORE PEOPLE WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND. >> COMING FROM THE CARDS, HOW DO YOU VIEW WHAT EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS DONE AND WHAT SHOULD BE THE PUNISHMENT? MR. RUBIO: EDWARD SNOWDEN IS A TRAITOR. IF HE BELIEVES THERE WAS ABUSES, THERE WAS A SYSTEM IN PLACE. IF THE DESK THE SYSTEM DID NOT INVOLVE GOING TO RUSSIA AND CHINA -- THE SYSTEM DID NOT INVOLVE GOING TO RUSSIA AND CHINA AND GIVING UP OUR SECRETS. THERE ARE MANY WOMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE IN DANGER BECAUSE OF WHAT HE HAS DONE. I BELIEVE IF WE CATCH A SINGLE MEMBER OF OUR GOVERNMENT VIOLATING OUR PROGRAM, WE SHOULD INDICT HIM, CONVICT THEM AND PUT THEM IN JAIL. WE MUST KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR ADVERSARIES THAN WHAT WE KNOW -- THEM WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT US. SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAYS IS FLAT OUT LIES. HE SHOULD SUBJECT HIMSELF TO AMERICAN JUSTICE AND SERVICE TIME IN JAIL FOR BEING A TRAITOR. [APPLAUSE] >> HOW DO YOU PLAN TO TAKE ON ISIS? WITH THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL THE RISE? MR. RUBIO: ISIS IS NOT JUST -- AND IRAQ. THEY HAVE A PRESENCE IN LIBYA. THEY WILL CONDUCT ATTACKS ON EUROPE. THEY HAVE A GROWING PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN. GIVEN THE A IN THE TELEGRAPH LEADERSHIP, ISIS IS LOOKING TO KNOCK THEM OFF. THEY ARE A RADICAL SUNNI MOVEMENT. THEY MUST BE DEFEATED BY SUNNI THEMSELVES. IT IS THE SUNNIS THEMSELVES THE MUST REJECT THAT RADICALISM. IN THE SHORT TERM, I THINK IT WOULD TAKE MORE AMERICAN ACTION. I THINK WE NEED TO CUT OFF THEIR FUNDING AND ALL OF THE PROPAGANDA THEY'RE GETTING BY SUBJECTING THEM TO HUMILIATING DEFEATS. CAPTURED THEIR LEADERSHIP, VIDEOTAPED THEM AND PUT THEM ONLINE FOR THE WORLD TO SEE THAT THESE GUYS ARE NOT INVISIBLE. ULTIMATELY, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE DEFEATED ON THE GROUND BY LOCAL FORCES. IT MAY INVOLVE INJECTIONS, JORDANIANS -- INVOLVE EGYPTIANS, JORDANIANS. THERE ARE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES IN IRAQ THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMELAND. THEY HAVE TO BE UP TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY. THEY ARE AT THE MERCY OF OTHERS DEFENDING THEM. WE SHOULD ALLOW LOCAL FORCES TO DEFEAT THEM. SHARING INTELLIGENCE WITH THEM. ONLY AMERICA CAN CONVENE THIS SORT OF COLLECTIVE ACTION. ISIS CAN BE DEFEATED BUT NOT WITHOUT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. WE WILL IF I AM PRESIDENT. >> WHERE YOU STAND ON THE IRAN DEAL? MR. RUBIO: IT IS A VERY GOOD DEAL FOR IRAN BUT BAD FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. IRAN IS NOT BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS. IRAN IS LED BY A SHIA CLERIC WHO HAS AN APPROXIMATE -- WHO HAS AN APOCALYPTIC VISION OF THE FUTURE. IT ENDS UP WITH THE WHOLE WORLD ENDING UP UNDER THEIR VERSION OF ISLAM. WHEN SOMEONE LIKES THAT -- WAS SOMEONE LIKE THAT ENDS UP WITH A NUCLEAR WEAPON, WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED. HERE'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING, ECONOMIC SECTIONS THAT SAY TO THEM WE WILL DEVASTATE YOUR ECONOMY. THE CREDIBLE THREAT OF MILITARY FORCE THAT SAYS IF YOU TRY TO BUILD A WEAPON, WE WILL ATTACK YOU. THIS IS THE ONLY LINK WHICH THEY UNDERSTAND. IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WILL WORK. WHAT WE HAVE SAID IS WE WILL BE NICE YOU IN HOPES THAT YOU WILL BE NICE BACK. WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SECTION RELIEF. -- DOLLARS OF SECTION RELIEF. THEY ARE GOING TO USE IT TO FUND TERRORIST PROXIES AND TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THEY WILL RID OF CENTRIFUGES FROM 1970 AND THEY WILL REPLACE THEM WITH CENTRIFUGES FROM 2015 AND 2016. IN LESS THAN 10 YEARS, THEY WILL HAVE WEAPONS GRADE PLUTONIUM. THEY PROMISED NOT TO CHEAT, BUT THEY WILL DO THEIR OWN INSPECTIONS, THANK YOU. IRAN WILL HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN LESS THAN 10 YEARS. AT THAT POINT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THERE IS ALREADY A CREDIBLE THREAT OF NUCLEAR FORCE. NORTH KOREA. WHY CAN'T WE ATTACK THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN NORTH KOREA? IF WE ATTACK THEIR PROGRAM, THEY WILL ATTACK SEOUL, TOKYO AND HAWAII. IF A RUN WHICH IS THAT CAPABILITY, WE ARE IN A DANGEROUS WORLD. THE WORLD WILL KNOW THAT IF YOU TRY TO BUILD A WEAPON YOU WILL FACE MILITARY FORCE. I DON'T SUPPORT IT AS A FIRST OPTION GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN A NUCLEAR IRAN AND A MILITARY FORCE I WILL TAKE MILITARY FORCE EVERY TIME. [APPLAUSE] >> WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ON CUBA AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RECENT CHANGES THERE. THIS QUESTION SAYS AS FUTURE PRESIDENT WOULD YOU REVERSE ALL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CUBAN CHANGES OR WOULD YOU BE SELECTIVE? SEN. RUBIO: I WOULD CHANGE THEM ALL AND LESS CUBA CHANGES, TOO. I AM NOT HER ONE-SIDED DEALS AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS. LET'S UNDERSTAND THAT CUBA IS NOT SOME COLD WAR HARMLESS RELIC. THEY ARE ANTI-AMERICAN COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP. TODAY IT HOUSES DOZENS OF FUGITIVES OF AMERICAN JUSTICE INCLUDING THE MURDERER OF A POLICE OFFICER IN THE 1970'S WHO THEY HAVE HARBORED FOR 30 YEARS. IT ALSO HARBORS DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO STOLE YOUR MONEY. MEDICARE FRAUDSTERS WHO STOLE MONEY FROM YOU AND OUR LIVING HIGH ON THE HOG. THEY ALSO SEIZED 7 BILLION DOLLARS OF AMERICAN PRIVATE PROPERTY INCLUDING THE HOTEL THAT JOHN KERRY TOWARD THE OTHER DAY. A HOTEL STOLEN FROM THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL COMPANY. SECOND TODAY THEY HOST INTELLIGENCE FACILITIES. THEY HOST A CHINESE LISTENING STATION WHICH THE CHINESE USED TO SPY ON CENTRAL COMMAND, SOUTHERN COMMAND, SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND AND RUSSIA. THE CUBAN SPONSORED TERRORISM EVEN THOUGH WE REMOVE THEM FROM THE LIST OF SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. >> 1.5 YEARS AGO THEY WERE CAUGHT SHIPPING WEAPONS TO NORTH KOREA IN VIOLATION OF HUMAN SANCTIONS. DESPITE ALL OF THIS, THE UNITED STATES UNDER THIS PRESIDENT HAS OPENED UP A DEAL OF MORE TRADE TRAVEL AND REMITTANCES AND EXCHANGE WHAT ARE THEY GIVING --? NOTHING. SINCE THE DEAL WAS SIGNED IN DECEMBER THEY HAVE ARRESTED 3000 ADDITIONAL PEOPLE. LAST WEEKEND AND THE WEEKEND BEFORE THEY RATHER UP AND BEAT AND ARRESTED OVER 90 DISSIDENTS. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SHY ABOUT THIS AT ALL. IF YOU EVER HAVE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING OFFICIAL FROM THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HERE IS THEIR CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS DEAL -- WE WON AND YOU LOST. WE'VE TAKEN ALL OF THE CONCESSIONS WE ASKED FOR AND ARE GIVING NOTHING IN RETURN. NOTHING IS CHANGING. IN FACT THEY ARE NOW DEMANDING THAT WE PAY THEM REPARATIONS FOR THE EMBARGO AND THAT WE TURN OVER GUANTANAMO. I GUESS OTHER THAN ALL OF THAT IT IS A GOOD DEAL BUT I THINK IT IS ONE-SIDED. I AM IN FAVOR OF CHANGES IN POLICY TOWARD CUBA BUT THEY MUST BE MET WITH RECIPROCAL CHANGES. IF YOU WANT MORE TELECOMMUNICATIONS YOU HAVE TO OPEN THE INTERNET. IF YOU WANT MORE TRADE YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE DEMOCRACY. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CHANGING POLICIES, BUT THEY HAVE TO CHANGE, TOO. OTHERWISE, WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE ARE LEGITIMIZING A DICTATORSHIP OF TYRANNY 90 MILES FROM THE SHORE. >> LOTS OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU ON THE POLITICS OF THE RACE. ONE QUESTION WE HAVE IS, HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR YOU TO BE IN THE RACE WITH YOUR FRIEND AND FORMER GOVERNOR JEB BUSH. SEN. RUBIO: IT IS NOT DIFFICULT BECAUSE I AM NOT RUNNING AGAINST JEB BUSH, I RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WE ARE SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND ONE. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I AM NOT RUNNING FOR. I WANT THIS TO BE A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE CAN DO FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHAT MY PARENTS DID FOR ME. I RECOGNIZE THERE ARE OTHER QUALITY PEOPLE RUNNING WHO HAVE LIVED LONGER THAN I HAVE, BUT NONE OF THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT LIFE IS LIKE TODAY FOR AMERICANS BETTER THAN I DO, PERSONALLY AND POLITICALLY. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE PEOPLE RUNNING WHO HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE ON THE ISSUES WE FACED 15 YEARS AGO, BUT NOBODY RUNNING UNDERSTANDS THE ISSUES WE FACE TODAY BETTER THAN I DO OR HAS DONE MORE WORK ON THEM. I AM RUNNING PROUDLY ON WHAT I STAND FOR AND ON THE PROMISE THAT IF WE DO A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS AMERICA WILL BE GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. IT HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN TO BE PLACES LIKE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT NOT AGAINST ANY OF MY FELLOW REPUBLICANS. >> THIS WILL HAVE TO BE OUR LAST QUESTION AS WE ARE JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME. WE WENT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS WITH US. THERE HAVE BEEN MORE QUESTIONS ON PAPER AND THE INTERNET ABOUT HOW YOU AS PRESIDENT CAN HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. YOUR REMARKS CLEARLY OUTLINED A NUMBER OF WAYS BUT HOW WOULD YOU HELP THE SMALL BUSINESS PERSON IN AMERICA? SEN. RUBIO: SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DEEPLY IMPACTED BY THE BIGGER THE GOVERNMENT GETS. IF YOU'RE A BIG CORPORATION YOU MAY NOT LIKE BIG GOVERNMENT BUT YOU CAN HIRE LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS AND COMPLIANCE OFFICERS. IF YOU'RE NOT YOUR STRUGGLING. BIG GOVERNMENT INCENTIVIZES BIG BUSINESS. ONLY THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED CAN DEAL WITH IT. THE MORE POWER THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE MORE POWER THE PEOPLE THAT INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT HAVE AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR ECONOMY. WHAT ARE THE IMPEDIMENTS? THEIR MULTIFACETED. LET'S START WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. IF YOU OF $50,000 YOU CANNOT START A SMALL BUSINESS, YOU NEED A STEADY PAYCHECK. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN AMERICA. YOU DESERVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THAT SCHOOL WITH THAT DEGREE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE MARKET FOR GREEK PHILOSOPHERS HAS TIGHTENED OVER THE LAST 2000 YEARS. [LAUGHTER] THEY GET INTO THE PERSONAL REALM OF STARTING A BUSINESS. THE MORE REGULATED, THE HARDER TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HIRE AN ARMY OF COMPLIANCE OFFICERS. YOU ALSO NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THE PROBLEM IS THE BANKS -- A LOT OF THEM ARE GONE. THE CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING SECTOR HAS REALLY TAKEN A HAMMER. THE ONES THAT USED TO LEND MONEY TO THE SMALL BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN ARE GONE. WE TO CONFRONT THAT AS WELL. THE TAX CODE IS A BIG IMPEDIMENT. THE BIG CORPORATIONS ARE SEE CORPORATIONS. -- ARE C-CORPORATIONS. MOST BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN AMERICA IS HAPPENING THROUGH S -CORPORATIONS OR BUSINESSES. THEY PAY ON A PERSONAL RATE. THAT IS WHY I CALL AND GIVING THEM EQUALITY OF NO MORE THAN 25%. THESE ARE ALL MULTIFACETED BUT WE NEED TO BE MORE PRO-INNOVATION AND ALLOW MORE CAPITATION. MORE -- MORE COMPETITION. MORE BANKS GIVING STUDENT LOANS TO NOT SUBVERT ON-CHIP OR NEWER SHIP -- ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST. EVEN AS I'M SPEAKING TO YOU NOW, IN DETROIT, SOMEONE IN A SPARE BEDROOM IS DRAWING ON A PIECE OF PAPER THE NEXT GREAT IDEA AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE. I WANT THIS TO STILL BE IN PLACE WE CAN START A BUSINESS OUTSIDE A SMALL BEDROOM AND YOUR HOME EVEN IF IT ISN'T WITHIN THE ZONING CODE. [LAUGHTER] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] >>",2015-11-07 18:07:49,2015-08-20,Detroit,Michigan
