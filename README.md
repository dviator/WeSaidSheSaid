## WeSaidSheSaid
-For the development of an application to store, document, and analyze political speeches and the media's interpretation of them.

#Dan
-Created a github for us to work on this together. Hope you guys like the name. Think we should move the backlog from the google sheets into here, to keep things in one place. 

-Decided we should use PostgreSQL for the database. Checked out Mongo and CouchDB but they just didn't fit our use case. Also don't think a cloud database is the way to go yet. We'll all need a local copy so that we can break things as we develop. Next step for me will be to write a script to stand one up for each of us. Then we just need something to store in it. 

#Alex
-Added folder 'video_to_text' because I'm the boss rick ross.
