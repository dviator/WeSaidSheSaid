00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,380
today

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,480
I have the honour and introducing a man

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,760
who needs no introduction the his legend
has been built

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,800
and his accomplishments are too many to
name

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,160
that man is my father the

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,280
most people strive their entire lives to
achieve great success

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,230
in a single fields my father has
succeeded in many

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,870
at the highest level and on a global
scale

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,450
he's enjoyed success in a vast diversity
and industries

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,710
because the common denominator is him

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,880
his vision his brilliance

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,320
his passion his work ethic and his
refusal

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,979
to take no for an answer the I've
enjoyed the good fortune of working

16
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,780
alongside my father for ten years now

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,030
and i've seen these principles in action
daily

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,780
I remember him telling me when I was a
little girl

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,410
even care if you're gonna be thinking
anyway

20
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:31,020
you might as well be thinking Bay and
that's how he approaches

21
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,229
any task that he undertakes he thinks

22
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,430
big my father is employed

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,009
tens of thousands of people throughout
his career and he is inspired them to do

24
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,470
extraordinary things

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,240
he has the strength to make hard
decisions

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,110
and motivate those around him to achieve
the impossible

27
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,830
he is an optimist who chases big dreams

28
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,830
and sees potential where others do not

29
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,009
he leads by example and will

30
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,069
out work anyone in any room

31
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:09,240
my father is

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,860
the opposite a politically correct he
says what he means

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:22,670
and he means what he says the

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,620
he is also the best negotiator

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,270
I have ever met countless times I have
stood by his side

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,680
and watch to make deals that seemed
impossible to get done

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,230
he has the discernment

38
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,230
understand what the other party needs

39
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,250
and then to get exactly what he wants my
father

40
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,650
knows how to be a fierce opponent but
also

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,650
how to be a very loyal friend when it
comes to building bridges

42
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,280
he can do so figuratively but also has
the rare ability

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,350
to do so literally on time and under

44
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:10,090
budget the throughout his career

45
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,860
my father has been repeatedly called
upon by local

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,740
and federal government to step in and
save

47
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:24,239
long-stalled grossly over budget public
projects whether it's building

48
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,390
a skating rink in the heart of Central
Park meticulously restoring

49
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,800
the exterior facade Grand Central
Terminal enabling the development

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,480
a new york city is jacob javits
Convention Center

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,050
creating a championship public golf
course for the City of New York

52
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,680
or redeveloping the iconic

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,920
but totally underutilized all post
office building

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,820
on pennsylvania avenue in the heart of
Washington DC

55
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,430
my father succeeds time and time again

56
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,030
where government has failed before him I
consider myself fortunate

57
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,030
to have learned from the best both as an
entrepreneur or

58
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:17,370
and as a parent my father's a man who is
deeply grounded in tradition

59
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,209
he raise my siblings and me

60
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,360
to work hard and to strive for
excellence

61
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,889
in all that we do he taught us

62
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,879
that we have a responsibility to make a
positive contribution to society

63
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,300
here today my father is again

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,800
leading me by example my generation
finds itself at a crossroads

65
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
our leadership has been mired

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,900
indie rocker C up its own creation if we
don't adapt

67
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,250
politically and economically our country
will be left behind

68
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,580
to address the many challenges we face

69
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,819
we don't need to talk we need action

70
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,560
we need execution we need someone who is
bold and independent

71
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,550
with a proven track record of
successfully creating and building

72
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,370
large and complex and complicated
organizations

73
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,219
and in the process enabling many many
americans to better their lives

74
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,229
I can tell you

75
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,229
that there's no better person than my
father to have in your corner

76
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:30,759
when you're facing tough opponents or
making hard decisions

77
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,719
he is battle-tested he is a dreamer

78
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,800
but perhaps more importantly he is a
doer

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,169

80
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,470

91
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,950
how they gonna beat I sis I don't think

92
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,520
our country is in serious trouble

93
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,460
we don't have victories

94
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,780
anymore we used to have victories but we
don't have 'em when was the last time

95
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,300
anybody saw %uh speeding let's say China

96
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,260
in a trade deal they kill us

97
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,620
IP China all the time all the time

98
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,729
when did we beat Japan

99
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:10,020
at anything they send their cars over

100
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,669
by the millions and what do we do

101
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:19,020
when was the last time use our Chevrolet
in Tokyo

102
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,960
it doesn't exist folks they beat us

103
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,430
all the time when do we beat Mexico

104
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,449
at the border they're laughing at us at
our stupidity and now they're beating us

105
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,680
economically they are not our friend

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,070
believe me but they're killing us
economically

107
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:43,449
the US has become a dumping ground

108
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,039
for everybody else's problems

109
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,120
the

110
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,110
tackle it's true

111
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,599
and these are the best in the finest

112
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,240
when mexico's sends its people they're
not sending their best

113
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,310
they're not sending you they're not
sending you

114
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,490
they're sending people that have lots of
problems

115
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,860
and they're bringing those problems with
us they're bringing drugs

116
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,669
they bring in crime their rapists and
some

117
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,289
I assume a good people but I speak to
border guards

118
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,430
and they tell us what we're getting and
it only makes common sense

119
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,380
it only makes common sense this sending
us

120
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,079
not the right people it's coming from
more than mexico it's coming from all

121
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:37,620
over south and Latin America and it's
coming

122
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,550
probably probably from the Middle East

123
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,800
but we don't know because we have no
protection

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,570
and we have no competence we don't know
what's happening and it's gotta stop

125
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,000
and its gotta stop fast

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,190
the

127
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,500
Islamic terrorism is heating up

128
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,080
large portions up the middle east

129
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,690
they become rich i'm in competition with
them

130
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,740
they just built a hotel in Syria can you
believe this

131
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,890
they built a hotel when I have to build
a hotel

132
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,960
I pay interest then I have to pay
interest because they took the oil

133
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,840
that when we left Iraq I said we should
have taken

134
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,010
so now ices has the oil

135
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,250
and what they don't have

136
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,190
haran haz and in nineteen

137
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,460
and I will tell you this and I said it
very strongly

138
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,800
years ago I said

139
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,370
and I love the military and i wanna have
the strongest military

140
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,980
that we've ever had and we need more now
than ever but I said don't

141
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,280
hit iraq because you don't it totally
destabilize the Middle East

142
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,500
a Rand is going to take over the middle
east

143
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,220
Iran and somebody else will get the oil
and it turned out that Iran is now

144
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,600
taking over iraq

145
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,710
they coveted a rant is taking over iraq

146
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,410
and they take it over big way we sped

147
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,530
to trillion dollars in Iraq to drill
your

148
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,650
we lost thousands of lives

149
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:28,130
thousands in Iraq we have wounded
soldiers who I love I love take great

150
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,980
all over the place thousands and
thousands of wounded soldiers

151
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,200
and we have nothing we can even go there
we have nothing

152
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,340
and every time we give a rack equipment

153
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,680
the first time a bullet goes off in the
air

154
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,460
they leave it last week I read to

155
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,540
thousand 300 hum these

156
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,080
these are big vehicles were left behind
for the enemy

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,420
2000 you would say maybe two

158
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,739
maybe four to thousand

159
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:08,399
300 sophisticated vehicles

160
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:20,629
there and and the enemy to you're right
the last quarter

161
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:25,119
it was just announce are gross domestic

162
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:28,279
product a sign of strength

163
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,199
right but not for us it was

164
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,519
below 0 who ever heard of this it's
never below zero

165
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,749
our labor participation rate was the
worst

166
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:48,199
since 1978 but they give the GDP below
zero

167
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:52,239
horrible labor participation rate and
are real

168
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:57,009
unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20
percent don't believe the 5.6

169
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:01,379
don't believe it that's right a lot of
people up there can't get a job

170
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,269
they can't get jobs because there are no
jobs

171
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,129
because China has our jobs and mexico
has our jobs they all other jobs

172
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,040
but the real number the real number

173
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,610
is anywhere from 18 19 and maybe even 21
percent and nobody talks about it

174
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,769
because it's a statistic thats

175
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:32,250
fallen out sense the

176
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,519
our enemies

177
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,920
are getting stronger and stronger by the
day

178
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,690
and we as a country are getting weaker

179
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,810
even our nuclear arsenal

180
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,600
does it work it came out recently

181
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,000
they have equipment that's thirty years
old they don't even know if it worked

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,630
and I thought it was horrible

183
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,160
when it was broadcast on television
because boy does that send signals

184
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,259
to Putin and all the other people

185
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:06,170
that look at us and they say that is a
group of

186
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,190
people and that is a nation that truly
has no clue take don't know what they're

187
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,750
doing

188
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:21,170
they don't know what they're doing we
have a disaster

189
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,730
called the big lie Obamacare

190
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,079
Obamacare yesterday came out

191
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,930
that costs are going for people

192
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,260
up 29 39 49

193
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,670
and even 55 percent

194
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,540
and deductibles are through the roof you
have to get hit by a tractor

195
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,529
literally a tractor to use it

196
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,769
because the deductibles are so high it's
virtually useless

197
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,819
it is a disaster and

198
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,910
remember the five billion dollar

199
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,779
website five billion we spent their
website

200
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,449
and to this day it doesn't work a5

201
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:13,310
billion dollar website I have so many
web sites have all over the place

202
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,540
I hire people they do a website a cost
me three dollars

203
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,149
5 billion dollar

204
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:33,390
website

205
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,610
where you need somebody

206
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,760
because politicians are all talk no
action

207
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,650
nothing's gonna get done they will not
bring us believe me

208
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,940
to the promise land they will not

209
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,880
as an example I've been on the circuit
making speeches and I hear

210
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,290
my fellow republicans in the wonderful
people

211
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,450
i cum they all want me to support them

212
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,360
they don't know how to bring about the
come up to my office I

213
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,970
a meeting with reaffirming the next week
and they don't know

214
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,430
are you running are you not running
could we have to support

215
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,440
what do we do how do we do it i like 'em

216
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,440
and I hear their speeches and they don't
talk jobs and they don't talk China was

217
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,390
the last time you heard

218
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,170
China is killing us did devaluing their
currency to a level that you wouldn't

219
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,300
believe it makes it

220
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,140
impossible for our companies to compete

221
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,320
impossible they're killing us

222
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,100
but you don't hear that from anybody
else you don't hear it from

223
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,110
anybody else and I watched this features

224
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,590
thank you i watch the speeches are these
people

225
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,110
and they say the Sun will rise

226
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,550
the move will set all sorts of wonderful
things will happen I'll

227
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,020
and people are saying what's going on

228
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,680
I just want a job just get me a job

229
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,860
I don't need the rhetoric I want a job
and that's what's happening and it's

230
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,790
going to get worse because remember

231
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,310
Obamacare really kicks in and 16

232
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,810
2016 Obama is going to be out playing
golf

233
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,820
he might even be on one of my courses I
would invite him I actually would say

234
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,420
I have the best courses in the world
site say you know what if you want see I

235
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,020
have one right next to the white house

236
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,200
right on the potomac if you'd like to
play that's fine

237
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,320
fact I'd love them to leave early and
play that would be a very good

238
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,309
but

239
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:41,049
Obamacare kicks in in 2016

240
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:45,179
really big lake it is going to be

241
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,749
amazingly destructive doctors acquitting

242
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:53,519
I have a friend who is a doctor and he
said to me the other day Donald

243
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,319
I never saw anything like it I have more
accountants

244
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,319
that I have nurses it's a disaster my
patience

245
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,169
are decide themselves they had a plan
that was good they have no plan now

246
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,730
we have to repeal Obamacare and it can
reap

247
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,620
be replayed add it can be replaced with
something much better

248
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,909
for everybody let it be for everybody
but much better and much less expensive

249
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:20,889
for people

250
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:31,330
and for the government and we can do it

251
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,020
show

252
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,980
I've watched the politicians I dealt
with them all my life

253
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,830
if you can't make a good deal with the
politician then there's something wrong

254
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,530
with you you're certainly not very good

255
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,620
and that's what we have representing us

256
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,090
they will never make America great
again.

257
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,790
they don't even have a chance they're
controlled

258
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,110
fully they're controlled falling

259
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,780
by the lobbyists by the donors

260
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,970
and by the special interests clearly
thats

261
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,350
the controller pay I have lobbyists I
had to take I have lobbyist can produce

262
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,320
anything for me

263
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,340
a great but you know what it won't
happen

264
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,410
it won't happen because we have to stop

265
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,080
doing things for some people but for
this country it's destroying

266
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,460
country we have to stop and it has to
stop now

267
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,220
now our country needs

268
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,660
our country needs

269
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:47,590
a truly great leader and we need a truly
great leader now

270
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,289
we need a leader

271
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,669
that wrote the art of the deal we need

272
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:00,780
a leader that can bring back I jobs can
bring back our manufacturing can bring

273
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,220
back our military take care of our vets

274
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:12,630
our vets have been abandoned and we also
need

275
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,890
a cheerleader you know when

276
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,539
President Obama was elected I said well

277
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:25,669
the one thing I think you'll do well I
think he'll be a great cheerleader

278
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:29,309
for the country I think you'd be a great
spirit

279
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:33,500
he was vibrant he was your I really
thought that he would be a great

280
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,280
cheerleader

281
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,350
he's not a leader that's true

282
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,490
you're right about that but he wasn't

283
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,710
a cheerleader he's actually a negative
force it's been a negative force

284
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,880
he was a cheerleader he was the opposite
we need somebody

285
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,750
that can take the brand up the United
States

286
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,250
and make it great again it's not great

287
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,320
again

288
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,430
we me we need some body

289
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,380
we need somebody

290
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,740
that literally will take this country

291
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,580
and make it great again we can do that

292
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,050
and I will tell you I love my life

293
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,810
I have a wonderful family they're saying

294
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,620
dead you gonna do something that's going
to be so tough you know all of my life

295
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,570
I've heard

296
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,060
that a truly successful person really

297
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,240
really successful person and even
modestly successful cannot run

298
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,600
for public office just can't happen and
yet that's the kind of mindset

299
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,230
that you need to make this country great
again so

300
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:59,290
ladies and gentlemen I am officially
running

301
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,760
the

302
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,130
for President of the United States the
and we are going to make

303
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:15,020
our country great again

304
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,960
it can happen

305
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,230
our country has tremendous potential

306
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,640
we have tremendous people we have people
that

307
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,270
aren't working we people that have no
incentive to work

308
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,480
but they gonna have incentive to work
because the greatest

309
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,020
social program is a job and they'll be
proud and they'll love it

310
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,060
and they'll make much more money than
they would've ever made

311
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,160
and they'll be they'll be doing so well
and we're going to be thriving as a

312
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,760
country

313
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,090
thriving it can happen I will be

314
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,250
the greatest jobs president that God

315
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:06,270
ever created I tell you the I'll bring
back I jobs from China from Mexico from

316
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,040
Japan

317
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,730
from so many places I'll bring back I
jobs and I'll bring back our money

318
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,240
right now think if this way out China

319
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,260
1.3 trillion dollars we r Japan

320
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,460
more than that so they come in they take
a job they take our money and then

321
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,950
they'll owners back the money

322
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,960
and we pay them in a dress and then the
dollar goes up

323
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,620
so their deals even better how

324
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,370
stupid our own leaders house stupid

325
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,570
are these politicians to allow this to
happen

326
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:53,279
house stupid art

327
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,679
I'm going to tell you thank you I'm
gonna tell you a couple of stars

328
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,510
about trade because I'm totally against
the trade bill

329
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,889
for a number of reasons number one the
people negotiating

330
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:07,149
don't have a clue our president doesn't
have a clue

331
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:10,399
is a bad to go sheer he's the one that
did Bergdahl

332
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:15,120
we get bad girl they get five killer
terrorists that everybody wanted

333
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,740
over there we get burger we get a
traitor we get a no good trader

334
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,419
and they get the five people that they
wanted for years

335
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:27,450
and those people and now back to the
battlefield trying to kill us

336
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:33,269
that's a negotiator we have take a look
at the deal he's making with Iran

337
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:38,360
he makes that deal Israel maybe won't
exist very long

338
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,010
it's a disaster and we have to protect
Israel

339
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:52,350
but so we need people on the free trader

340
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,409
but the problem with free trade

341
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,500
is unique really talented people

342
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,669
to negotiate for you if you don't have

343
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:06,610
talented people if you don't have great
leadership if you don't have people that

344
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,049
know business is not just a political
hack

345
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,850
they got the job because he made a
contribution to a campaign

346
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:18,470
which is the way all jobs just about a
got free trade is terrible

347
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,889
free trade can be wonderful if you have

348
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:25,389
smart people but we have people that are

349
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:28,679
stupid we have people that aren't smart

350
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,010
I we have people that are controlled by
special interests and

351
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,510
it's just not going to work so here's a
coupla stories happen

352
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,860
recently a friend of mine is a great
manufacture

353
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,590
and you know china comes over and a
double their stuff and i buy it i buy

354
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,929
because frankly I have an obligation to
buy because they devalue their

355
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:52,529
currencies so brilliantly they just did
a recently

356
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:56,149
and nobody thought they could do it
again but with all our problems with

357
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,760
Russia

358
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,809
with all our problems with everything

359
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:02,000
everything

360
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,610
they got away with it again and it's a
possible

361
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,340
for our people here to complete so I
won't tell you the story

362
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,009
for two months a great manufacture calls
me up

363
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,059
few weeks ago is very upset

364
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:20,200
as to what you prop he said you know I'm
a great product I said I know I know

365
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,070
that because i buy the product he said i
cant get it into China

366
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,360
they won't accept it I sent a boat over
and they actually sent it back

367
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,409
they talked about environmental they
talked about also to crap that had

368
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,549
nothing to do with it

369
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:36,309
I said oh wait a minute that's terrible
does anyone know this he said yet they

370
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,100
do it all the time with other people

371
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,480
I said they sent it back yeah so I
finally got it over there

372
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,740
and they charged me a big para did not
supposed to be doing that

373
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,070
I told them now they do charge a tariff
or trucks

374
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,450
when we send trucks and other things
over there s Boeing

375
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,200
they wanted Boeing secrets they wanted
their patents in all their secrets

376
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,850
before they agreed to buy planes from
Boeing pay

377
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm not saying this stupid I'd like
China

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,370
I sell apartment 210 I just sold an
apartment for fifteen million dollars

379
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,460
to somebody from China am I supposed to
dislike

380
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,590
I own a big chunk at the Bank of America
building in 1290 Avenue of the Americas

381
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,070
that I got from China in a war 0

382
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,340
very valuable I love China

383
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,070
the biggest bank in the world is from
China

384
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,720
you know where their United States
headquarters is located

385
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,360
in this building in Trump Tower I love
China

386
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,740
people so you don't like China know I
love

387
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,789
but their leaders are much smarter than
our leaders

388
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:49,070
and we can sustain ourself with that is
too much

389
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,809
it's like it's like take the New England
Patriots and Tom Brady

390
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,820
and have them play your high school
football team

391
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,250
that's the difference between China's
leaders

392
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:05,159
and our leaders they are ripping us we
are rebuilding China

393
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,860
we're rebuilding many countries China
you go there now

394
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,100
roads bridges schools you

395
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,120
this or anything like it they have
bridges that make the George Washington

396
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,730
Bridge look like small potatoes

397
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,250
and they're all over the place we have
all the cards

398
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,440
but we don't know how to use them we
don't even know that we have the cards

399
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,669
because our leaders

400
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,970
don't understand the game we could turn
off that spigot

401
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,419
by charging them tax until they behave
properly

402
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:41,330
now they're going militarily they're
building a military Island

403
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,000
in the middle at the South China Sea a
military Island

404
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,450
now our country could never do that
because we have to get environmental

405
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,539
clearance

406
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:54,770
and the environmentalists would let a
cat we would never build in an ocean

407
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,169
they built in about 1 year this massive
military port

408
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:02,610
they're building up their military to
appoint

409
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,390
that is very scary you have a problem
with my sis you have a bigger problem

410
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,080
with china

411
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,730
and in my opinion the new China believe
it or not in terms of trade

412
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,250
is mexico so this man tells me about

413
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,940
the manufacturing I say that's a
terrible story I hate to hear

414
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,340
but I have another one Ford so mexico

415
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,230
takes a company car company that was
going to build in Tennessee

416
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,490
rips it out everybody thought the deal
was dead reported in the wall street

417
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,270
journal

418
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,049
recently everybody thought it was a done
deal

419
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:43,679
it's going in and that's going to be it
going into tennessee great state great

420
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,169
people

421
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:49,440
all other son at the last moment this
big car manufacture far in

422
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,370
announces they're not going to Tennessee
they gonna spend a billion dollars in

423
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,559
Mexico instead

424
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,070
not good now for denounces

425
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,860
a few weeks ago therefore it is going to
build

426
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,250
82.5 billion dollar

427
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,799
car and dropped and parts

428
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,710
manufacturing plant

429
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,400
in mexico 2.5 billions could be one of
the largest in the world

430
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,210
Fort good company so I announced

431
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,060
that I'm running for president I would

432
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,160

433
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,440
probably before even getting and I
wouldn't even use you know I have I know

434

450
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,710
every car every truck

451
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,490
in every part manufactured in this plant

452
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:49,490
that comes across the border we're going
to charge you a 35 percent tax

453
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,040
hey and that tax

454
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,740
is going to be paid simultaneously with
the transaction and that said

455
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,390
here's what's gonna happen if it's not
me in the position it's one of these

456
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,650
politicians that we're running against
you know that

457
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,270
400 people that were already and here's
what's gonna happen

458
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,760
did not so stupid they know it's not a
good thing

459
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,140
and they may even be upset by but then
they get to get a call from their donors

460
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,200
or probably from the lobbyist for four

461
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,190
say you can't do that to Fort because
forty

462
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,380
takes care of me and I take a review and
you can't do that to Fort

463
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,600
a guess what no problem taken to build
in Mexico they gonna take away thousands

464
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,570

I'm not using the lobbyists are not
using donors I don't care

476
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,070
I'm really rich sure that this by the
way

477
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm not even saying that in a bragger

478
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,980
that's the kind of mindset that's a
kinda think it you need for this

479
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,920
country shell because we can make the
country Ridge it sounds crest somebody

480
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,170

481
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:42,600
not press we got 18 trillion in debt

482
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,130
we got nothing but problems we get a
military that needs equip it all over

483
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,800
the place

484
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,620
we got nuclear weapons that are obsolete
we've got nothing we got social security

485
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,600
that's going to be destroyed

486
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,170
if somebody like me doesn't bring money
into the country all these other people

487
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,320
want to cut the hell outta

488
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,500
I'm not going to cut it all I'm gonna
bring money in

489
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,730
how we're gonna say but here's what's
gonna happen

490
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,290
after I'm called by 30 friends of mine
who contributed

491
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,070
different campaigns after I'm called by
all the special interests and by the

492
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,310
the donors and by the lobbyists

493
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,270
and they have zero chance a convincing
me 0

501
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,030

problems we send over the ship's we said

505
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,840
we're going to protect what we doing

506
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,210
began nothing but money if the right
person

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,950
ask them they pay a fortune they
wouldn't be there

508

the border with Yemen

blown-up

511
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,679
everybody get handicapped are equipped
they always keep our equipment

512
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,200
witness it used equipment right there
was keep our equipment

513
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,580
this is a real job because frankly

514
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,750
it would be where to send our surplus
were always losing this gorgeous friend

515
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,240
mister

516
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,440
but look at that border with Saudi
Arabia do you really think

517
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,340
that these people are interested in
Yemen

518
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,460
Saudi Arabia without us

519
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:00,850
is gone day gone and I'm the one that
made all the right predictions about

520
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,460
iraq

521
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,710
you know all these politicians and I'm
running against

522
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,560
now like it's so nice to say I'm running
as opposed to if I Ron

523
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,000
if I run running

524
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,980
but all these politicians that I'm
running against now

525
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,690
they're trying to disassociate me you
look to push it took him five days

526
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,720
to answer the question on iraqi couldn't
answer the question now

527
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,490
I said is intelligent and I look at
rubia he was unable to answer the

528
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,100
question

529
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,030
is a racket good thing or a bad thing he
didn't know he couldn't answer the

530
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,630
question

531
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,510
how are these people going to lead us
how we couldn't how we gonna go back in

532
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,109
make it great again weekend they don't
have a clue

533
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:45,840
take it lead us they can't they can't
even answer simple questions

534
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,920
it was terrible but Saudi Arabia is in
big big trouble

535
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,530
now thanks to fracking and other things

536
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,880
the Oilers all over the place and I used
to say it

537
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,980
their ships at sea in this was doing the
worst crisis

538
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,540
that were loaded up with oil and the
cartel

539
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,859
kept the pressure because again

540
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:11,540
there was smarter than our lives they
were smarter than a lease

541
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:17,250
there is so much wealth out there that
can make our country so rich again

542
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,190
and therefore make it great again
because we need money

543
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,320
with dying with dying

544
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,570
we need money we have to do it

545
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,820
we need the right people soak

546
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,430
Ford will come back they'll all come
back

547
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,150
and I will say this: this is going to be

548
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,600
an election in my opinion that's based
on

549
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,030
competence somebody said

550
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,750
thank you down

551
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,450
somebody said to me the other day a
reporter very nice reporter

552
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,650
but mister trump you're not a nice
person

553
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,080
that show but actually I am

554
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,210
I think I am a nice person people that
know me like me

555
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,230
does my family like me I think so right
with my fam a proud of my family

556
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,850
by the way speaking to my family Malani
a

557
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,280
barren Chi Donnie

558
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,510
Don Venessa Tiffany

559
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:24,360
a Bocca did a great job did she do a
great job great the Jared Lara

560
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:31,720
and Eric I'm very proud of my family
they're great family so

561
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,390
the reporter said to me the other day
but missed a trap

562
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,080
you're not a nice person how can you get
people to

563
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,910
vote for you I said now I said I think
that

564
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,950
number 1 i'ma nice person give a lot of
money away

565
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,410
to charities and other things I think
I'm actually

566
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,030
a very nice person but I said this is
going to be an election

567
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,140
that's based on competence because
people are tired of these nice people

568
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,580
and they're tired of being ripped off by
everybody in the world

569
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,960
and they're tired of spending more money

570
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,830
on education then any nation in the
world per capita

571
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,070
than any nation in the world

572
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,020
and would 26 in the world 25 countries

573
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,940
are better than I said education and
some of them are like third world

574
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,770
countries

575
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,990
but we're becoming a third world country
because of our infrastructure

576
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,260
our airports are roads everything so one
of the things I did and I said you know

577
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,950
what I'll do

578
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,900
%uh do it because a lot of people said
he'll never run number one you want to

579
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,020
give up his lifestyle

580
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,310
to read about that but I'm doing number
two

581
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,510
I'm a private company so nobody knows
what I'm worth and the one thing is that

582
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,380
when you run

583
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,390
you have to announce and certify

584
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,760
to all sorts of governmental authorities

585
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,530
your net worth so I said that's okay

586
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:05,400
I'm proud of my net with that done an
amazing job I started off

587
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,970
thank you I started off in a small
office with my father in Brooklyn and

588
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,660
Queens

589
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,930
and my father said and I love my father
I learned so much he was a great

590
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:16,809
negotiator

591
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:20,210
I learned so much just sitting at his
feet playing with blocks

592
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,530
listening to him negotiate with
subcontractors

593
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,280
but I learned a lot but he's to say

594
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,319
Donald don't go into Manhattan that's
the big leagues

595
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:34,520
we don't know anything about that don't
do it is it then I gotta go into

596
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,069
Manhattan

597
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:38,950
I got a bill those big buildings I gotta
do it dead I've gotta do it

598
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,210
and after four or five years in Brooklyn

599
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,440
I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot
a great deals the Grand Hyatt Hotel

600
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,230
I was responsible for the convention
center on the west side I did a lot of

601
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,420
great deals and I didn't

602
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,319
early and young and now a building all
over the world and I love what I'm doing

603
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:00,540
but they all said a lot of the pundits
on television

604
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,799
well Donald will never run and what are
the main reasons is

605
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:09,200
his private and he's probably not as
successful

606
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,829
as everybody thinks so I said to myself

607
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:16,920
you know nobody's ever gonna know unless
I run

608
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,680
because I'm really proud of my success I
really here

609
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,279
I've employed I've employed

610
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:29,900
hands up thousands a people

611
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,549
over my lifetime that means medical that
means education

612
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:38,960
that means every so a large accounting
firm in my accountants have been working

613
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,180
for months

614
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,450
because it's big and complex and they
put together

615
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,859
a state financials

616
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:53,410
is a summary but everything will be
filed eventually with

617
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,220
the government and we don't need
extensions or anything will be filing

618
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,200
right on we don't need any and

619
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,740
it was even reported incorrectly
estimate because they said he had assets

620
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,980
up nine billion says nice a wrong number

621
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,230
that's the wrong number not SS so

622
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,510
they put together this and before I say
I have to say this

623
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,940
I made your fashion which real estate
you notes

624
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,029
list its labor and its unions good and
some bad

625
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:32,049
and lots of people that are in unions
and its all over the place

626
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:36,920
and building all over the world and I
have assets

627
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,349
big accounting for while the most highly
respected

628
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:46,069
nine billion 240

629
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:50,089
million dollars and I have

630
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:53,779
liabilities

631
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:57,200
about 500 thats long-term debt

632
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,730
very low interest rates that one of the
big banks came to me said

633
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,700
Donald you don't have another borrowings
could we loan you four billion dollars

634
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,660
that I don't need it

635
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,619
I don't want it and I been there I don't
want it

636
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,809
but in two seconds they give me whatever
I wanted so I have

637
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:18,809
a total net worth and now with the
increase it'll be

638
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:23,210
well over ten billion dollars but here a
total net worth

639
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,529
love eight billion net worth not assets
not liability a net worth

640
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,680
after all dat

641
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,880
after all expenses the greatest asset

642
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,950
Trump Tower 12 ninety Evony the Americas

643
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,260
Bank of America building in San
Francisco

644
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,720
40 Wall Street sometimes referred to

645
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,490
as the Trump building right opposite the
New York's

646
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,780
many other places all over the world so
the

647
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,800
total is eight billion 737

648
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,030
million five hundred and forty thousand
dollars now I'm not doing that

649
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,380
I'm not doing that to Breakers you know
what and at the break I don't have to

650
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,210
believe it or not

651
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,790
I'm doing that this day that that's the
kind

652
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,400
of think Keeney our country needs

653
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,780
we need that think we have the opposite
thinking

654
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,140
we have losers

655
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:27,060
we have losers we have people that don't
have it we have people that are morally

656
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,680
corrupt

657
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,369
we have people that are selling this
country down the drain

658
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:38,040
so I put together the statement and the
only reason I'm telling you about it

659
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,800
today

660
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,010
is because we really do

661
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:45,250
have to get going because if we have

662
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,280
another three or four years you know
where 18 trillion now

663
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,480
we're soon going to be at $20 trillion
according to the economist who are not

664
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,560
big believers in but

665
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,650
nevertheless is what they're saying that

666
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,690
24 trillion we're very close that's the
point

667
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,600
have no return 24 trillion dollars we
will be there soon

668
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,530
that's when we become Greece thats

669
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,930
when we become a country that's on

670
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,440
salvageable and we're gonna be there
very soon we're gonna be there very soon

671
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,390
cell

672
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:28,060
just to sum up I would do

673
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:33,130
various things very quickly I would
repeal and replace the big lie Obama

674
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:33,590
Care

675
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,590
I would build

676
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,770
a great wall and nobody bills was better
than me believe me

677
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:45,130
and I'll build 'em very inexpensively I
will build a great

678
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:49,400
great wall on our southern border and I
will have Mexico

679
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,440
pay for that wall mark my words nobody
would be tougher

680

688
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,420
and we will be using a man like

689
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,430
absolutely no concept of negotiation

690
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,400

Dale who's just being tapped a long as

691

bicycle race at 72 years old

doing that and I promise I will never be

694
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,090
in a bicycle race that I can tag

695
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,580
I will immediately terminate a

696
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,620
President Obama's illegal

697
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:09,150
executive order on immigration
immediately

698
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,600
fully support and backup

699
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,360
the Second Amendment now

700
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,780
very interesting today I heard through
stupidity

701
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,900
in a very very hardcore prison
interestingly name

702
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,530
clinton to vicious murders

703
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:35,390
to vicious people escaped and nobody
knows where they are

704
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,700
and a woman was on television this
morning

705
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,770
and she said you know mister juppe she
was telling other people like

706
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,260
actually called but she said you know
mister trap

707
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,370
I always was against god's I didn't want
guns

708
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:55,100
and now since this happened

709
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,100
its up in the prison area my husband and
I

710
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,840
are finally an agreement does he wanted
the guns we now have a gun on every

711
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,410
table

712
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:08,300
we're ready to start shooting I said
very interesting so

713
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,060
protect the second mm and

714
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,490
and Common Core

715
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:18,800
Common Core should

716
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,330
it is a disaster Bush is totally in
favor of Common Core

717
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:26,460
I don't see how he can possibly get the
nomination

718
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,760
he's we got immigration he's in favor of
Common Core

719
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,070
how the hell can you vote for this guy
you just can't do it

720
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:38,230
we have to end education has to be local

721
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,740
rebuild the country's

722
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,900
infrastructure nobody can do that

723
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,890
like me believe me it will be done on
time

724
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:53,470
on budget way below cost way below what
anyone ever thought

725
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,609
I look at these roads being built all
over the country

726
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,970
and I say I can build those things to
one-third what they do is

727
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,950
unbelievable how bad you know what
building

728
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:08,010
on pennsylvania avenue the Old Post
Office were converting it to

729
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,609
one of the world's great hotels could be
the best hotel in Washington DC

730
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:16,119
we got it from the general services
administration

731
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:22,880
in washington the O Parma administration
we got it it was the most highly sought

732
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,670
after all one of them but I think the
most highly sought after

733
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,190
project in the history up general
service

734
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,190
we got it people were shocked trumka

735
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,410
I got it for two reasons number one
we're really good number

736
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,440
do we had a really good plan and I lead
in the third

737
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,910
we had a great financial statement
because the general services who were

738
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,369
terrific people by the way

739
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:49,170
and talented people they wanted to do a
great job and they want to make sure got

740
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:49,619
built

741
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,180
so we have to rebuild our infrastructure

742
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,400
our bridges our roadways are airports
you come into LaGuardia Airport

743
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:03,119
it's like we're in a third world country
you look at the patches in the

744
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,190
forty-year-old floor they throw down
asphalt in a truck you look at these

745
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,680
airports we are like a third world
country

746
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,560
and I come in from China and I come in
from Qatar and I come in from

747
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,740
different places and they have the most
incredible airports in the world

748
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,720
you come back to this country and you
have LAX

749
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,250
disaster you have all these disasters

750
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:31,589
airports we have to rebuild are in for

751
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:34,449
save medicare medicaid

752
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:38,049
and social security without cuts have to
do it

753
00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:41,449
get rid of the fraud get whether the
real waste and abuse

754
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:45,289
but save it people have been paying in
three years

755
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:48,619
and now many these candidates want to
cut it you save it

756
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,859
by making the United States by make it
as rich again

757
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:55,160
by taking back all of the money that's
being lost

758
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,189
renegotiate are far in

759
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:05,309
trade deals reduce our

760
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:08,400
18 trillion in debt because believe me

761
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,749
were in a bubble we have artificially
low interest rates

762
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:17,390
we have a stock market that frankly it's
been good to me but I still hate to see

763
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,219
what's happening

764
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:21,929
we have a stock market that is so
bloated

765
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:26,380
be careful though the bubble because
what you've seen in the past might be

766
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,599
small potatoes

767
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:33,819
compared to what happens so be very very
careful and strengthen

768
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:37,669
our military and take care of our vets
so

769
00:50:37,669 --> 00:50:48,310
so import sadly

770
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,380
the American dream

771
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:58,650
is dead but if I get elected president

772
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,850
I will bring it back bigger

773
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:07,840
at better and stronger then ever before

774
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,850
and we will make America

775
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,530
great again thank you thank you very
much
